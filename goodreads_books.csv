The Bright Years,Sarah Damoff,4.30,"I can’t even see what I’m typing—my tears are pouring like a torrent. I’m crying like a baby with colic, and one thing is for sure: I just finished the BEST DEBUT FICTION of the year. The other thing? My heart is completely shattered.One family. Three perspectives—mother, father, and daughter. Broken hearts, grief, abuse, resentment, secrets, forgiveness, addiction, second-chance love, pain, sadness, invisible scars, child abandonment, teen motherhood, hope, promises—this book tackles so many triggering yet deeply thought-provoking themes through the epic, dramatic, raw, and profoundly emotional story of the Bright family.Ryan and Lily Bright’s first meeting in a library feels like the perfect rom-com ""meet-cute,"" the beginning of a love story between two flawed people, each hiding secrets that will shape their future in unexpected ways. Ryan comes from a broken home; his mother escaped an abusive relationship and raised him alone. He’s a photographer with big dreams of opening an art gallery, and though he vows to be a better man for Lily and a better father to their daughter, Georgette (aka Jet), he eventually falls into the same destructive patterns as his own father. Alcoholism steals him away from the life he tried to build, and one tragic mistake forces him to step back from his family.Lillian, too, carries a heavy secret—she gave up a child for adoption as a teen mom after her first love chose music over fatherhood. She thought she’d found her second chance with Ryan, but now watches helplessly as the man she once loved disappears into someone unrecognizable.Georgette is mostly raised by her Nana Elise, Ryan’s mother, and harbors deep resentment toward her parents for the secrets they kept. When she meets Davis—her mother’s adopted son—she begins to see the bigger picture and discovers the possibility of creating her own chosen family. As she begins to understand the weight of her parents’ decisions, her perspective begins to shift.No words I write here can truly do justice to how powerful this book is. It turned me into a red-eyed, heart-wrecked mess. I deeply empathized with Lillian, Ryan, and Jet—their mistakes, pain, love, and longing—and it all resonated with my own feelings, regrets, and hopes. This story reminds us that no family is perfect, and no parent has all the answers. But love means showing up, trying again, and holding on, even when it’s hard.What more can I say? I’m speechless. I wholeheartedly loved every chapter, every character, every ache, and every word in this book. It’s already etched into my heart, and without a doubt, it’s my pick for Best Debut of the Year.Ten gazillion stars.Endless thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for providing me with a digital reviewer copy of this stunning debut in exchange for my honest thoughts. I’m beyond grateful.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","This book destroyed me💔The Bright Years is a debut novel that tells the story of four generations over three parts and the span of six decades. I loved how each part came with a change in narration so we get to see their lives, in that moment, from a different perspective. Coming from someone who lives in Fort Worth, this story definitely feels like a love letter to the city. So many familiar mentions that made me wish I'd have known Cowtown at the same time as Ryan and Lillian Bright, and their daughter Georgette ""Jet"" Bright. I went into this one blindly so I don't want to give away too much. Just know that you will feel like your hearts been ripped out, more than once, but will see that under all the heartbreak that life can throw at you, hope often remains.  ""Loss keeps a tight grip when there's hope left"" I just finished but I already want to do a reread, this time with a highlighter ready for all the quotes and moments that hit me so hard. Beautifully written characters that you'll think about long after the book ends. 5 stars. All the stars. Cannot recommend this one enough. Read it!•Debut•Multiple POV•Past + Present timelines•Found family•Second chance romance","💝😭I didn't know happiness could feel so sad💝😭.  The Bright Years written by Sarah Damoff broke my heart and shredded it to pieces. I don't think I will ever be able to recover from this heart shattering novel. I had so many emotions while reading this beautiful yet gut wrenching story, it's a bit hard to describe, but I ugly sobbed, I laughed, I smiled, I was angry. The Bright Years was the BEST debut novel I have ever read. If you haven't read this book yet, please go do so immediately because you definitely won't want to miss out on having your heart broken, by the half way point I honestly lost count of how many times I was ugly sobbing. Despite how heart breaking this book was, there was so much love, compassion, and light shining through the pages. The Bright Years is a two hundred and eighty-eight page love story that is filled with triumphs and tragedies. The snot bubbles were bubbling. I have seen so many reviewers saying this book destroyed them, I can say it destroyed me too, but I don't think you can understand this type of pain until you read this book.  The Bright Years will definitely hold a special place in my heart forever.  Six decades of love, pain, joy, tragedies, and triumphs, what more could you want? Please do yourself a favor, if you haven't already go pick up this book immediately because I think it will become a favorite for so many people in 2025, I also wouldn't be surprised if this book makes it to the Goodreads challenge at the end of the year because it was just that damn good. I think my messy bun and tear stained face have seen better days, but while I was reading this book I was an ugly sobbing mess. I could go on and on about how much I absolutely loved this book, but I want other people to experience the pain that I felt while reading this heart stopping story.

The Bright family consists of Lillian, Ryan, and their daughter Georgette. Before Lillian Bright was a married woman and mama, she was a bare faced back teller who usually kept to herself. Lillian lost her mom to cancer and she lost her father to a T-boned accident caused by a drunk driver. Between 1973-1974, Lillian decides to get intimate with Zack Melendez who is a country singer that's always on the road. In 1974, Lillian gives birth to Zack's baby and gives the baby up for adoption, meanwhile Zack had no clue about Lillian's pregnancy nor about her placing their child up for adoption. During her days as a bank teller, Lillian meets Ryan because he's amazed by her beauty. In February 1982, Lillian and Ryan get married and become the Brights. During their newly wed years, Lillian gets pregnant again, but soon has a miscarriage. In 1986, Lillian gives birth to a baby girl, Georgette. Ryan Bright has dreamed of owning an art gallery as a very young child. Six months into their relationship, Ryan was the first one to say ""I love you"" to Lillian. In 1987, Ryan starts drinking alcohol, but insists he's not an alcoholic because he never wants to turn out like his abusive father. There were so many secrets between Ryan and Lillian. Ryan becomes abusive one night after throwing a beer bottle at Lillian, he decides to move out and live a double life. Ryan chose alcohol over his own family, he's living a part time fatherhood, he shows up drunk to events and celebrations, but as the alcohol consumes his life, Ryan misses out on so much of his own daughter's childhood. Ryan and Lillian never filed for divorce despite living separate lives from each other. In 2000, Ryan becomes nine months sober. In 2001, Ryan continues to be twenty months sober and still lives in a separate apartment because he doesn't want to disappoint his wife and daughter. In 2001, Ryan re-proposes to Lillian on their daughters fifteenth birthday and the Fourth of July because he wants to make his family happy again, meanwhile they were never divorced. When Ryan picks up drinking again, he starts becoming emotionally abusive towards Georgette. In 2019, Ryan is five years, seven months, and two hundred and ninety one weeks sober. It was so hard to watch the Bright family crumble, but it was even harder not to celebrate their milestones despite everything they have been through. Throughout the years, the Brights story unspools, and their story is one of secrecy, denial, truths, revelations, many regrets, so much redemption, inheritances along the way, and the Bright family legacy. Despite their mistakes, the Bright family will forever hold a special place in my heart, I wish all of them the best of luck in this world. Excuses can't be made for abusers, but the growth Ryan did was truly inspiring in so many ways. Georgette Bright is named after Lillian's mama and her middle name Elise is named after Ryan's mama and of course her nickname is Jet. It was so hard watching Georgette tackle her childhood with her part time father, but Georgette and Lillian were the best mother-daughter duo. During her childhood, Georgette gets a border collie mix, and of course she names him Stethoscope because she wants to be the best doctor in the world, this part was just the absolute cutest. in 2000, Georgette gets into photography just like her father. During her childhood years, Georgette earns the nickname ""Curious Georgette"" because she was always curious about everything and her favorite show was Curious George. Between the years of 2001 and 2002, Georgette moves in with her nana Elise because of some very terrible news. in 2009, Georgette gets a random email from someone named Davis Condie, well fast forward in 2009, Georgette and Davis decide to meet, these two are a mirror image of each other, Davis and Georgette are half siblings. In 2010, Georgette gets accepted into nursing school, YOU GO GIRL!!!!!! I absolutely loved watching Georgette grow up and become the young woman that she is, she never let anything deter her despite the rough childhood she had to endure, she was just a shining light. I know this is just a book, but I feel like the Bright family can be so inspiring to so many people. It's truly the hardest thing ever not to root for someone despite the mistakes they made along the way while trying to be better for themselves and those around them. Anything is possible if you put your best self, trust, and mind into it from the beginning."
Julie Chan Is Dead,Liann Zhang,3.56,"I know that Chloe normally looks more put together, but compared to a corpse, I must look okay, right?
Huh, I don't quite know how to feel about this. Suffice to say, this is one of the more unhinged books I've read in quite some time.Julie Chan has always been envious of her twin Chloe's life. While Julie rotted away under the care of her abusive aunt after their parents died, Chloe was adopted by a wealthy white couple and grew up amidst money and luxury. When Chloe became a famous influencer, Julie followed from afar, glimpsing into what could've been her life, if only. So when Chloe suddenly dies, Julie naturally seizes the chance to live her twin's life. But the longer Julie masquerades as Chloe, the more she starts to realize that something is amiss.I have to admit, the part of the premise that got me to read this book was the twin switcheroo bit. It felt very Lindsay Lohan and The Parent Trap. That was such a memorable movie from my childhood, I figured if this switcheroo was half as fun, it'd be worth the read. And it was fun, but with some caveats (and a lot of cringing).First, this story is crazy, like really unhinged, insane, heretofore unseen levels of crazy. It starts out with a pretty wacky premise and it only gets more so from there. Not only is the plotline crazy, but so is each and every one of the characters. So you've been warned. It's best to just lay back and enjoy the ride, and not worry about how it may or may not be based in reality. Second, this is very much geared towards a certain audience, and truth be told, that's where I started to feel a disconnect with the story. You know, I'm not that hip and I'm certainly not that young, so there were a lot of references and even some lingo in here I've never heard of before. I also don't TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, or even Instagram much, and I certainly don't follow any influencers or care about their lifestyles. So I definitely felt a bit like an outsider reading this story.Also, I floundered trying to determine the meaning behind this tale. The lack of likable characters and character growth made it hard to discern something out of the pure chaos this ended up being. And maybe there is no more meaningful message here other than that it's a good story, and I'm trying to make something out of nothing. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing, and I was waiting for more.It's clear this is a satire, but for me, in order for that to work, I have to be able to relate to the characters and also understand the underlying commentary. And I just couldn't quite get there on both fronts with this one.Still, I was impressed with this debut's ability to keep me engaged, even through its zanier moments. In the end, it was a fun/cringey way to spend a few hours, so I can't complain too much.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","this was a very #weird and #unhinged but #kindoffuntoread thriller! i didn't absolutely hate it!julie chan is broke, bitter, and quite anonymous—the antithesis of her twin chloe van huusen, an affluent social media influencer who was adopted by a rich family while julie was left with her aunt. they grew apart after being separated, and julie’s resentment and envy only deepened over time—understandably so. the only time chloe bothered to talk to her out of the blue was to buy her a house to milk the internet's sympathy for profit, and even then she still had a patronizing attitude towards julie. thus, she never bothered to genuinely create a healthy relationship with her twin. so, once chloe mysteriously died of a drug overdose, julie took over her life under her name. good for her, i guess!i started this thinking it would be strikingly similar to yellowface, and it was for the first 40%— a commentary on identity, influencers, and internet fame. once the influencer retreat started on a secluded island, everything spiraled. can't say i don't love a bit of capitalist culty horror/insanity and deranged women moment, though. i don't doubt rich people can be this diabolical in reality.to me, this book kind of exuded scientology, bunny by mona awad (from what i've heard, i haven't read it yet but i will update this when i do), and midsommar. that ending was something!while this is no yellowface (which i personally prefer), if you like weird books and need a quick pick-me-up with absurd yet somewhat entertaining women, then this one is not a bad option! there's lots of murder, obsession, drugs, strange rituals and mantras, and mass brainwashing, which is always intriguing and slightly addictive.thank you to the publishers for the e-arc!-pre-reviewwhat 😦 (i promise i’ll write the review tomorrow)-pre-readgot inspired by joni to pick the arcs back up and they're also due in 13 days so i need to lock in!!-tbr reviewgot the arc! hopefully this serves cause i loved yellowface","Well, this thriller/dark comedy is absolutely riveting—an undeniably intriguing mystery I simply couldn't put down! I can confidently say that a brilliant new thriller author has arrived with an impactful debut that explores the addiction of voyeurism and the dark side of social media—pushing people to extreme lengths, from stealing the identity of an influencer to impersonating a very dead sister, and even more than you could ever imagine—all to stay at the top.I especially loved the first half, which focuses on Julie Chan, who was separated from her twin, Chloe, after a tragic accident left them orphaned. While Julie was adopted by her manipulative and abusive aunt, Chloe was fortunate enough to be taken in by the wealthy and influential VanHuusen couple, who provided her with the glamorous lifestyle of her dreams—luxurious living in New York, the best education, summers in the Hamptons, and elite social connections.As Julie struggles to survive, working as a supermarket cashier with no access to the privileges Chloe enjoys, her sister basks in the spotlight as a powerful influencer with millions of followers. Even when Chloe briefly reconnects with Julie at her workplace—offering her a rundown house in need of renovations just to create content and boost her online engagement—she soon ghosts her again, leaving Julie more hurt than she expected.Then, out of nowhere, Chloe calls Julie with a cryptic message before abruptly hanging up. Concerned, Julie rushes to her sister’s New York apartment—only to find her dead. When the police arrive and mistake Julie for Chloe, a dangerous idea takes root. Resentment, ambition, and a deep desire to escape her own circumstances push Julie to step into her sister’s shoes.After all, she’s watched enough of Chloe’s videos to imitate her perfectly. How hard could it be to post content, keep smiling, make paid collaborations, and hang out with socialites like Bella Marie—the ultra-rich queen bee eager to take ""Chloe"" under her wing?But as Julie embraces her sister’s life, she grows suspicious about Chloe’s strained relationship with her adoptive family and her connection to a journalist with whom she was about to share a scandalous story before her death. What secrets was Chloe keeping? Was her death really an accident, or did someone want her gone?Then comes the invitation—Bella insists that Julie join her and a group of influencers for an exclusive retreat on a secluded island with no phone reception. The retreat’s attendees are eerily secretive about their past visits, and as soon as Julie steps onto Bella’s family's island, she realizes that assuming Chloe’s identity may have led her somewhere far more dangerous than she ever anticipated.Overall:I absolutely loved the first half of this book—the mystery surrounding Chloe was gripping and deeply immersive. The second half, set on the exotic island, took a wilder, more mind-bending turn that was slightly over the top for my taste, but I still enjoyed the dark humor woven throughout. If you’re looking for something fresh, sharp, entertaining, thought-provoking, and completely unputdownable, I highly recommend this book!Put this on your radar—don’t wait to read it, just dive in! This is one of those hidden gems that will absolutely captivate book lovers.Many thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me with a digital reviewer copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<"
The Amalfi Curse,Sarah Penner,3.93,"Just like I devoured Sarah Penner's previous historical fantasy works, I went into this book blind and completely enjoyed the two intertwining timelines. The story follows witches of the sea who protect the Amalfi Coast, and centuries later, a woman archaeologist searches for a mysterious treasure. I was sold from the first chapter.The gripping, fast-paced storytelling, Mari, Holmes, and Haven's intriguing perspectives, the sea witches' powerful incantations, and the heart-pounding, thrilling fight against the Mazza Fratelli (Brothers) kept me on the edge of my seat. Haven's discoveries, her secret mission to honor her father's wishes, her blossoming love story with Enzo, and the detailed, alluring descriptions of Amalfi that made me want to book an immediate trip to Italy completely drew me into the story.The past and present timelines perfectly intertwined, and the outcome was far more satisfying than I expected.Here's a quick recap of the storyline:Haven Ambrose, a skilled nautical archaeologist, makes an agreement with a startup tech company and assembles her own team of women archaeologists for Project Relic. Their mission is to dive around the Amalfi Coast in search of mysterious shipwrecks and relics. What her team doesn't know is that her recently deceased father had previously dived in the same location and discovered priceless gemstones. He left coordinates and underwater photos for Haven to help her find the treasures.However, Haven didn't anticipate the tragedy at Li Galli, where a yacht sinks, killing eight people, including popular influencers. The project's chauvinist CEO assigns Conrad, an experienced archaeologist and rival of her father who once saved her life underwater, to lead a new team.Haven grows suspicious of Conrad's maneuver to take over her project. Could he know about her father's secret treasure hunt and volunteered to search for it under the guise of a professional assignment? Determined not to leave Positano, she visits a diving shop to rent a boat and equipment, which leads her to meet Enzo and start her own adventure.Simultaneously, the narrative takes us back to 1821, where a young, powerful sea witch named Mari finds herself in a dilemma. She plans to leave Positano with her sailor lover Holmes when dangerous, corrupt men begin hunting down witches to exploit their powers, kidnapping four of them.Overall, this is an intriguing, innovative, and captivating historical fantasy that you absolutely shouldn't miss!Many thanks to NetGalley and Harlequin Trade Publishing for sharing this brilliant fantasy's digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter","PHENOMENAL!! Thank you NetGalley, Sarah Penner, and Harlequin Trade Publishing/Park Row for granting me access to this book in exchange for an honest review. Wow! Just PERFECTION!!! What a beautifully written and captivating historical fantasy filled with forbidden love, powerful magic, sunken treasure, mysterious shipwrecks all set along the Amalfi Coast. After devouring The Lost Apothecary, I eagerly anticipated Penner’s next adventure—and this one soared beyond every expectation. It’s her most dazzling work yet, and easily one of my top reads of 2025.🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵The novel’s dual narratives, one unfolding in the vibrant streets and coves of modern day Positano, the other in a storm battered 17th‑century village, are woven together with flawless precision. Each chapter in the past mirrors and magnifies the mysteries Haven Ambrose faces in the present.Haven, a fearless nautical archaeologist, arrives in Positano determined to recover the priceless gemstones her late father nearly found, and to probe the string of bizarre shipwrecks plaguing the coast. As she dives into sunken hulls and braves treacherous maelstroms, she uncovers an ancient legend of stregheria, a sea‑based magic once wielded by a woman desperate to save her love and her community. Could this same sorcery be the source of Positano’s latest disasters? Haven must unravel the Amalfi Curse before nature’s fury, and something far more sinister, devours the region.In summary, this bewitching novel shimmers with mystery, romance and the untamed magic of the sea. I am utterly enchanted and wholeheartedly recommend it!! Infinite gleaming 🌟 ✨⭐️💫🌟!!!!!","i enjoyed this so much! gave me very similar vibes to THE LOST APOTHECARY and i’m always in awe of how many side plots + genres Sarah Penner can weave into a 300 page book!read if you like: good settings / Italian coast, magical realism (witchcraft/spells), forbidden romance, adventure and “treasure hunting” vibes, themes on family and friendship, multiple POVsthe setting of this was a VIBE! and this book was so quick to read—it pulled me in immediately and i finished in 2 sittings. it flips from the 1800s plot to current day and i was equally as invested in both POVs which is rare (usually i care about one way more than the other). there was romance, there was mystery, there was magic, there was Italian exploration and limoncello, there was friendship, there was adventure… like it truly had it all! and the way she weaves it all together at the end 👏🏼🎧 the audiobook is a full cast/mainly narrated by my faveeee Saskia Maarleveld and i’m kinda sad i didn’t experience that version, but physical was a blast as well! my only “complaint” from making this 5 stars would be that with so much going on, it’s a bit harder to feel REALLY attached to one character/plot/etc but that’s also not necessarily a bad thing. i was just missing that emotional connection with 1-2 characters bc there were a handful of them. TLDR; deff worth the read!!"
The Floating World,Axie Oh,3.99,"The Floating World is Final Fantasy meets reimagined celestial maiden Korean folklore, with a generous dash of RPG storytelling and it starts out with a bang. A claws-out, people-dying, secret-magic-to-fight-demonic-creature kind of bang. The Ghibliesque-adjacent worldbuilding is lush and strange with murderous mercenary train journeys, a pitch-black Under World filled with poisonous blue clouds and toxic mines, and a world quite literally floating above it all. It's all beautifully rendered, but never overindulgent. The stakes hit fast and hard and the emotional undercurrent is real. There’s blood, grief, memory loss, scientific experimentation and family, real and found, but it never felt like too much was going on.What I didn’t expect was how tender the heart of this story would be. Beneath the sword fights and yearning is a story about trauma: inherited, inflicted, survived. What it means to be soft without being weak. And about reclamation of identity and memory. It didn’t hit instantly for me. Probably due to me taking a while to connect with FMC, Ren, who felt too naive for her age, plus the third-person narration, which kept me emotionally distanced for a while. That’s a “me” problem, I know. Plus, after the banging start, it was a slower burn, with the first half moving like a side quest-heavy RPG, all mood and mystery. To be fair, however, it really builds up to a gripping crescendo. Once the character work clicked for me, The Floating World soared, with the last third steeped in love, grief and heart-wrenching reveals. It got under my skin. Made me care more than I expected. And that’s what elevated my rating in the end. I need the sequel. Immediately. Please protect our sadboy, Cloud Strife x Wolverine Sunho at all costs. Thank you so much to Hodder & Stoughton for the opportunity to read this arc in exchange for an honest review!﹏﹏﹏﹏﹏﹏It took me a few go's to settle in, but now I'm 20% in and invested by an amnesiac sword-for-hire and a theatre troupe performer with mysterious powers who just killed a demon.

Ren~
 once a princess, a celestian maiden like her mother; now we meet the lively care-free her in the present, after 10 years when she left her empire behind and came to live as troupe perfomer with her adopted family. She's the heir to the Floating World, but everyone believes she has been perished along with her mother during Festival of Light, all those years ago. She's content and happy with her little family now. But as fate might have it, her happiness is only lasted for a little time until one night a demon appears and takes the life of her loved one. She soon realises she has to make a choice- it's to go back to where she came from to protect her little family that was her home. She goes on a journey back home to find a cure and save her little uncle who is in the bring of death because of the demon.
Sunho~
 He works as a sword-for-hire by taking up tasks in the underworld. He was an ex-soldier, but he doesn't remember anything up until two years ago except that he has a brother, which frustrates him and that's why he is emotionally closed off and doesn't trust anyone. He soon gets a task, to find the princess and bring her alive inechange for finding his brother. Ren & Sunho soon cross paths on their journey, saving each other from dangers, but also lying to each other about their true identies. I literally loved how they grow close to each other, the more time they spend with each other. They both let down their walls layer by layer, and let each other in. Their romance was so subtle, but still so realistic in this book. I also loved how because of Ren, Sunho changed his perspectives. He chose to protect her instead of giving her up to the monsters who wanted to kill her. His fierce protectiveness towards her was something I swooned over 😩💓 I can't wait to see how the story unfolds in the sequel, I'm already on my way to request the arc for the next one 🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️Thank you to the Author, Macmillan Publishers, and Netgalley for this beautiful ARC inexchange for an honest review 🥰💞life update: sorry besties, I couldn't do my updates here for this one as some of you know I had some family emergency the past week to take care of, and had no mood to read. I just binge read this in a day! Anyways I'm back after a week long hiatus and I can't wait to see what you all reading atm, I will catch up soon!🤭 ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⤿🔮 25/04/25my first Axie Oh book, and that too an arc??🤭 lowkey the cover is giving me studio ghibli vibes 😍 I hope it makes me float, let's gooooo 🤸🏻‍♀️","4 stars! 🌟 Huge thanks to Macmillan Children's Publishing Group | Feiwel & Friends for the ARC & Dreamscape Media for the ALC via NetGalley! ﻿💌Okay, but Axie Oh, you genius, what have you done to me?! This book was a whirlwind of magic, adventure, and emotions, and I was absolutely hooked! A breathtaking blend of celestial magic, Korean mythology, and high-stakes adventure, this YA fantasy will consume your soul. ﻿💘✨ Let’s talk about the setup! We’ve got Ren, a cheerful acrobat with a hidden power she definitely shouldn’t have used in public (oops). And Sunho, an ex-soldier with a sword, a tragic backstory, and a memory gap big enough to fit an entire war. Their paths collide in the most chef’s kiss way, and suddenly, Ren is being hunted, Sunho is questioning everything, and we’re on a journey across a world so beautifully crafted it could be a Studio Ghibli film. 🎭🔥 THE GOOD STUFF:✔ The world-building?!? IMMACULATE. Axie Oh doesn’t dump info on you—she weaves it into the story so seamlessly that you’re just in the world, no confusion, no boredom, just pure ✨ magic ✨.✔ Ren & Sunho? Absolutely precious. Their bond grows so naturally, and the slow burn romance? I felt it in my bones. Sunho calling her by her name for the first time nearly ended me. 💕✔ The vibes? Impeccable. Dark underworlds, celestial magic, acrobat performances, sword fights—I was living for it. 🔥💥 THE TINY NITPICKS:❗ The last 20% felt a little rushed—I wanted the action scenes to stretch out longer, give me more tension, drama, and heartbreak! I needed that final battle to wreck me, and it almost did.❗ Some side characters (Jaeil, I’m looking at you) needed more page time. GIVE ME MORE OF THEM IN BOOK 2, PLEASE.Final verdict? If you love gorgeous world-building, an addicting plot, soft yet fierce romance, and a touch of mythological magic, The Floating World is your next obsession. Book 2 can’t come soon enough! 💫"
The Staircase in the Woods,Chuck Wendig,3.70,"Okay, so never climb random staircases sitting in the woods. Got it. I mean, I don't think I have the requisite amount of bravery needed to do such a thing anyway (I would have hauled myself in the opposite direction so quickly that there would have been a smoke trail) and I probably never would have agreed to camp out in the woods to begin with (eww, bugs), but it's still good to have a list of this stuff, I think.But, yeah, this one was creepy. It's hard to say much without spoiling things, but it leans pretty heavily on the classic “a group of friends return home to right a supernatural wrong that occurred when they were teenagers” trope. That's not a bad thing – it's one of my favorite tropes in all of literature, probably due to me having read Stephen King's It at far too young and influenceable of an age – but expect the usual flashbacks and adults with major unresolved trauma and such. And it is kind of It-ish in parts: the initial summoning home by the one person who stayed behind, the single female friend who is the object of a secret crush, the fat kid turned not fat adult, and a teenage gangbang. Ha ha, just kidding on that last one … that's all King (thank goodness). Once the adult group of friends – and I don't think I'm spoiling anything to say this because the book blurb hints at it really, really strongly – ascend the staircase in the woods for the second time, things get supremely wonky. Everything that comes afterward is (initially) confusing and disturbing and kind of sad, but it's also completely enthralling. It's a horror story, for sure, but it's also a story of friendship and guilt and grief and letting go of the past, and it's almost unputdownable (figuratively, anyway - I had to put it down a lot since my husband being home from work for two weeks totally disrupted my reading schedule).My one minor complaint? The writing is a little repetitive at times. It's mostly unavoidable due to the nature of the book, I think, but there's definitely a lot of rehashing the same subjects and doing the same things over and over. It isn't a huge distraction from the story and it's kind of necessary to the plot, but it's something to be aware of, I suppose. So, yeah. Overall, The Staircase in the Woods a creepy and entertaining read that takes an old horror trope in new directions. If you're a fan of creepy staircase horror (which may or may not be a subgenre that I just made up), definitely considering giving this one a read. 4.35 stars, rounded down.Many thanks to NetGalley and Del Ray for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review. It's expected publication date is April 29, 2025.","Each story where a group of young adults faces a tragedy and reunites years later to confront a monster reminds me of Stephen King’s It—one of my favorite plotlines. Chuck Wendig's unique twist, blending this concept with a mysterious staircase in the woods, immediately drew me in!The story transported me back to my teenage years, recalling the excitement of locking myself away with a gripping book, eyes burning from exhaustion but too captivated to stop reading. Now, as an adult, I found myself sneaking in pages whenever I could—whether I was cooking, working, or even watching TV, the story kept pulling me back.Wendig’s novel delves into broken friendships, guilt, abandonment, and deeply-rooted fears. It follows five friends who, as teenagers, made a pact to always protect each other. But one fateful night in the woods, their bond shatters when they discover a staircase leading to a terrifying unknown. When one of them, Matty, vanishes after jumping in, their lives are forever changed. Questions about Matty’s disappearance haunt them for twenty years, until Nick, the friend who never gave up the search, calls them back for a reunion.As adults, they’re scarred and broken in different ways. Owen, trapped by trauma and OCD, works in a bookstore. Lor, the successful but lonely game designer, still carries guilt for betraying Owen years ago. Hamish, who has drastically transformed, now lives a polished, suburban life. Meanwhile, Nick is unchanged—still obsessed with finding Matty and the answers they never got. Now, he’s found the staircases again.The reunion isn’t what it seems. When the group follows Nick into the eerie woods, they face not only the staircase but their own worst nightmares. The house they enter feeds on their deepest fears, forcing them to confront long-buried secrets.At first, I struggled with some characters—Nick's bluntness and Lor’s narcissism irritated me—but their growth throughout the story shifted my perspective. The suspense, twists, and pacing kept me hooked, and the mystery was brilliantly executed.Overall, this is a gripping, dark fantasy thriller with well-developed characters and a chilling atmosphere. I’m rounding my 4.5 stars up to 5, and I can’t wait for Wendig’s next book!Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House/Del Rey for providing me with a digital reviewer copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","Terrifying, gripping, nostalgic, and creepy, The Staircase in the Woods grabbed my attention and never let go! I was instantly drawn into the dual timeline story about a group of friends, the past, the present, and all the things in-between. I had a hard time putting this book down as I was fully invested in learning what happened when five friends walked into the woods and only four came out! I don't know about you but if I am walking in the woods and see a staircase, I won’t be climbing it. Just saying. Nothing good can come of it, and yet five teenage friends on a camping trip are intrigued and decide to climb........ Twenty years after the night they found a staircase in the woods, four friends came home. Their lives have taken them in different directions, and they lost touch after that fateful camping trip. But they have been invited back and hope to find their missing friend once and for all. If you are getting It vibes, you are not alone. But The Staircase in the Woods stands on its own (pun intended) and Wendig delivers a creepy and terrifying tale of friendship, abandonment, grief, loss, guilt, love, and the things that haunt us. I loved the creepy and eerie vibe of this book. I also loved the tension, the atmosphere, the sense of danger that oozed throughout the book, the vivid descriptions, and the heaviness of the character's feelings. Don't even get me started on the ending! Creepy, tense, well thought out, and hard to put down!4.5 starsThank you to Random House Worlds | Del Rey and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Gifted & Talented,Olivie Blake,3.69,"The book definitely finished me. Definitely couldn't do this one in one sitting 😅- Full review soon ➽──────────────❥Olivie Blake writes it... I not only buy it, but I devour it in one sitting. 👀🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️Here we go! 🤞🏻❤️❤️Urban Fantasy ❤️Sibling Drama❤️Superpowers❤️Sharp, Witty Prose❤️Succession Vibes❤️Pretentious/Asshole x Fascinating Characters","— 4.5/5 stars ☆this review took me exactly 4 days to write and I’m not even extravaganting. the book was too complex to review so I had to take a lot of time to break it down as simply as I can and still I don’t think I’ll ever do a perfect job of reviewing it. there are books that entertain, books that challenge, and then there are books like this one—the kind that pull you in so deeply that you have no choice but to give in to the brilliance. meredith Wren, arthur wren, and eilidh wren—these are not just characters. they are forces of nature, each one carrying the weight of their privilege, their intelligence, their impossible expectations. the book doesn’t just tell their stories—it immerses you in their psyches, making you feel like you’re eavesdropping on the most intimate, biting, and devastating conversations of their lives.the book felt electric. there’s a rhythm to the writing, a kind of poetic, hyper-intelligent banter that makes every paragraph feel like a scene from a screenplay. It’s as if Aaron Sorkin and Sally Rooney had a literary love child, but then that child was raised on dark academia, speculative fiction, and biting satire. the dialogue is quick, sharp, and demanding—so much so that I found myself flipping back a few pages just to make sure I caught all the nuances of what was being said. It’s a book that refuses to spoon-feed you, I loved/ hated that about it.when I finished it the first thing that came to mind was that this book could turn into one of the most, intellectually gripping screen adaptations—if (and it’s a big if) a director was willing to commit to the complexity of the dialogue and the intricacies of the characters. the quick cuts between intense boardroom confrontations, confessions, and supernatural catastrophes would be cinematic gold. But here’s the thing—half of the magic in this book lives in prose/writing if you get what I’m saying. the internal monologues, the uncomfortable self-awareness of the characters, the way the words themselves crackle with wit and tragedy—might make it too hard for this to be a movie 😭 about writing & Plot & Pacing & characters (the characters that you will definitely hate)this book is about the Wren siblings—Meredith, Arthur, and Eilidh—each entangled in their own personal crises, from corporate fraud to supernatural abilities and political downfall. The book is a character-driven about power, privilege, and the consequences of ambition.۫ ꣑ৎ ┊ meredith wren - she is introduced as the CEO of a company whose flagship product, Chirp, is marketed as a biomantic breakthrough that can manufacture happiness. however, quickly raises questions about the ethicals of her work and the legitimacy of her product. she’s the kind of character who would be played by a powerhouse actress—someone like Cate Blanchett (specially her) or Rooney Mara, who can radiate untouchable intelligent and devastating vulnerability all at once. meredith is ruthless, calculating, deeply flawed, and yet I couldn’t look away from her. her moral compromises, her hunger for power, her deeply buried wounds—you hate, admire, and fear her all at once.۫ ꣑ৎ ┊ arthur wren - he is another beast entirely. he’s both the golden boy and the tragic figure, a politician who wants to do good but is drowning in his own failures, his powerlessness, and his supernatural abilities. there’s an irony to Arthur—he’s supposed to be the one with influence, the one who should be able to change the world, and yet he’s the most lost of them all. His struggle feels painfully relevant, it’s like what happens when idealism meets an unmovable system.۫ ꣑ৎ ┊ eilidh wren - used to be a ballerina, but now she’s stuck in a marketing job at her father’s company—except there’s something inside her, something she doesn’t understand. It’s not just strange; it’s terrifying. It feels old, otherworldly, something eldritch and apocalyptic. like it doesn’t belong in her body or in this world at all. her story is the one that lingers. there’s something unsettling about it, something that makes reality feel thin, like it could crack at any moment. Goes to something cosmic and uncontrollable. her chapters are where things start to slip—where ballet recitals blur into visions of apocalypse that actually happened in manifest, where time and space don’t behave the way they should.the writing has sharp wit, a very dense prose, and an intellectual, almost literary style with modern speculative fiction elements. the writing is rich with internal monologues, biting humor, and great world-building, the narrative is as much about voice as it is about plot. the sentences are often long and winding, packed with keen observations and clever asides that make the text feel both sophisticated and self-aware and sometimes very very suffocating.😭 the use of parentheticals and fragmented thoughts that Olivie gave the book a conversational yet intricately constructed feel, I can see that only a few group of people will actually be able to put up with this because to be honest, it’s exhausting lmaoo. the pacing leans to slow development. however, the stakes will sometimes escalate quickly between chapters, particularly as each character is confronted with their own downfall since they’re all setting on the edge. but to be honest the structure allows for a gradual build-up.the book challenges, but rewards in my opinion. this is not a book you breeze through. It’s a book you wrestle with. you have to sit with the dialogue, re-read the interactions, absorb the layers of meaning in every exchange. the intelligence in this book is relentless—it doesn’t dumb anything down, and it assumes its readers are sharp enough to keep up.that being said, I can see how it could be polarizing. some readers will love its complexity, its Sorkin-esque dialogue, its deep dives into philosophy, technology, and morality. others might find it too dense, too caught up in its own intellectualism. but for the ones willing to engage with it, to really lean in to the world it creates, the reward is great! so I can see from now before the book is out that people are going to really enjoy it or absolutely hate it. no in between.it gets under your skin. It’s smart, ambitious, it’s fearless in the way it portrays power, dysfunctional family dynamic, and the consequences of ambition. It’s literary fiction wrapped in speculative dark fantasy fiction, with a side of thriller and political drama. It’s the kind of book you finish and immediately want to discuss, dissect, and argue about.would I recommend it? Without hesitation. but I’d also say this: don’t expect a light read. Expect to be challenged. Expect to feel like you’re watching a brilliant film where every line of dialogue demands your attention. Expect to have to flip back a few pages to catch the nuances you missed. And most importantly, expect to hate the characters deeply.— thank you Tor publishing group for an arc, and thank you macMillan audio for an alc!!",this sounds like magic succession(review to come / thanks to the publisher for the e-arc)
The Eights,Joanna  Miller,3.85,"Joanna Miller’s debut novel is that rare thing an intelligent, literary page-turner. Primarily set at Oxford University in the early 1920s, it follows the fortunes of four undergraduates, part of the first group of women admitted to study for a full degree. Enrolled at St. Hugh’s college for women, the four are placed in adjacent rooms, a happenstance that leads to the gradual formation of strong bonds between them. There’s Beatrice from Bloomsbury, daughter of a prominent suffragette; Marianne a shy vicar’s daughter; Dora who’s still reeling from the loss of both her boyfriend and brother in the trenches of WW1; and irrepressible, glamourous socialite Otto. Although they might sound dangerously close to stock, in Miller’s capable hands her characters come to life, making it hard not to root for them. They’re sympathetic yet convincingly flawed. I liked that she doesn’t try to make them too modern, instead she shows how women like these may have internalised many of the era’s uncomfortable attitudes - from class prejudice to restrictive feminine ideals – but still struggled against them, searching for new ways of thinking and being. Miller inserts flashbacks to provide insights into her characters’ formative experiences, most of which trace back to the trauma of war, time spent as volunteers with the wounded, fractured relationships, harsh awakenings. But her steadfast women refuse to let the blatant misogyny of large swathes of male students and lecturers get in their way; willing to take chances and embrace radical possibilities. The four eagerly await the publication of a crime novel from rising author Agatha Christie; debate the burning questions of the age; follow rapidly-shifting fashions, cropping their hair and raising their hemlines – for Beatrice Radclyffe Hall’s singular style’s both revelation and inspiration. Miller’s narrative’s well-crafted and well-researched, there’s a real depth to her rendering of her characters’ immediate and wider historical context - and loved the cameo appearances from Vera Brittain and Winifred Holtby. It’s a keenly-observed, absorbing portrait of the time, of a moment in women’s history, and above all of friendship forged in the aftermath of war. Fascinating, sometimes unexpectedly moving, utterly gripping. Thanks to Netgalley and publisher Fig Tree for an ARC","Joanna Miller’s The Eights is a breathtaking, deeply moving novel that swept me away from the very first page. Set in 1920, at a time when women were just beginning to carve out space for themselves in academic institutions that had long shut them out, this story follows four remarkable young women who find themselves bound together by both circumstance and an unshakable friendship.Beatrice, Dora, Otto, and Marianne—each carrying their own burdens, secrets, and dreams—become known as ""The Eights"" when they move into neighboring rooms in Oxford’s Corridor 8. But what begins as a simple coincidence quickly transforms into something far more profound. Through heartbreak, personal loss, academic battles, and the ever-present weight of societal expectations, these women find strength in one another, forming a sisterhood that feels both fragile and indestructible all at once.Miller’s writing is nothing short of mesmerizing, balancing historical accuracy with raw, emotional depth. She doesn’t just tell us about the struggles these women face—she makes us feel them. We walk alongside Dora as she wrestles with grief, knowing she is only here because war stole the lives of the men in her family. We hold our breath as Marianne desperately hides a truth that could upend everything she has worked for. We ache with Otto as she tries to reclaim pieces of herself after serving as a war nurse, and we cheer for Beatrice as she refuses to let misogynistic professors and sneering male students determine her worth.What makes The Eights so special is the way it captures the resilience of women—how they hold each other up, how they push back against a world that insists on diminishing them, and how, despite everything, they refuse to back down. It’s an ode to the power of education, to the fire that burns in those who dare to demand more, and to the kind of friendships that leave an imprint on your soul.This novel will stay with me for a long time. If you love historical fiction that is both beautifully written and deeply resonant, if you adore stories of determined women standing together in the face of adversity, then The Eights is a book you absolutely cannot miss.A huge thanks to NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP Putnam | G.P. Putnam's Sons for sharing this remarkable historical fiction's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","'You are historic figures, never forget that. The first women to matriculate at Oxford, the greatest university in the world'.It's 1920, England, the aftermath of the Great War still lingers yet it is time for celebration, Beatrice, Dora, Otto and Marianne are some of the first women to be officially enrolled at Oxford University. Allocated to the corridor 8 rooms, the women are encouraged to mingle with each other but the daily trial of navigating this male-dominated institution quickly forces them to rely on each other, 'This is not how she imagined Oxford; not as a place where women are mocked and derided for wanting to learn'. As the year progresses, it becomes clear that 'The Eights' have each brought more than a thirst for learning with them, they have secrets that might just hold them back from really achieving.'The Eights' is an enjoyable story that imagines how the first, matriculated, women students got on at Oxford. The book not only focuses on the strength of female friendship, forged in a male-dominated and somewhat unwelcoming environment but it also highlights the ongoing effects of WW1 on both the town, country and its citizens. I enjoyed Miller's use of mixed media to highlight some of the college rules and articles about lady students to give a greater depth of context. I did find it hard, at times, to keep track of who each character was and what their background story was. However, Miller's endnotes are robust, giving a guide on her research process as well as the many ways a reader can dive deeper into this topic.'We don't have to prove we deserve to be here anymore. We just have to get on with living'."
The Book Club for Troublesome Women,Marie Bostwick,4.14,"My Reviews Can Also Be Found On: The Book Review Crew BlogThis novel brings together a group of unhappy women in the 1960s and start a book club. The story unfolds very slowly, allowing you to become invested in the struggles these women face. I loved the newcomer, Charlotte, who is having some setbacks in her life. So, she decides to join the book club. It's here where the ladies learn to find a source of strength and friendship. The club consists of a very diverse group of women. Margaret, Viv and Bitsy are all dealing with their unique issues. The author has crafted a diverse group of women, so their first meeting doesn't go as smoothly as planned. But as they learn about themselves and each other, a bond begins to form. I love books about women helping women so much. I also loved that the story shows how books can start a conversation and help us while we are trying to get through difficult times, and these women use this book club as a support system of sorts.This is more than the typical story of a book club. It's a book about women finding their inner strength, getting support from each other and the power of female friendships. It was heartwarming and insightful, and it proves that sharing stories can be healing. It's the perfect read for anyone who loves books about books.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.","What must it feel like to be like that, a woman who wasn’t afraid to make demands or stir up trouble?
I really wish I could say I liked this book more than I did. The premise is great-- a perfect antidote to tradwife nonsense --but the story itself is inconsistent, both in terms of pacing and characterization.The Book Club for Troublesome Women is set in 1963, shortly after the publication of The Feminine Mystique. A group of suburban housewives in Virginia start a book club and their first pick is Friedan's new release: a decision that will change all of their lives. Moving through the perspectives of these women-- Margaret, Viv, Bitsy and Charlotte --Bostwick explores this very specific time and place. She covers the weird post-war housewife fixation and propaganda in America, showing how emerging consumerism benefitted from encouraging this as a ""natural"" role for middle class women because it sold household appliances. We see the invisible labour carried out by women, how challenging it could be to have and keep a career, and how many housewives turned to prescription drugs to cope with their six kids and stagnant lives (literally Mother's Little Helper.) In 1963, married women couldn't open a bank account without their husband's permission (even if the money going into it was their own wage), couldn't be prescribed the pill without his signature. It was stifling just reading about it.I also really appreciated that Bostwick acknowledged the limitations of Friedan's work. As Viv notes, her book primarily applies to middle class women with choices, whereas many other women, and men, were forced to work jobs they hated just to feed their kids.But while all this is great, these positives are all about the message of the book and the takeaways from Betty Friedan's writing. What actually unfolded in the story was... not that much. Especially when compared to the length of the book. There were quite a lot of slow spots, good bits interspersed with more tedious stretches. Also, I know women faced a lot of difficulties at this time, but I was disappointed that we didn't see much in the way of the promised ""troublesome women."" Only Charlotte really caused any trouble (and that was thanks to her brilliant daughter). It was frustrating that Bitsy and Margaret's lives only really changed as a result of their husbands' decisions; they themselves did not actually make much trouble. There was a lot of tongue-biting and easy forgiveness, and while I appreciate character growth, I did not fully buy Walt's about-turn.Still, I read it all and made a bunch of notes, so obviously not a bad read. Charlotte's story was by far the most satisfying.","This story had such an impact on me I started reading Virginia Woolf.In Virginia, in the early 60s, four women start a bookclub where they read a feminist book, The Feminine Mystique, that would change their lives forever. Through their conversations, they realize they aren’t the only married women with children who feel they are still not satisfied. They want to have independence, something of their own, but they feel guilty about wanting more. Their husbands don’t understand why they can’t be happy with the life they provide, and they also don’t have a clue of what went wrong, but they are determined to figure it out. When I read the blurb (the author did a better job at it than me), I didn’t hesitate to request it. I felt it was written for me: friendships, the 60s, a bookclub, a novel changing their lives…When I read the author's note that her mother read the same book, The Feminine Mystique, and changed her life, I got even more excited. It didn’t disappoint. The Bookclub for Troublesome Women is one of those books that captures you from the second you start reading. Despite not being married and not having children, I understood the desperation of the women narrating the story. They love their children and husbands (at least, the ones who had good husbands), but they never feel fulfilled. Every year, they turn more miserable because they don't understand why it isn’t enough for them, why they dream about that time when they were students or had a job outside their houses. And they feel guilty for not appreciating what they have, but they can’t help wanting something more. 

 Margaret climbed the stairs and slammed the bedroom door, feeling furious but also foolish. And yes, small. Lonely and small and less. Just less. 

I was afraid I was going to get bored of following four women for an entire book, but I quickly realized it wasn’t going to be the case. At 40%, I still felt I was beginning to get to know all the amazing women who protagonize this wonderful story. I was obsessed with them. I enjoyed how their situations were different but they were all experiencing the same feelings, and that’s how they went from neighbours to best friends-and with the help of good books, of course. I loved reading this book. It made me want to live in it forever, pick up hundreds of historical fiction books, start reading classics (I read Virginia Woolf after this, which I never thought I would do)... Then the ending happened, and I would lie if I didn’t say it spoiled the book a bit for me. The problem with the ending was that it was too perfect for a historical book that aimed to show a real historical situation. During the first half of the book, the story feels real. But then, everyone starts to get exactly what they deserve, and everything starts to be solved way too perfectly. I went from seeing this as an accurate statement of a historical situation to seeing it as what it was: a fictional book. I was going to give it 5-stars; I was so angry at the ending I wanted to scream. But a couple weeks have passed since I finished this and I’m back at appreciating everything this book gave me: the inspiration to stand out of my comfort zone and read classics, feminist non-fiction and historical fiction, four characters that stole my heart and a very enjoyable reading experience. 

In a lot of ways, her husband was just as trapped as she was. The invisible fence of rules and mores that confined women to a small, carefully defined patch of human achievement impacted men as well, required them to carry the bulk of a family’s financial burden.

Overall, I would have changed the HEA for a more realistic ending I could believe in, but I loved everything else about this book. If the premise interests you half as much as it interested me, you’re going to enjoy this story. You’ll fall in love with the four friends-and with Viv’s husband, the man was so dreamy he only needed one scene to charm me forever-, and you’ll cheer for them to follow their dreams. This book changed me, pushing me to read out of my comfort zone (which I ended up enjoying and made me want more), and I’ll be forever grateful for that. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
When the Tides Held the Moon,Venessa Vida Kelley,4.38,"A metal worker from Puerto Rico builds a big ol’ fish tank for a sideshow’s merman in this, a book that made me cry several times. The merman is grumpy (which is understandable, as he’s been fish-napped) and the metal worker is constantly facing ethical conundrums except not really because his moral compass is pretty true. The band of misfits on Coney Island is as accurate a depiction of found family as I’ve ever read, certainly, and they made me cry too so sure, just call it a sob fest I’m a big crying baby for the merman book and you will be too and if you’re not, that’s like, on you. Then the metal worker and the merman fall in love and I was extremely concerned about how they were going to make it work, given the difference in backgrounds and oxygen processing, but have some faith. Death cannot stop true love and neither can societal norms. I love you, merman book.","This was really good 😭Rating: 4 ⭐️This book has such an amazing aesthetic. It is 1910s New York, with circus performers and mermen. I love it so much. And there are pictures. Certain important scenes are illustrated and it's amazing! This story follows Benigno who, permanently down-on-his-luck being a queer Puerto Rican immigrant in the 1910s, finds himself embroiled in a scheme to capture a mermaid. Along with a circus troop, they find and capture a merman who is slated to become his very own attraction. Now imprisoned in a tank of Benigno's own making, Río and Benigno form an unlikely friendship and something... more? More so than anything else, this book is about finding home. A place where you belong. These performers have created a family that is less about what you look like or who you love, and more about who you are. Now, it wasn't perfect. There were definitely parts that frustrated me. While for valid reasons, Benigno was afraid to take action to protect himself and others and it made me want to shake him sometimes and say ""you gotta do something, man! Time's a wastin'!"" But I did really love him. Such a sweet, lost character just trying to find his way home.Overall, When the Tides Held the Moon was a delightful read. It took me a little while to get into it at the start, but once I was in it, I was in it. The book started to fly by. I would recommend it to anyone who loves mermaids, found family, or queer romance 💘 Put it in your TBR!!

Audition,Katie Kitamura,3.40,"A frustrating, high-concept piece of writing. It was beautifully-written and I appreciate it was clever, but it was not my cup of tea.I was unfamiliar with Kitamura’s work going into this, which was likely an error on my part. Had I known the author typically writes abstract, postmodern stories, I wouldn’t have mistook the premise for something I would enjoy.In Audition, the narrator is an actress, currently in a play of two very different Acts, struggling to figure out how to play a transitional scene that bridges the two. In true meta fashion, the book itself also consists of two very different parts with Part 1 teasing an important scene, one we never get to see and is completely unmentioned in Part 2.As noted above, the writing is quite beautiful, and the narrator provides us with with some interesting commentary on race in theatre, as well as on being a mother/childless. But this is one of those literary novels that forces you to ask many questions, yet the answers remain elusive after the final page.I was contemplating giving it three stars for being quite clever, but the last fifty pages just went completely off the rails. Up until that point, I had felt I somewhat understood the novel structurally and thematically, even if I did not necessarily enjoy it, but then the narrative dissolved into what, in parts, read like random chaos.In the end, I was left thinking that this is one of those books so abstract that I think you could say it means literally anything, ""oh, this symbolises this"" and ""this is a metaphor for that"", so very deep, but books like this exhaust and frustrate me. I don't personally think it's clever to make a mess and wait for others to see art in it.Don't get me wrong, there are certainly readers for this book. In fact, it is every Literature student’s wet dream— abstract, subjective, meta, and rooted in the heart of western literature: theatre.Hence why I wasn't a Lit student.I’ll also be glad when this trend of not using speech marks is over. I don’t know which hipster made this the “literary” thing, but it’s trite at this point. Even the other book I am currently reading is the same (Old Soul).",everybody needs to read this book immediately. i don't want to talk about anything else.(review to come / thank you to the publisher for the arc),"Kitamura won’t let me go; the absence that her characters carry around are loaded with substance. AUDITION, like all her novels, asks the reader to accept the unraveling mystery at the narrative sweet spot--where it splits into two opposing circumstances that would be factually impossible, except this is fiction. And it is a device that works, it worked for me. On the other hand, don’t grab too tightly—handle with care, don’t try to control the narrative, just let it be, accede to the inherent contradictions, and don’t expect a bow to tie this up with, it’s not a fairytale.I was a stage actor for a time in Austin (nothing big, nothing fancy)—so I do understand the unnamed female protagonist’s ongoing and new conundrums when attempting to flesh out her character. Even though she’s unreliable, she does have true feelings. She’s a stage and film actor, currently in a play. There’s a specific threshold or liminal place in the script, where she tells us that she is compelled to show the audience a major epiphany or transformational turn her character has reached. It may be the most important moment of the play for the actress’s part, at least thus far. The reader doesn’t know the play or the significant juncture, yet Kitamura keeps us fastened and tightly wound around it, as if we knew every line. Kitamura, subtly dazzling and lucent, does that so fluidly.I said fluidly, not to be confused with fluently. I mean, there are time jumps, some that are almost spastic--- they move with a sharp jiggle. Just go with it. I interpret it as someone whose work life merges with personal life on occasion. Which is the true version and which is the alternate? I think it could be the million-dollar question for a plot-driven story. But this author leans more on theme and character, and playing with two different realities gives us the character and the actor. No wonder she is unnamed!Language is Katie Kitamura’s magic wand. She knows how to lead or follow with it. Wherever a word or space puts or relieves pressure, she is sure to act. I never even mentioned the actor’s husband, Tomas (a writer) and the other male protagonist, Xavier, but there’s not much I want to say—readers will discover how her play plays into her personal life, and how her personal life plays into the play. Just note that you will either be distracted or driven by the narrator’s two lives. Maybe both.Sentence by sentence, I was mesmerized. Kitamura’s novels are electrically charged with questions about identity. Here—is our character a wife-mother-actor? A wife-actor? In the twenty-first century, literary novels often ask the reader to examine a person’s identity, and how it is relevant to the story. Identity in AUDITION is the recurrent question with a circumspect answer. The author is restrained in her text, her prose spare but exacting. However, certain questions must be answered in the abstract. “…I thought that it was true that a performance existed in the space between the work and the audience, that it existed, and was made, in that space of interpretation.”Another stunner from Kitamura. Thank you dearly to Riverhead and NetGalley for sending me a copy for review."
Voice of the Ocean,Kelsey Impicciche,3.94,"Voice of the Ocean is my debut novel and a fantasy retelling of the fairytale I loved most as a little girl: The Little Mermaid! It is a swashbuckling and coming-of-age story of magic, forbidden lovers, romance, and adventure.This book has everything!🪼 An emotional siren princess who feels as though she doesn't belong🌙 Mysterious magic and ancient lore🐶 A very good dog with plot armor🩵 A handsome and charismatic prince who keeps a lot of secrets🏴‍☠️ And a rag-tag group of loveable piratesIf you are a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, The Little Mermaid, or morally grey romantic interests you'll love this book.

Seriously, @frostbite.studios killed it! 🙌🏻 As a millennial gal who has watched The Little Mermaid roughly five thousand times, I was one hundred percent the target audience for this book. If you’re here for pirate booty 😉, you’ve come to the wrong place because this was true YA and therefore did not include spice. I really don’t think you’ll miss it though! I wouldn’t have minded a few more lingering looks or touches here and there, but I mostly thought the slow burn build up between them was very well paced. Among the Sirens, strength is valued and empathy is seen as a weakness and Celeste has always felt her feelings very deeply making her feel like an outsider among her people. They are taught to believe that all humans are evil and should not be allowed to live, but after observing Prince Raiden and his crew, dancing, smiling and generally showing their humanity, she begins to doubt that the humans are as bad as she has been lead to believe. In a moment of doubt, she chooses to save the Prince and his friend, a choice that could lead to her banishment. She is given one chance to fix her mistake and kill the Prince, but the more time they spend together, the harder her task becomes. Much like in the Disney movie, Celeste does not speak once she is on land. I was very impressed by how much I enjoyed the banter in this book, even though it was mostly one sided from the Prince. The author was able to convey a lot of emotion and meaning through Celeste’s character, even without the use of words. I am extremely impressed by this debut novel! This was incredibly well written and I’m genuinely excited to read book two. The audiobook was also exceptional! I adore Natalie Naudus! She is easily one of my favorite narrators.

When the Wolf Comes Home,Nat Cassidy,4.31,"NOT ME CRYING?? 😩 Okay this is now my favorite horror novel I've read so far this year. (I listened to an advanced audiobook version and it was fantastic, super well done.) It starts off with a bang and doesn't let up the entire time. The plot is fast-paced, emotional, scary as hell, and oftentimes laugh out loud funny. Idk how he does it. I'll never skip a Nat Cassidy book for as long as I live and neither should you.","Yer damn right I'm rating it 5 stars. I'm soooo excited for you all to read this one. If MARY was my homage to unreliable narrators / J-horror / gialli / serial killers, and NESTLINGS was my homage to 70s paranoia / vampires / potboiler thrillers, then THIS book is my homage to 80s action horror paperbacks, the kind you might pick up in an airport or a grocery store. It's a chase novel, but full of convention subversions and surprises to keep you on your toes. It's also about fathers, and about how the nature of fear changes as we age. It's a little bit Twilight Zone, a little bit Dean Koontz, a little bit FIRESTARTER, a little bit IT, a little bit Ursula K. Le Guin, a little bit TERMINATOR 2, and a lotta bit gonna melt your face off. But, y'know ... in a good way. 🐺🏠","Oh my goodness! This book scared the living daylights out of me—more than the sum of all the horrifying horror movies and books I’ve ever devoured. And it’s not because of gore, gruesome imagery, or jump scares. It’s the raw, emotional terror of the situations these characters face… the slow, creeping fear that grows deeper every time a character you’ve connected with meets a haunting end.This isn’t just a horror story—it’s about facing your own fears head-on. It triggered a level of anxiety and panic in me that I wasn't prepared for. It’s not about fictional villains or monsters under the bed; it’s about grief, trauma, feelings of inadequacy, fractured family dynamics, personal guilt, and the ugly truths we bury deep inside ourselves. It’s about those inner demons that keep us from truly living.I highly recommend reading the author’s note at the end. It will resonate with anyone who has a complicated relationship with their parents—or has encountered real-life shapeshifters. You might even be one yourself.The story begins with a young boy witnessing his father’s violent outburst—an eruption of fury that forces the boy to run away from home.Then we meet Jess, a failed actress who recently moved to LA. After rejecting a sleazy advance from her boss, she’s blacklisted from top-tier restaurants and now works the graveyard shift at a rundown diner. She’s still reeling from the death of her estranged father and struggling to open up emotionally to her mother, Cookie, who lives in senior care.One night, after accidentally stabbing herself with a junkie’s discarded needle while cleaning a vomit-covered restroom, Jess decides to head home early—thinking nothing could possibly make her night worse. But she’s wrong. As soon as she returns to her apartment, sipping a beer and googling what she might have been injected with, she hears strange sounds outside.She discovers the young boy from the opening scene and takes him in—only to hear screaming from her neighbors. That’s when she realizes two terrifying things:The boy’s father is hunting him.Something between a wild bear and a monstrous wolf is attacking people nearby.They have to run.During their frantic escape, Jess discovers the horrifying truth: the boy’s father and the monstrous creature are one and the same. And to survive, she’ll have to uncover the deeper secrets surrounding this boy she’s trying so hard to protect… if escape is even possible.Overall:This was mind-blowing—terrifying, yes, but also surprisingly emotional, introspective, and thought-provoking. I felt an unexpected connection with the author and the story’s themes.

Their Monstrous Hearts,Yiğit Turhan,3.28,"I will tell you that when I got the physical copy of this, I literally screamed! The cover is absolutely stunning isn’t it? Riccardo is a struggling writer. One day a mysterious stranger shows up at his apartment to inform him his grandmother, Perihan has passed away. He inherited her home in Milan along with her famous butterfly collection. When he arrives in Milan, he finds his grandmother’s manuscript. When the story unfolds, he finds himself transfixed on the allure. This is a slow burn horror story. At first, I was a little leery about the pace. It had some historical fiction aspects to it too. However, the last 30% gets WILD!! That ending blew me away and I NEVER SAW THAT COMING!! I loved it!

The real-time narrative follows Riccardo, a young writer with a hard deadline and writer's block in Paris, whose life takes a sudden turn when a stranger shows up with the news he has inherited his grandmother Perihan’s estate and butterfly collection. The moment he arrives at her estate, it’s clear there is a mystery to solve, and his search for answers leads him to a manuscript detailing Perihan’s mysterious, fairytale-like past. While the POV shifts between Riccardo, Perihan, and others feel jarring at times (especially as the nested story gradually takes precedence over the modern-day narrative)the storytelling remains compelling and accessible. Turhan’s ability to weave grim, imaginative fantasy with classic gothic tropes AND modern-day sleuthing kept me engaged and constantly guessing. ""Sometimes,when you find yourself in a dark place, you think you've been buried, but actually, you've been planted.""I love Riccardo's journey <3Final Recommendation: If you love dark, atmospheric tales of inheritance and buried truths, this book is well worth picking up. I hope to see more gothic fiction from Turhan in the future! I felt a real connection to Turhan's authenticity and inspiration from his own family shine through the story.Comps: This Cursed House by Del Sandeen, Fiend by Alma Katsu, Midnight Rooms by Donyae Coles","Many thanks to the author, Yigit Turhan, and Harlequin Trade Publishing for providing me with an ARC of this book. The publication date is set for April 08, 2025!I haven't read many horror books, but I was excited to try this genre. The prologue and the overall premise really intrigued me, and the cover of the book is beautiful. The first few chapters captivated me, and I was instantly hooked. However, at some point, my interest began to wane, and I slowly lost my enthusiasm for the story. Once the book is released, I plan to listen to the audiobook to see if that enhances my experience. For now, I am giving it 3 stars.Update: The audiobook didn’t help. The same issues I had with the original ARC persisted. The premise and beginning of the book are extremely intriguing, and I was instantly hooked and filled with curiosity. However, as the storyline progressed, it began to taper off and ultimately felt a bit flat for me. In my opinion, this isn’t a horror book, which is completely fine; that aspect doesn’t bother me at all. The best way to describe my experience is that it felt long-winded. I hope this book finds its audience, but unfortunately, it wasn’t for me. I would rate it 2.5 to 3 stars."
Serial Killer Games,Kate  Posey,3.67,"People have been “falling” off of roof tops all over the city. Suicides or a Serial Killer?

As always, these are my candid thoughts!","Kate Posey’s Serial Killer Games is a brilliantly twisted and darkly hilarious novel that will keep you on your toes from start to finish. The story centers around Dolores dela Cruz, a quirky, sharp-witted office worker with a strange fascination for spotting serial killers in the wild. Enter Jake, the mysterious new temp with an aura of danger, smooth charm, and those unmistakable ""strangler gloves."" Dolores is convinced she’s finally found the real deal—someone who could easily be hiding a stack of bodies somewhere beneath his polished exterior. But what starts as an amusing (albeit morbid) obsession soon evolves into an unexpectedly intense and flirtatious connection between these two characters.Posey masterfully weaves dark humor into this tense and off-kilter romance, creating a story that is as funny as it is suspenseful. Dolores and Jake's strange dynamic—a blend of mutual curiosity, playful banter, and an underlying sense of danger—keeps readers hooked. Their chemistry is undeniable, pulling you deeper into the narrative with each turn of the page. What makes the novel truly stand out is its ability to blend this unusual romance with laugh-out-loud moments while maintaining a thread of suspense that has you questioning everything.The supporting characters add another layer of richness to the story, and the office setting provides a perfect backdrop for this darkly humorous cat-and-mouse game. As the novel unfolds, you’re left wondering: is Jake truly the serial killer Dolores imagines him to be, or is their budding relationship just a dangerously fun game with no real consequences?What’s most surprising about Serial Killer Games is the emotional resonance beneath all the dark humor. Posey doesn’t just give us a macabre rom-com; she taps into the vulnerabilities of her characters, showing the complexity of human connection, trust, and how people reveal their true selves over time. Dolores and Jake’s evolving relationship is both twisted and tender, challenging expectations and delivering an oddly wholesome love story hidden beneath all the intrigue.This is a fast-paced, witty, and refreshing read for anyone who loves their rom-coms with a darker, more suspenseful edge. If you enjoy stories with eccentric characters, morbid humor, and unexpected twists, Serial Killer Games will keep you laughing, gasping, and guessing until the very last page.A huge thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this witty entertaining romance/ suspense' s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","Have you ever felt alone in the world?

Fun for the Whole Family,Jennifer E. Smith,4.12,my name is emma and my secret talent is tracking down books about siblings(review to come / thanks to the publisher for the e-arc),"My Reviews Can Also Be Found On: The Book Review Crew Blog
There’s no such thing as fun for the whole family. —Jerry Seinfeld
I loved this book, it was so realistic regarding family dynamics and even though the siblings are extraordinary I think everyone will see a bit of their family in this one. There's lots of strife and we get to see every side of every family member. I loved the format of the book each character has a chapter in the past while travelling the different states they went to with their mother on their summer trips and then we get that character’s chapter in the present. After not seeing each other for three years the four Endicott siblings—Gemma, Connor, Roddy, and Jude, plus Conner’s two kids and Roddy’s future spouse all go to Colorado for a weekend reunion. While they’re at a cabin they get stuck inside because of a snowstorm and they have no power. There are a couple of surprises sprung on the siblings while they are there and as much as I loved this book I figured out the surprises rather quickly and I found it rather anticlimatic and predictable. This was a five-star read for me until that happened. In my head, I kept thinking I bet Jude did this or Jude says that.I love a good family drama and this was a wonderfully written story of family dynamics, following your dreams and forgiving the past. The way the characters related to each other and their issues really got to my emotions. Who can't relate to being the eldest, the middle child or the baby of the family? Throughout the entire book, I kept changing who was my favourite and who I didn't like. What didn’t change for me while reading was the fact that I thought both parents (for lack of a better word) were assholes. The parents were both absent. The mother was so stuck on following her dream of being an actress that she left her children and the father was a workaholic who left the rearing of the other three to the oldest daughter and I know what that's like. Overall this was an enjoyable, entertaining read about a bunch of siblings who really love each other, flaws and all.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.","In my opinion, the book’s title could be changed to The Road Trips of the Amazing Endicotts, as it presents four siblings who follow completely different life paths, finding happiness, success, and passion in their own ways. After an emotional breakdown three years ago—coinciding with the death of their father—the siblings grew estranged. Resentments boiled over into words that couldn’t be taken back, leading to tears, screams, anger, sadness, and hurt that tore their relationships apart.Three years later, Jude, one of the youngest siblings and a movie star recently nominated for an Academy Award, sends her siblings a cryptic message, summoning them to North Dakota. This brings back memories of their troubled mother, who used to take them on road trips full of promises for adventure and fun, which sadly ended in tragedy.Gemma, the eldest sister in her early forties, lives in Chicago with her loving husband, Mateo, and works a mundane marketing job her siblings secretly belittle. She receives Jude's message in the middle of the night, feeling emotionally fragile after several miscarriages and a recent embryo transfer that may be her last chance to become a mother. For years, Gemma has taken on the role of caregiver for her siblings, replacing their troubled mother, who only visited once a year to take them on road trips while their father was constantly away for work. Now, Gemma fears turning into their emotionally unstable mother and questions whether she’s ready to raise a family of her own.Connor, an aspiring author gaining success with a novel based on his family’s past, finds himself alienated from his siblings due to his portrayal of their memories. Recently divorced and missing his two children, Rosie and Hugh, Connor spends his days in Nashville bars, drowning his sorrows as he battles a creative block. Initially hesitant to attend Jude's family meeting, his emotional turmoil eventually drives him to confront his siblings.Roddy, Jude’s twin, is engaged to his nerdy scientist boyfriend, Winston, and is on the verge of signing a new contract to play soccer with an Orlando team. However, his knee pain after several surgeries and the physical toll of aging weigh heavily on him. When his agent insists he head to Orlando earlier than planned, complicating his wedding date, Roddy grapples with how to break the news to Winston. Upon receiving Jude’s message, he realizes it's time to reconcile with his siblings and confront their differences.Though Jude appears to have a perfect life—an Oscar nomination, a movie star boyfriend named Spencer, and a bright future—she harbors many secrets that have been eating away at her. After three years of self-imposed exile from her siblings, she knows it’s time to come clean, even if it risks alienating them further.What begins as a meticulously planned reunion soon devolves into a locked-room drama when the siblings find themselves trapped in a remote cabin with no electricity or phone service. Forced to face long-buried issues, old resentments, and devastating secrets, their relationship is on the verge of being changed forever.Oh boy! This book hit me hard on so many levels! Your emotions will be all over the place by the time you finish, and if you have siblings, you’ll probably want to call them as soon as you read the last page. Get ready to cry like a baby—keep plenty of tissues nearby! This heartwarming, engaging, and emotional family saga will resonate with you more than you can imagine. It’s realistic, heartfelt, powerful, and undoubtedly one of the best fiction novels of 2025—I thoroughly enjoyed it!Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/Ballantine Books for sharing this heartwarming family drama’s digital review copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
Atmosphere,Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.46,god dammit.,"""by taylor jenkins reid"" is all i need to know","Gracias BookUp por la copia avanzada de este libro, que desde ya se vuelve de mis lecturas favoritas del 2025. Decir que no lo podía soltar se queda corto. Taylor Jenkins Reid me sorprende más y más con cada libro que saca.Además me hizo darme cuenta de lo mucho que amo los libros sobre astronautas y el espacio. He leído muy pocos, pero de esos pocos, TODOS me han encantado. Necesito más.Lo único que me hubiera gustado más de este libro sería un epílogo. Lo daría todo por un epílogo."
Blonde Dust,Tatiana de Rosnay,3.88,"Really enjoy reading about Old Hollywood so when I had the opportunity to read an advanced copy of Blond Dust I jumped on it.The synopsis told me that this was the story of the fabulous Marilyn Monroe and her friendship with a first generation French woman Pauline who worked as a maid in a Reno, Nevada hotel.I ate this book up.  It took me behind the glamour and glitz of a real Hollywood mega star.  She literally stripped Marilyn of all her outer glamour… her makeup, expensive perfume and fabulous clothing.  De Rosnay also exposed Marilyn's huge heart.Other than a terrific storyline there is nothing I appreciate more than great character development.  The character Pauline had a complicated and well developed back story.Basically this is tale of how one individual's care and consideration of another can change a life.If I had studied the cover prior to jumping into my reading I might have been clued into the fact that horses were somehow involved in this novel.  I was quite taken with the telling of the story of wild mustang horses of the western United States.  De Rosnay portrayed the majestic animals so beautifully.  If you love animals and horses in particular here is another reason to pick up this book.  My heart warmed to the story of the wild Mustangs with one in particular actually becoming a key character in the novel.It looks like I will look into the author's catalog to discover what else she has written.  Perhaps I will try her historical fiction piece, Sarah's Key written in 2008.Sending thanks out to the author Tatiana de Rosnay, her publisher Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this advanced copy of Blonde Dust.","I would rate this 3 1/2 stars. It's a well-written historical fiction novel about Marilyn Monroe when she was filming The Misfits in Reno, NV. It highlights a fictional friendship with a maid at the hotel where she was staying. I enjoy all of this author's books, & this one is no exception. Thank you to Edelweiss+ for the digital ARC.","While BLONDE DUST had a very engaging premise, and I was very thankful to have received an ARC (ebook & physical copy), this book was just not for me. The writing style was hard for me to follow, and at times I got lost regarding who was talking and whose point of view it was from. I think this book was a great idea and a great story, but the way it was done didn't work for me."
Riding the High,Paisley Hope,4.31,"2 starsLately, all of my recent reads have been so underwhelming that I honestly can’t tell if Riding the High was a bad book, or if I’m just stuck in a terrible reading slump. I went into this one with low expectations after struggling through the first two books in the series, hoping that maybe, just maybe, this one would turn things around. After all, Cole and Ginger’s dynamic seemed promising enough to keep me going. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I just didn’t enjoy it. At this point, I’m not sure if it was the book’s fault or if I was just in the wrong headspace, but either way, it didn’t work for me.The premise had a lot of potential: a small-town sheriff and the daughter of a congressman who accidentally get married after a wild weekend in Vegas. What’s not to love? They decide to keep their marriage a secret until their personal and professional lives settle down. As Ginger agrees to help Cole with his daughter that summer, their accidental marriage starts to feel more real. It could’ve been a cute, swoon-worthy romance with all the right ingredients, but somehow, it just didn’t hit the mark.Instead, it felt like the plot dragged on without ever picking up momentum. It took me over a week to finish this book, and this is coming from someone who usually devours books in about 2-3 days. When it takes that long to get through a story that should have been quick and engaging, that’s never a good sign. Every time I picked it up, I found myself struggling to keep going. I almost wanted to dnf it several times, but I kept pushing through, hoping it would redeem itself. Unfortunately, it didn’t.The romance—Let me be clear: I don’t mind smut in my romances. In fact, I’ve been known to enjoy it! But in this case, it was like the book was more about their physical relationship than about developing any emotional depth between the characters. Every major moment seemed to revolve around Cole and Ginger hooking up, and it started to feel repetitive. It wasn’t romantic—it was just smut for the sake of smut, and it completely overshadowed any potential for emotional growth. It left the plot feeling thin, and I just couldn’t get invested in the characters or their relationship.If you’re someone who’s into steamy romances and doesn’t mind a light plot, you might find this book appealing. But for me, it just felt like the steam overtook everything else that could’ve made the story more meaningful. There wasn’t enough substance for me to connect with or care about their journey.I’ve felt the same way about the entire series. I’m definitely not a hater when it comes to cowboy romances—I actually love them! But this series just hasn’t delivered. The characters have been one-dimensional, the plots thin, and each book has left me feeling underwhelmed at best. I keep hoping for something to really grab me, but so far, nothing has.In the end, Riding the High felt like a missed opportunity. The premise was solid, and the characters had potential, but the execution didn’t work for me. If you’re looking for a romance that leans more heavily into smut than emotional depth, this might be a good fit. But if you’re after a story with true chemistry and character development, I’d say skip this one. I might pick up the next book in the series when it releases, but it won’t be out of excitement—more out of curiosity or if I’m just in the mood for something light and steamy.All in all, I was left disappointed. It just didn’t resonate with me, and unfortunately, the whole series so far has been a bit of a letdown. Thank you Penguin Random House Australia for the arc.","╰┈➤ 5 stars!riding the high by paisley hope felt as if i was riding the high on my own! this story was so good! it was full of support, love, and friendship. there's just something about small-town romance books that just captivates me.living in a small-town where everyone is close to one another, having a big family who are tight, and just the place itself makes me wanna escape the city and live my life in a town where everyone is not in a hurry.౨ৎ ginger. a woman who refuses to let her parents dictate her life, especially when it comes to their demands for her to find a husband and have children. she’s fierce, independent, and doesn't back down from a fight. her love for kids shines through, making her an incredible caregiver and role model. she’s sassy, confident, and isn’t afraid to speak her mind, which makes her character even more lovable. most importantly, she’s the mother who stepped up when others couldn’t—a true embodiment of strength and resilience.౨ৎ cole. the ultimate single dad who carries an enormous weight on his shoulders. despite his many responsibilities, he manages to be an amazing father to mabel. and can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he has a “G” tattoo that stands for ginger? if that’s not peak devotion, i don’t know what is. plus, the fact that he buys flowers for mabel’s room every time she’s away just so the house doesn’t feel empty—ugh, my heart. cole is not only a great dad but also a man who knows how to show love in the most thoughtful and meaningful ways.the banter between ginger and cole? absolutely top-tier. it keeps the spark in their relationship alive and makes their dynamic so entertaining. the way they challenge and tease each other adds so much depth to their connection. and let’s not forget the ashby men—they’re the perfect balance of protective and respectful. they know when to step in and defend their women, but they also understand when to give them space and let them handle things on their own. it’s such a refreshing dynamic that adds a lot of charm to the story.cole being a total girl dad just melts my heart even more. his bond with mabel is so pure and wholesome, and you can really feel the love he has for her. overall, this book was an emotional rollercoaster with the perfect mix of spice, humor, and heartfelt moments. it’s definitely one that sticks with you long after you’ve finished reading.Thank you to NetGalley, Random House Publishing, and the author for the ARC in exchange of my honest review.・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・。・pre-read:been waiting for cole and ginger’s story! i just know that this will eat given that they’re already fully aware of the tension between them but just not making a move 🤭👀 i’m so glad my request for the arc got approved 💌",ℝ𝕒𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘- ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ ╰┈➤ 3.5 rounded up.

The Tenant,Freida McFadden,3.90,"What in the Limonene!!??... huh!??... EXACTLY! Freida never sleeps McFadden is back again with her newest release The Tenant. In this book we are following Blake who has been fired from his job and is struggling to make ends meet with his fiancé Krista. They both decide that they need to welcome in a roommate to help with paying the rent in their Brownstone home. Here comes Whitney. She is bright, spunky and beautiful. The perfect fit right!? Well, when the neighbours start acting funny towards Blake, there are bump bump noises in the night and Blake feels like his secrets are about to be exposed. Has he just allowed the wrong one into his home? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂It’s got to the point now where I have learned not to expect too much from Freida. I mean she is releasing more books than there are Bank holidays and with the thriller genre there is only so many plots and tropes that can be used to entertain your audience… I guess.PART ONEPart one of the book started of interesting and it was nice reading about a couple who were not completely idiotic and were trying to find means to help their dire situation. With that said that doesn’t mean I found them likeable or entertaining either. Blake’s constant whining was giving me the major ICK and I really wanted to put him on mute. I found Krista to also be an irritant and she just felt like an inconvenience character being there for there sakes. The switch up with the roommate Whitney gave me whiplash and felt all too sudden but hey o it kept the story moving…I guess. YOU KNOW WHAT DIDN’T KEEP THE STORY MOVING?....A whole two chapters dedicated to a damn Goldfish! Now listen I know Goldy was mentioned here and there and was the unit keeping that little family afloat (get it😏) but TWO freaking whole chapter’s solely speaking about a fish is WILD! Limonene. One thing Freida will always do is introduce you to a word you might not be familiar with and never let you hear the end of it. My goodness the constant mention of it has me now thinking I have an allergy against it too.The back and forth with Blake and Whitney had its entertaining moments but also felt like a drag. I have read this scenario SO MANY TIMES… I get it… Lets move on. THE TWIST And so, we reach part two and we get our twist. Ok Freida, touché you are remaining in your traditional formulaic ways … Fine, I’ll remain interested… now tell me more. ACTUALLY DON’T. Because when I was giving the Why, Where, How and Now of it all I was absolutely flabbergasted. The convenience of it all is absolutely laughable. I FEAR FREIDA HAS RUN OUT OF TRICKS AND TWISTS IN HER THRILLER BAGIt just didn’t make no sense. No scrap that. It just wasn’t warranted. I rolled my eyes at the absurdity and silliness of it all. This plot has been done before, and I wanted something new and exciting. The whole book after part two was just pure ridiculousness and had bouts of unnecessary fillers when ultimately it was evident how it was all going to end. So with everything said, I will say that I did enjoy it more than her two previous releases and it was more digestible. No, it wasn’t an absolute phenomenon, but it was a quick read and gave me some chuckling moments. THE EPILOGUEShould’ve just stayed in the drafts. 2.5 ⭐------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩FREIDA JUST STOP ALREADYY!!!!
*proceeds to add to ‘currently reading’*
 😭😭😭",the devil works hard but freida works harder,"I’ll start by saying I personally think this is one of her better recent books—definitely an improvement over the last couple.Not a top favorite, but still enjoyable enough to finish. Part 1… Blake and Krista were, surprisingly, one of the more ""normal"" couples to emerge from Freida’s world—not necessarily the best or most likable, but yeah. Blake had his fair share of whining, which wore thin quickly, and Krista didn’t bring much to the table beyond her intense love for her goldfish and an almost compulsive cookie-baking habit. Whitney, on the other hand, was… intriguing, to say the least. The back-and-forth between her and Blake was entertaining at times, though it occasionally dragged. Still, things can only get more interesting from here—hopefully.Part 2… The twist is revealed. Interesting… I guess. Not exactly earth-shattering. I wanted to love the whole when-where-why-how unraveling—but let’s be honest, I didn’t. That’s the thing with the thriller genre: there are only so many plot twists and tropes you can cycle through before it starts feeling like déjà vu with slightly different characters and a fresh coat of paint. But hey, I’m still here for the pure, ridiculous entertainment of it all. Maybe one day I’ll actually be caught off guard again — a person can dream. Still, I had a good laugh. That said, we definitely could’ve cut a few chapters without losing anything crucial. They didn’t really add much to the story.And now Part 3… just a chaotic mess, honestly.Finally, we’re at the epilogue. They’re usually hit or miss anyway—this one was fine, just didn’t feel all that necessary.p.s. further exposure to limonene, fruit flies, or goldy the goldfish may result in emotional distress.⇉ 𝘐𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘶𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘳, 𝘮𝘢𝘺𝘣𝘦 𝘪𝘵’𝘭𝘭 𝘩𝘪𝘵 𝘥𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵.

Death Row,Freida McFadden,3.73,Freida? Again girl? Like go to sleep,"2.5 ⭐️ ive never been so confused by a book, that ending was just shit 😑 like what did i actually just read tbh*i received a free copy of this book from amazon first reads",FREIDA... WHEN WAS THIS!?!*here we go again... adds to want to read* 😭😭😭
The Housemaid's Secret,Freida McFadden,4.21,"In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

Twitter",So ridiculous but I devoured it 🤣,freida writes some of the goofiest unbelievable shit and i will gobble it up. i sure will.
Just for the Summer,Abby Jimenez,4.37,"5 stars!!“The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about.”
You guys do not know how excited I am to write this review because this book meant so much to me and I honestly didnt think a book could mean so much to someone until I read this 🥺 It was so beautifully written, with such emotion, Only one book has managed to make me cry (As long as the lemon trees grow"") while this one did not make me sob, It brought me so close to it when I read the epilogue because it was perfect 🙂‍↕️✋🏻 I could have binged this book in one sitting because I was literally free but I was so attached to these characters that I was delaying an inevitable goodbye which hit me so hard because within a span of 400 pages, they gave me so much and took it all away as I closed the book 😔✋🏻 Reading this book was such a serene experience, makes me want to read every Abby book out there because this was fucking beautiful. I have never in my life read a book filled with so much feeling, such perfect representation of guilt, self-hate, anxiety and neglect as this 😮‍💨This book perfectly captures gut-wrenching moments mixed with feel-good, heartfelt moments, written with so much emotion that it honestly felt like I was experiencing all this in real life with them with me because there is no way a book can have me on the verge of tears imagining them sitting together as they laugh and live a happy life or make me feel so angry at a character for treating her daughter so bad and I can not stress on how the slow burn made me feel AHHH!! I wanted everything and it eventually gave me everything 😭. The writing was simply breathtaking, it reminded me so much of Emily Henry because usually her books are the type to make me feel this way. The way it described love is gonna make you believe in it 🩷I feel like another way to look at why this book is so perfect for us is because we had unbelievably high expectations like you do not know how high are expectations were, we singlehandedly believed that this would be our summer read and the anticipation that led to this book because were waiting to read it in June but my copy took a month to arrive and then one thing led to another and before we knew it, and we learned that you need to read the first two books (not true, this could be read as a stand alone) 😭😭 but for a better experience we did and we really enjoyed these two but they can not be compared to this masterpiece. It was everything, it managed to exceed everyone of our expectations and we loved every second of it 😌 This showed how good of a book this was.The characters in this book were so fucking precious 🥹. I wanted hug all of them because they all deserved so much better than what they got, We follow two characters Emma and Justin who meet over a twitter thread and having similar relationship problems enter a fling 'Just for the summer' and one thing leads to another and to know more you would have to read this book because so much happens and I am still stuck in those moments 😔😮‍💨✋🏻
“You're not asking too much,"" he said. ""You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”
Justin was the epitome of 'If he wanted to he would' because he did!! 😌 I love how good Abby Jimenez's men are. All of them are literally green flags. He was everything that you would look for a man. That man was the standard because no one has ever put themselves out that much for anyone, he was fully committed, the way he comforted and understood Emma's trauma and pain and tried to give her time and be there for her was so precious for me because this should be the bare minimum tbh these days, he did all this while struggling himself with his mom going to jail and him having to take care of his family, all of it put together complimented the book well.I mean how can you not love him, he's 6ft, charming, charismatic, funny and has dimples + is a software engineer and uses his skills to make fun things for his gf 🤭. I love, love, loved the effort that he put into this relationship and I also love the found family aspect that we got because of him, this whole series tying up to this moment felt like a massive found family and I was in love with it.
“In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy,”
Emma was such a strong character tbh because it's so hard to find books without any annoying female characters and I was so happy when I found Emma to be so realistic and relatable 😭 I wont agree with anyone saying Emma didn't deal with anything in a mature way-✋🏻 Live with a mother who abandons you and neglects you and then judge her✋🏻. Emma was so cute, I loved her and I literally grew so close to her and so fond of her that everything that came rolling down on her made me so sad and angry. I loved the way her character looked at the world, where she would look at things with more empathy and would encourage people to do that as well. People like her are a gem and should be protected at all costs 🩷I hated Emma's mother sm 😡 she made me furious because what she did was unforgivable!! to think that Emma could have gotten so much love and such a nice past- but she didn't because Amber the fucking bitch was to selfish to do that, she would abandon her and ruin her life, would make her feel like shit and would not care for her or more or less pay attention to her 💔 Especially chapter 41 where she talks to him (yk who) and he tells her about his past and she thinks that's it could've been for her.
“Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”
Maddy is the friend we alll want and I am so happy and thankful to god for giving me friends like her because she was perfect. She understood Emma so well, gave her reality checks and supported her, helped Justin figure her out and overall I just loved how she was there for her always. I also loved Emma's relationship with Justin's brother and I liked how Justin and Emma rekindled because of them<333
“What are you thinking?” I asked. He didn’t answer for a long moment. When he did, he did it with his eyes closed. “All I ever think about is you.”
The romance was everything that I ever wanted. It was everything. I loved it so much that I literally have no words to describe it, it made me feel every emotion that is out there to exist 🥹 Justin and Emma were made for each other, it was everything that I was looking for in a moment, there banter alone was so well done and their chemistry was perfect tbh. Their domestic scenes had me swooning 😮‍💨 where they would cook together and help the kids and I loved how she would just extend her trip. That first kiss scene literally gave me and Emma both butterflies, it was so well done. Although it's supposed to be a fling but there's so much slow burn and angst and tension filled in this book 🥵 The perfect balance of everything. Like its the perfect fucking combo for everyone out there. I genuinely would read it every year/ every summer.Scenes that I absolutely loved:1, Justin making Emma pre-date questionnaires and giving her invitations 🤭2, the whole toilet king banter 😭✋🏻3, Dual pov 🙂‍↕️4, The confrontation between Emma and her mother 🥺5, Chapter 40 😨6, Justin paddle boating his way through to get on an island just because Emma called him and told him that she was sick 🥹7, The airport hotel scene between Maddy and Emma 🫂8, Sarah emergency contact list scene + JustinEmma domestic scenes 🩷9, Justin and Emma on the date where Leigh and his mom crash with them 🤣10, the first and the last chapter 🩷🫂
“The moment Emma came into view, my entire world slipped into slow motion. My brain took a screenshot. I felt the moment freeze and save. She was beautiful.”
The plot (Spoilers will be mentioned) started off so cute with the whole fling and it served well for their banter and chemistry and I was excited to see where all of it would go tbh because I wanted to see how all of it would end and oh my god that plot twist that came and hit us?? like me and Roxy were shooketh like we could have figured this out so fast but we were so blind like we were actually so blind and Jimenez did such a mega job keeping us distracted with Justin and Emma that we didnt even figure out the elephant in the room SPOILERS umm chapter 40?? Daniel and Emma being siblings?? I felt so bad for her when Daniel and her talked and Amber was litr mentioned + Neil was right there HOW did we not notice him LMAOO. anyways I liked how Daniel and Emma got their good moments and she had a better life and found someone to love just because of a summer fling SPOILERS ENDOverall, an amazing read!! I went in with extremely high expectations and read every single word there was to read!! Would definitely recommend!Some of the quotes that I loved; 
“The love stories sold us the wrong thing. The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about. Taking the end piece of the bread at breakfast so she can have the last middle piece for her sandwich when you pack her lunch. Making sure her car always has gas so she never has to stop at the pump. Telling her you’re not cold and to take your jacket when you are in fact, very, very cold. It’s watching TV on a rainy Sunday while you’re doing laundry and turning her light off when she’s fallen asleep reading. Sharing pizza crusts and laughing about something the kids did and taking care of each other when you’re sick. It isn’t glamorous, it isn’t all butterflies and stars in your eyes. It’s real. This is the kind of love that forever is made of. Because if it’s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the love songs are playing and the moon is out.”.“Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.”.“Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”.“Sometimes I feel like the seasons could come and go and come and go, a hundred years could pass, a thousand, the ground could collapse under us, this house could crumble and go back to the earth, and we would still be standing here frozen in time, because every second I’m with you is eternal. I’ve never felt anything like it.”.“Because when you’re in love, you do hard things.”.“I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”.“To me, love meant you stayed. But now I understood that love sometimes means you let someone go.”.“This is the thing nobody tells you about The One. How they’re timeless. How the moment they pop up again you’re right back in it, right where you left off.”.“Tell me your day today from start to finish.”

This book fucking ruined me
Easily my favourite book of the year 😭 ___In Roxy's wise words ""This better be revolutionary‼️""•Buddy reading with Roxy__Please, please, please be THE summer romance book. I have invested a lot in you! 😤","Oh boy! Too many words come to mind at once, creating a huge cacophony. They're not enough to express how much I loved this book. Great, brilliant, adorable words aren't doing justice for this most poignant book, and even the best couple and best book boyfriend (OMG: don’t you think Justin is like cinnamon rolls meets mud pie? This character completely changed my perspective about the name, although I still think both Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake are rubbing me the wrong way) created by Abby Jimenez.I used to think “Part of Your World” was her best work, but “Just for the Summer” exceeded it with Toilet King references, fantastic dating options, so many ugly cries, and sweetest, sighing, swoon-smile-repeat moments blended in heavy triggering subjects that are handled with care and in a realistic way, including PTSD, panic attacks, death, child neglect, dysfunctional family, and mental health issues.The witty and sweet dialogues, catchy banters, physical attraction, and emotional intimacy, along with the perfect chemistry between Emma and Justin, are pure perfection! Even though they met through a Reddit thread that turned into humorous messages and sweet phone calls during the hardest times of their lives, their blooming friendship and curse-breaking designated dates—including four dates, one kiss, and a breakup—are a scenario doomed to fail when the attraction hits the roof.Another best part of the book is seeing cameos from the “Part of Your World” universe. Seeing those favorite characters in this book made me smile a lot.Let’s take a closer look at the plot:The book opens with a laugh-out-loud “Am I the asshole?” Reddit thread written by Justin, a cute, caring 29-year-old engineer who sees his situation as a good luck charm, meaning each woman he dates finds their significant other immediately after their breakup, and they even invite him to their weddings.Emma, a 28-year-old traveling nurse, reads this thread during her lunch break with her bestie Maddie, and she decides to DM the guy because she’s also the good luck charm that every man she dates marries immediately after the breakup. Justin decides to write her back, which turns into very entertaining correspondences. A few days later, they start talking on the phone, and eventually Justin comes up with an interesting offer: if they date each other and break up, they can also break the curse and have a chance to find their soulmates. Emma finds this plan unreasonable at first. She and Maddy had already decided to fly to Hawaii for their rest residence, but as long as she spends more time with Justin on the phone, she decides to change her plans and rent a cozy cottage in Minnesota for only six weeks to help her realize their date plan.She even plays the guilt card to convince Maddy. The plan is simple: they’ll date only for a few weeks, kiss each other goodbye, and ride off into the sunset with their own future soulmates. But when sparks start flying around them and their first meeting turns into being hit by a love truck, the detailed plans, which included more surveys and questionnaires, are fated to fail. Especially when both of them struggle with unexpected mommy-related family issues, which push them toward each other, and Emma, who resists taking people into her heart, finds herself letting not only Justin but his entire family in. Could she learn to set roots somewhere? Could she learn to dissect the barriers to make herself small and open her heart fully to love and be cherished in return?Overall: three words, “I loved it,” and two more words, “read it”! This is one of the best romance novels of the year, and don’t you dare miss it!Oh boy, I couldn’t tell you how much I appreciate this digital reviewer copy I received and how thankful I am to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for sending me this ARC copy in exchange for my honest review. And thanks a lot to Abby Jimenez for writing this book, lighting up my mood, making me laugh till my stomach aches, and making me cry till I had the best raccoon makeup.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<","Reading this book was such an exhausting experience.

There were no feelings to it, I surely did not feel a single thing reading it. The plot execution was so messy and had no direction.  The romance was very mid.  The two characters start off okay but then their personalities clash. The chemistry is meh. They do have some cute moments but I could not feel a single thing for them. Justin and Emma have issues of their own but Justin deals with things a tad more maturely compared to Emma. Sure, I feel bad for Emma but the way her story and character was written is just  so damn boring.  Justin's siblings were more cute and I would rather read about them than this tiresome book. I skimmed it towards the end and have no regrets. I realize that it's probably just me who didn't like it but please go in with low expectations. Also, what is the purpose of marketing it as a standalone if we have to read her other books first in order to start liking it?!~•~•~Found family? Forced proximity? Summer fling? Online meet cute? SO EXCITEDDD to start with it!!! ^_^"
One Golden Summer,Carley Fortune,4.44,4.5 ⭐️ this was a TREAT.,"SO. GOOD. 👏🏼👏🏼 dare i say this is her best yet???? bc it is for me!!!! look no further bc your perfect summer romcom has arrived!!! 📖🐚🌊😩💘🙌🏼🔥this is the companion novel to EVERY SUMMER AFTER and we get Charlie’s story (the bad bro… iykyk) but also get cameos of Sam & Percy and go back to the iconic setting of Barry’s Bay. read if you like: lake settings, forced proximity tropes, good banter, teenage nostalgia, bucket lists, friends to lovers, family themesCarley’s novels have been quite hit or miss for me over the years but i’m happy to report she is SO back with this. despite enjoying it, i had quite mixed feelings with EVERY SUMMER AFTER (her debut) bc it was so similar to LOVE & OTHER WORDS. but, i was excited to go back to the Barry’s Bay setting and check it out. i couldn’t put this down and finished in 24 hours—it was the most perfect beach binge for my trip. it was SO GOOD. reminded me so much of the classic EmHen banter we all know and love. i was eager to see how Charlie’s story would unfold and see if he’d redeem himself and i getttt it 👀 he was a major flirt and i loved “watching” him & Alice have a fun summer in Barry’s Bay (love a lake setting so much). one or two things prevented this from being perfect for me but overall, i HIGHLY recommend it!idk how to explain but it gave me THE SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY vibes? not w the brothers or anything but the setting and teenage nostalgia on the lake was everything. i truly felt a part of this story and her writing talent w that is unreal. this is also prob one of the most well done executions of the forced proximity plot i’ve seen. and this cover??!!?! rufkm! perfection!!!!a few things:📖 yes i think it’s important to read EVERY SUMMER AFTER before this or else spoilers galore🌊 we are back at Barry’s Bay and the author once again does such a good job of making you truly feel like you’re there🐚 the summertime, young adult, feelin like you’re 17 again nostalgia in this was done SO well🥹 i was actually loling as i read. when i say romcom, heavy on the comedy! their banter is everything 🙃 the major twist was predictable for me but i can see it being a shock to readers if you aren’t paying close attention!🎬 EVERY SUMMER AFTER is being adapted via Prime Video right now and if it’s a hit, i’d be shocked if we don’t get a spinoff of this one. and now i NEEEEED to see who they cast as Charlie… 🔥","Carley's stories have progressively gotten worse with each one I read - why do her covers always have to be so damn gorgeous ... always pulling me in.Also - Charlie's story?? Might have some time for that. 🤭Oh damn, this one's out - gotta get to it soon!"
The Perfect Divorce,Jeneva Rose,4.10,"JENEVA, BABE THERE BETTER NOT BE A TRILOGY…A Perfect Divorce is the sequel to a A Perfect Marriage and we are back following Sarah Morgan 11 years later where she is now married to Bob Miller and has a child. Unfortunately, the cheating bug seems to follow Sarah as she catches Bob having a one-night stand. She immediately files for divorce. But she has bigger fish to fry because new DNA evidence has been uncovered against her ex-husband throwing her back into the spotlight and when the woman that Bob slept with is found missing both are at the front centre of her disappearance. Let me just be completely honest. This sequel was not needed! Not only did I have to wait till 40% in the book to actually become somewhat interested but there was a whole bunch of cat and mouse that was lacking serious electric energy. Sarah is still Sarah and Bob is Bob! No character development just two entitled fools who think they are above the law… SNOOOZE!The was some funny dialogue in certain parts and I am a lover of short chapters so that was a win. But in terms of the whole plot and some anticipated “twist and turns” … PLEASE BEHAVE! As an obvious Popcorn Thriller, I can accept embellished and extreme over the top shenanigans and twists but the ones in this book were sooo ‘MEH’There was a scene that I think the author thought we was going to fall for and I absolutely laughed out loud at the cliffhanger because bless you hun, you really thought you got me there…😒 Then the last ‘twist’ just had me shaking my head in disappointment. The story is told in numerous POVs that I didn’t particularly care for. It would have been enough to keep it with just Sarah, Bob and Sheriff Hudson. ⋆｡°✩WHAT I LIKED⋆｡°✩➽ Short Chapters➽ Funny dialogue ➽ The police procedural➽ Quick read⋆｡°✩WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE⋆｡°✩➽ Too much unnecessary fillers➽ Too many POVS➽ The twists were not enjoyable ➽ Eye rolling embellishment ➽ Predictable ➽ The ending Although not a banger for me, I do believe it’s a digestible book that you can get through on a lazy weekend or maybe play the audiobook (Adam Lazarre- White voices the sheriff and whewww that mans voice🥵🥵🔥) in the background as you get on with other things. 2.5 ⭐------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩Happy Pub Day!!!Cant wait to see what the characters are up to now!Hope this sequel is as funny and entertaining!🤍❤️🤍","Well hot dang!!!! The sequel outdoes The Perfect Marriage. Absolutely Exquisite. Just gripping!!!The storyline is darkly entertaining, I’m loving all the angles and I seriously could not put it down.… GET THIS ON YOUR LIST, YESTERDAY…..Better than the first one, and there’s is another one to come after this one. Can’t wait!!!!!!!!Thank you to Blackstone Publishing for an ARC in exchange for my honest review. 😊","I felt like this sequel to The Perfect Marriage was the author’s way of making amends—tidying up the mess from book one, closing the plot holes, and giving readers a more complete, satisfying experience. Good news: the police investigation this time around doesn’t feel like a clumsy crime movie spoof. It’s tighter, better structured, and far more compelling.This time, we get three intriguing mysteries that weave together smoothly: a missing one-night stand, the reopening of Kelly Summers’ murder case, and the suspicious death of a cop. The pacing is spot on—you’ll find yourself constantly turning pages, snacking away, and grinning at the twists, especially in the final third where the tension really kicks up a notch. There’s a lot going on, and you keep asking yourself, “Is karma finally coming for these people?” Thankfully, most of the foolish ones get what’s coming to them!No spoilers, but there is one lingering thread involving a mysteriously resurfacing character that seems to hint at another sequel. If I could name it? The Perfect Funeral. It just fits this twisted little universe so well, right?The book opens with Sarah Morgan—yes, she’s back—being cheated on again. She’s filing for divorce, demanding custody of her daughter Summer, while her husband Bob pleads that it was just a “one-time thing.” (Seriously, what’s wrong with these guys? Sarah’s either a dream or a nightmare—possibly both.) We already know what happened to her previous husband, Adam, who paid the ultimate price for cheating. If only he’d kept his pants zipped, maybe Sarah wouldn’t have stabbed his mistress thirty-seven times (or was it twenty-five? Numbers aren’t my strength, but Sarah clearly keeps count).Anyway, moving on. Enter Ryan Stevens, the corrupt cop responsible for that disaster of an investigation from the first book. He’s now arrested for a drunk-driving incident that resulted in someone’s death. Naturally, he calls his lawyer… and guess who walks in? That’s right—Sarah Morgan. But just as things seem to settle, a shocking lab report leaks to the press, revealing Ryan’s DNA at Kelly Summers’ old crime scene. Suddenly, the cold case is reopened.Meanwhile, Stacy Howard—the woman who had a fling with Sarah’s current husband Bill—has mysteriously vanished. Bill accuses Sarah of being involved and threatens her if she doesn’t back down from the custody fight. Is he bluffing, or does he have something real that could link Sarah to not just one but two murders? Is Stacy a pawn in Sarah’s revenge plot, or is something even more sinister going on?All I can say is: grab your snacks, curl up, and prepare for a fast-paced, twist-filled thriller. This one pulls you in and doesn’t let go.Final Thoughts:The only downside? The characters are almost all unlikable. Sarah is cold and cunning, Bill is both cruel and clueless (a terrible combo), and even Sheriff Hudson feels underwhelming. Pam, thankfully, is likable—but she’s more of a side character.I’m rounding my 3.5 stars up to 4, mainly because of the strong pacing and the cleaner plot execution. The twists are mostly predictable, but they still work. This isn’t my favorite by the author, but it’s a big step up from the first book. I have a strong feeling this won’t be the last we hear from Sarah Morgan—and I wouldn’t be surprised if the next chapter is right around the corner.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter"
The Midnight Library,Matt Haig,3.98,"""That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""
No truer words have been said by Nora, the world's largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at the Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn't want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her regrets (of which there are many) and try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there's another one she would've liked better.Lest you think I'm a cold-hearted reader for not loving this, I mean, sure that does sound like me. I count coins in my bathtub, chase children off my lawn with my gnarly walking stick, and club seals for laughs at least once a day, if not more. So what's to like? No no, I'm just kidding. Really.Normally I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, I got absolutely zero feels unless you count frustration as a feel.For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be discerned if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these same lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take any situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but it's only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. Like come on, at some point, you just have to be okay with who you are and the decisions you've made without knowing every single possible outcome.But my biggest issue is that I'm really uncomfortable with this book's implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your mindset and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.We already have enough trouble as a society getting depression and mental illness taken seriously, without a ""feelgood"" book coming along and implying that you need nothing more than an attitude adjustment to cure it. That puts the blame squarely where it doesn't belong, on the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering from depression. But it isn't just the layman who harbors such misunderstandings. It also includes people who work in the mental health field, and even some therapists and psychiatrists. So you can understand my dismay at the continued popularity of this book, which further perpetrates this extremely toxic point of view.Please don't get me wrong. The message in here about having a positive attitude is a good one, and I'm all for it. But that worthwhile message slowly but surely got overshadowed by the implication that depression is nothing more than a mindset, and that's where I fall off the bandwagon. At times, I'm left wondering if the author started with the intention of the former and, over the course of writing this story, it somehow got away from him and he ended up with the latter instead.Obviously many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's decidedly not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've pretty much hated both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we're not compatible.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:How to Stop Time~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious. 
“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”
But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here: https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo","Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book is everywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options. Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many liked The Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, the majority liked this book so you might too and it's simply not my cup of tea. Yet, it was a dreadfully boring."
Remarkably Bright Creatures,Shelby Van Pelt,4.37,"This might be my favorite book this year, and will also be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Why did I love it so much? Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style. Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus? The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.","I wrongread the crap out of this one. I totally get why this has been such a hit for others. I mean, the world is shit and fiction is a great place to turn when you need something hopeful. I’ve fallen victim to the right time/right place heartstring-tugger a time or twelve myself. (See A Man Called Ove, The House in the Cerulean Sea, The Guncle, etc.) And like everyone else, I loved Marcellus and heard the “Sad Cat Diary” narrator each time he voiced a chapter that really brought a smile to my face . . . . 

But oh my god how did y’all tolerate Cameron? Freaking spoiled manbaby! So sorry your momma was a deadbeat and ditched you as a kid, but it’s not like you got dumped into the foster care system to rot. No, you were left with an aunt who not only loved you but coddled your ass into your dang 30s. Grow up, butthole! I broke my normal routine and poked around a few reviews since everyone but me loved this and I’ve noticed most don’t even mention him at all – despite him being a main character in the story. Maybe you all were simply able to ignore him???? I love a loveable loser, but this dude was a user and no redemption arc could make me like him.2.5 Stars","The book was incredibly slow and very mundane at times. More than halfway through nothing significant had happened. There were a few chapters that were completely pointless and didn't contribute to the story in any way.The author failed to give enough reasons for me to care about any of the characters. They all felt predictable and halfhearted.Cameron's character was just the regular annoying, whiny kind of loser who blames everybody else for his ""hard"" life. We are constantly reminded how smart he is and yet the only way his smarts present themselves is through some random trivia. A 30 year old man who was raised by an aunt who made sure he had a roof over his head, rather than just being thrown into the system, who still blames his mother for all of his life choices and mistakes, is not someone I can feel sorry for. Grow up and get your act together ffs.Marcellus was the only thing that kept the whole book together and he should have been given more space in it. I would have gladly read an entire book told only from his perspective."
Happy Place,Emily Henry,3.96,"➸ 4.25 stars

”in every universe, it’s you for me. even if it’s not me for you.”

— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift. can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life! did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called “happy place” i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make you happy. the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm! — this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between a past and present timeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.

”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”

 — second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending. ➳ harriet kilpatrick:harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace. the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough* i also hate my job. her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.➳ wyn connor:wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters. ꒰ wyn and harriet: ꒱i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹

“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”

➷ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was that friendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>> — overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!! — but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happy happy place release day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.","Buckle up, bitches, because I have some things to say.P.S: if you liked this book, I'm really really really happy for you. I wish that could be me! <3My review may contain some spoilers, you've been warned.I decided to give Emily Henry another chance after 
Beach Read,
 which I did not finish because it was bad in my opinion. So, I said ""Why not? Maybe this one turns out to be pretty good!"" and now that I finished it, I've realized (after a long night of overthinking and self-loathing. Yeah, I know, it wasn't my best night, lol) that maybe romance as a main plot isn't my genre.First of all, I've never ever been in love in my almost 25 years of miserable existence, nor someone has been in love with me, so I don't actually know how it really feels, (that's a deep and traumatic conversation for another day), but to me it's kind of unreal that people can last years and not get bored. Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's not a real thing , but I can't even start to imagine someone loving me for so long without getting bored of me. (Plot twist: deep down, I'm a hopeless romantic who yearns to love and be loved for a really long time and to be in a healthy relationship, but that's not gonna happen, so).Basically, Happy Place is about a second chance romance, between Harriet and Wyn (I swear I've never heard the name Wyndham until the day I started this book), who broke up five months ago and reunite for a trip with their best friends. They have to act like they're still together and pretend happiness and such just to not causing chaos.The jump from past to present was not for me. While I enjoy those kind of flashbacks, things were ""interesting"" in the present than in the past.I felt like a fucking third wheel. Or perhaps like I was in the middle of a friend group which I wasn't part of and it made me feel uncomfortable, (I've felt like that in the past, in many friend groups, and it feels awful) and if EH's point was to make me feel like I belonged with them, well, it didn't work out. They didn't even feel like best friends because there was a lot of tension and they were keeping secrets from each other (yes, I know this last thing happens a lot irl).The side characters had no personality whatsoever. They felt very flat and boring. Sabrina was controlling and kind of bitchy. Parth had zero personality. Cleo and Kimmy were okay, until I felt like they were not a lesbian couple, but a heterosexual couple where one of them is a guy with a girl's name. Don't come at me for this, I just felt it like that. I did enjoy when Sabrina was called out. I get that they were in that trip mourning their youth and trying to have a good time, but goddamn it was painful. I just could not stand them. Trust me, I'm good at mourning my wasted and non existent youth, but this was pure hell.Wyn was flat and boring. Gods, he had no personality and it was pretty clear. Even a shoe or a rock has more personality than Wyn Connor. What I hated the most is that basically Harriet was the one making the moves. Always. Man, if you really ""love her"" then go and fucking fight for her. MAKE SOME GODDAMN MOVES TO GET HER BACK AND LOVE HER PROPERLY.And Harriet, girly pop, please, have a little bit more of self-steem and respect for yourself. Stop being a people pleaser and try to save everyone. !I hate miscommunication. I believe it's one of the worst tropes ever and it's used throughout the book. Harriet complains and whines a lot, has a lot of inner monologues but she never says shit. Ma'am, please don't expect that everyone knows what the hell do you want if you never say anything. I'm not defending Wyn either, because he did the same thing. And they were constantly lying about how they were happy and okay. Both, Harriet and Wyn made a lot of assumptions instead of actually talk to each other, which could have spared us from a 400 pages book. Things could have solved up faster if they both had spoken first.Like, are you going to tell me that after a long-ass relationship of 8 YEARS, neither of you can communicate things? They could have broken up sooner if they just talked things through. It's like both communication and understanding were missing in the entire book. Also, breaking up with her over the phone? Are you fucking kidding me?This book could have been better if we had Wyn's POV. He obviously was struggling with depression, the loss of his father and his mother being diagnosed with Parkinson. We could have understood him more like this. But otherwise, he seemed indifferent about his relationship.My last straw was... Pottery? Really?Did you just throw so many years of med school, hard work and your residency for pottery? I don't know how things work for med school in the u.s, but, girly pop, I'm pretty sure that isn't cheap, not even when you study in a good school. And holy shit, she’s a neurosurgery resident. (My dream was to become a neurosurgeon, so I was speechless and almost screaming like Regina George in Mean Girls). I'm still speachless and amazed because how are you gonna pay your +$200,000 debts from pottery? Wyn must be a fucking billionare.I also felt nothing, nor empathy, sadness, pity or whatever towards any of these characters or their problems and relationships.The sex scene felt... Off. There was ""a lot"" of tension going on between Harriet and Wyn from the beginning, but when the sex scene finally came, it disappeared and felt dull.Anyways, not everything seems bad, lmao.I have this love/hate relationship with EH's writing style. For one side, there are some phrases where you can relate and say ""Same, sis, same."", but for the other side, Emily uses metaphors and stuff like that where is no needed.The only good thing, perhaps?I get the hype over Emily Henry's books, I swear I do, but they never captivate me or make me giggle, kick my feet in the air or feel happy. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe, like I said at the beginning of this review, maybe romance as a main is not for me.I'm not going to include this book in my big hype big lie shelf yet because I honestly didn't have many expectations for Happy Place. Nevermind, I just added to my big hipe, big lie shelf, lmao.This is where Emily Henry and I part ways.I guess I have more things to say, but I'll add them when I remember, lmao.","I mean... if we are all going to read it....3.5 StarsI know, I know, but before you all come for my head, hear me out.I have never been so conflicted by a book before. I simultaneously really loved and kind of hated this book. Let me start out by saying I think Emily Henry is an absolute poet, she is nothing short of a master at her craft and this book is probably some of her best writing so far. The pacing of this book, the alternating timelines, the character development, the relationships were all beautifully and expertly written. So, you are probably scratching your head thinking, ""Beck, so what was the problem?"" Well........ I just could never buy in to what this whole book is about in the first place, the break-up, let's just call it what it is, this is the miscommunication trope on STEROIDS, ""Oh but it was more complicated than that"" WAS IT THOUGH? And if I am being totally honest, I felt like the ending was not enough payoff for the all the emotional trauma we were all put through. Let me start with the things I loved-The writing- Nobody does it like EH. She is an absolute artist with her words, the way she can summon the perfect measure of every emotion into every page is stunning and so rare. I can't ignore or deny the absolute magic that this author weaves into every page. 
""It feels like a moment before a car accident, when the tires have started to hydroplane and you know something terrible is likely coming, but there's still a chance the tread will find purchase and you'll never know what agony you narrowly avoided.""
The chemistry- The chemistry between all her characters is so balanced and always feels authentic. The way her found family move around each other and interact with each other is so natural and genuine. And the chemistry between Wynn and Harriett was off the charts white hot! You could feel the sparks between them jumping off the page, it was palpable. 
""Maybe I need to know that he remembers that he hasn't totally forgotten what it feels like to love me, while I'm trapped with him buried onto my heart, my, brain, my lungs, my skin.""
Harriet- I really loved Harriet. She is entirely relatable; she is riddled with self-doubt and I appreciated her struggle to please those around her and form herself into what she thought the people she loved needed her to be while sacrificing her own wants and desires. I was thrilled for her when she finally started asserting herself and choosing her own path. 
""I'm not the brilliant doctor my parents wanted me to be, and I'm not the person who could give Wyn the happiness he deserves, and I'm not the friend Sabrina and Cleo needed.""
 😭Ok, what didn't work for me:WYNN- Uh oh!! Are you all screaming at me yet? It's not what you think, I DO love Wyn, I think he is sweet and charming and vulnerable, and he absolutely loves Harriett, but the man could not muster up the strength to fight for her even ONCE this entire book!! I kept waiting for him to finally grow and fight for Harriet and it just never happens, even at the end it is HARRIET that moves first, it's always Harriett. I understand when he was struggling before but by the end he is supposed to be in a better place and it's still the same with him. How are we supposed to believe that this relationship will ever last long term, bc things will inevitably get rocky again as do all long-term relationships, but I can't believe that he will ever step up, if Harriet doesn't hold them together it will fail again. Exibit A down below!!! 
""You can't follow me like I followed you. I won't be enough.""

""It'll get easier, he promises hoarsely, his hand brushing my hair behind my ear. ""Someday you'll hardly remember this""
See!!! He is literally drowning, and he refuses to kick!!!The Break-Up- More than half of this book is putting us all through this absolute all-consuming agony and heartache for these two people who so obviously deeply love each other and are both completely shattered and heartbroken. The back and forth between the timelines serves to build on this epic love that spans nine years! And the whole time you are thinking, ""What could have possibly happened to tear these two apart?"" And then we finally get there.... and it just didn't math for me. Misunderstandings and miscommunication? A four-minute phone call? REALLY? And then just total and complete acceptance? Naaahhhh. I don't buy it. Sorry not sorry, it's just not believable for me. So, if Sabrina never orchestrated that whole wkend? Then what? They would have just been resigned? It just makes all those beautiful promises that Wyn said to her feel so empty and I think he meant them. Why didn't he come find her when he was feeling better and got clarity. Why didn't she demand an explanation that she absolutely deserved? And this is just some advice THERAPY is your friend! All of this pain could have so easily been avoided. 
""I have been in love with her since we met, though,""

""No,"" he says quietly. ""In every universe, it's you for me. Even if it's not me for you.""

""If it was possible to stop loving you, I would have managed it in that first year of desperately trying to. I'm here. For good.""

""Do you want me to promise that I will love you forever Harriett? Because I will.""
The ending The woman is a DOCTOR, she could set up a private little practice in Montana and be home for dinner every night. Do you know how much those loans are? Pottery isn't cutting it babe sorry! This wasn't as big of a deal but it did irk me. Ok so even though I did have my issues with this book, obviously, I still really thought it was beautiful. The writing was stunning, and I obviously cared about the story bc this review is a mile long (sorry about that) Will I ever read it again? Hmm doubt it, bc Beach Read is right there. So current EH book rankings:1)Beach Read2)Book Lovers3)Happy Place4)PWMOV"
Beach Read,Emily Henry,3.99,"This is my favorite romance read of the year. It came in second place in the Goodreads Choice Awards voting, but my thoughts haven’t changed! I loved it so, so, so much!OH MY GOODNESS! Finally, the literature gods heard my prayers! I’ve been longing for a fantastic romance, something heart-wrenching that shakes me to the core and makes me feel everything at once: happiness, angst, joy, forgiveness, enjoyment, resentment, and hurt. Yes, I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I want to scream it! Oh, thankfully, I already did!I have to add: This is not a beach read. This is a GLUED READ. You don’t want to end it, and you don’t want to stop reading it, so you carry your book everywhere as if it’s one of your internal organs.I expected to read something more chic-lit, a soft, sweet story, but instead, I got an amazing work of fiction—a remarkable romance juggling so many themes at once: friendship, regrets, cancer, betrayal, dysfunctional families and their secrets, enemies to friends, friends to lovers, and rivalry between authors!The things I loved most:	•	Sarcastic but smart, entertaining, unique dialogues between January and Gus.	•	The soul-crushing, tear-jerking, heart-shattering, intense father-daughter relationship.	•	Captivating storytelling from the beginning: I couldn’t put this book down. I devoured the pages (maybe I accidentally licked my Kindle, but its screen looks dustless, and I’m the grossest person right now!). I couldn’t stop reading about January and Gus’ growing attraction, their struggles to open up, their fears of getting hurt, and their stupid and childish actions toward each other. Yes, I had so many “awww” and sighing moments. My husband thought I was secretly ordering cases of French wine because I smiled so much, and I got an appointment with the surgeon because my smile was glued to my face, making me look like a worse version of the Joker right now! I cannot stop!	•	A witty plot: Two writers, nemeses from college, now have neighboring beach houses. They both have deadlines for their books but are suffering from writer’s block! Gus thinks that happily-ever-afters don’t exist, but he can push himself to write about it, and January could write some high-rated, complex fiction instead of swoony romances! So they bet and switch genres, but to do that, they need to spend time together, experiencing both the bright and dark sides of life. This means January will take Gus to carnivals, romantic beaches, and field trips to watch the sunset, while Gus will take January hiking in graveyards or arrange an interview with a grieving woman who lost her sister to a death cult. See? It was impossible not to get hooked from the beginning!	•	Characterization: January and Gus seem like polar opposites—one a pessimist who had a problematic childhood with his abusive father, and the other an optimist who loves to see the brighter side, even though her childhood was overshadowed by her mother’s battle with cancer. They are both suffering from loneliness and wrong choices in their love lives. Actually, they have so much in common, not to mention the SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and UNDENIABLY GROWING ATTRACTION!THE LAST PARTS OF THE BOOK: Oh boy! Please prepare your napkins, paper towels, anything to dry your non-stop dripping tears! I’m not giving spoilers, but Ms. Henry is an emotional torturer who knows exactly how to sing to our hearts, break them into pieces, and then magically gather and heal each piece with her soul-brushing, poignant words. She is a heart whisperer. She knows how to melt your heart!OVERALL: This is not only one of my favorite books of this year but also one of my all-time favorite romance books! I’m so happy my craving for a well-written romantic fiction is over!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this year’s one of the best books’ ARC copy with me in exchange for my honest review. And Emily Henry, thank you for reaching my heart with your effective, soul-touching, and talented work.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, and astrology:Medium BlogInstagramFacebookTwitter","His eyes were doing the thing, the Gus thing . . . and it made my chest flutter almost painfully.
I don't get it. What am I missing here?Beach Read originally caught my eye because its premise reminded me of Summer Villa, one of my favorite Hallmark movies. I know, I'm publicly admitting to being a sappy romantic at heart. And I'm proud of it. So why couldn't I get into this story at all?For one, I didn't feel any chemistry between January and Gus. Nothing. Their interactions are so awkward and stilted, it was almost painful. They'll say mundane and platonic things to each other, and then sporadically, January will remind us that heat is filling her abdomen or pooling between her legs, and I'm like, Eh? I can't imagine how two people could possibly fall in love or lust while saying such bland things to each other.This is the second book I've read by Emily Henry, and I've noticed that her female characters tend to be very twee and precious. They have extremely high expectations of what love is, need to be constantly reassured, and freak out at the smallest blip. At one point, January sees Gus's ex at a public event and she wants to scream and cry, before the woman has even said or done anything. And what's up with calling herself ""dumb bunny""? Not to mention, she spends the entire time being upset with her dad over something that was none of her business. Suffice to say, it's all very exhausting.As for Gus, we are told over and over that he has a crooked mouth and messy hair, wears rumpled and faded clothes, and has a sexy/evil look (what does that even mean?). Otherwise, his only characteristics are that he writes novels, and he adores January for no reasons that I could discern.The writing style is fluffed out to the excess. There is so much mundane details about every event/non-event, from the multiple-page conversations on should they go or not go, to the logistical details (transportation/gift bringing/preferred topics of conversation) to the minutiae of everything that happens while at the event. And in between, every step of the way, it is interspersed with information on how January is feeling, how she thinks Gus must be feeling, and what this means for their relationship. They are also constantly affirming what great people the other one is. Gus is dark and broken, but great! January is a fairy princess and a bright light, but great too! And they keep checking in to see if the other is happy. Like, are you happy? I am, are you happy? The conversations were so cheesy and trite, I was crying on the inside.A good portion of this book is spent on the details of the stories they are each writing and their related research. One is a love story that takes place in a cult and the other is a love story that takes place... in a circus with clowns? I don't even know what I'm reading anymore.Where is the flirty banter, the sexual tension, the obstacles to overcome? I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, or some interesting dialog, or some insight from this story. But nada. I'll be honest, this is one of the most boring books I've ever read.My criteria for a romcom isn't that high. I want romance and comedy, but this book didn't satisfy either. I neither swooned nor laughed. I was mostly exhausted from boredom while waiting for this dull story to be over.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:People We Meet on VacationFunny Story~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would, and that makes me sad. I had this as a five star prediction, one of my most anticipated of the year because this premise sounds PERFECT to me. I love books that follow writers, and I love the idea of two writers swapping genres and competing to sell their book first and have a kind of hate to love vibe but also being really cute still. When I started reading this I was certain it was going to be a five star read, and trust me no one is as bummed a I am that I didn't absolutely love this. I wanted to be obsessed with it the way I am with Unhoneymooners and The Hating Game, but this book just isn't it...This book started off fine, I actually really like January's character in the beginning. I feel like Gus, the live interest is one of my issues with the book. He comes off as kind of pretentious at times, and he has this attitude like ""i'm so broken that nobody can ever understand me"" and he doesn't believe in happy endings, he's such a cliche stereotypical brooding moody man character. I feel like the mood of this book was all over the place, because some of it was trying to be light and fluffy 'beach read' as the title implies, but then some of it was actually dark, like January finding out her recently dead Father was cheating on her Mom her whole life, and Gus making them do all these interviews with people from a cult for writing research, or people who's siblings killed themselves... like some of it got really dark so the tone of the book would shift constantly and it just didn't flow. I feel like some of their banter was freaking amazing and *chefs kiss*, but then some of their banter, especially towards the middle felt so forced and like the author was trying too hard to make them seem cute. I feel like January's character was wayyyyyy too insecure about some things, like damn Gus made a comment about her being a fairy princess at the beginning of the book and she literally brings it up constantly throughout the entire book.I feel like Gus's type of male character is annoying because he basically admits he was only an asshole to her because he was in love with her, and like that's obnoxious. I hate how also after the first time they have sex he basically tells her to leave when he gets an important phone call, such a dick move. And then he goes from being kind of an asshole to being like 'i'm in love with you' so freaking quickly, it was cringey. And the actual ending, the last chapter was so cheesy. Of course it ends with a cheesy proposal, like every other romance novel out there.I also wanted more of their stories they were writing, because that is what made me so interesting in reading this in the first place, I was especially curious about Gus's romance novel and I just wish we got more information about the books they were writing. So what did I love about this book? I loved the first 100-150 pages, I loved some of the banter, I loved the scenes of them actually writing (I just really love reading about writers as an aspiring writer), I love the complicated relationship between January and her now dead Father, I love the competitive-ness between January and Gus when they are trying to write something outside of their usual genre that would still sell. I guess I just had too high of expectations for this after hearing the premise and there was just something about this book that didn't quite click with me, and I'm sad about it."
Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,4.35,"buddy read with ""who is Scotty?"" and ""why does she judge him for buying one plate?""i hope those two have fun but i'm outta here. dnf 50% in. thank you for everyone who encouraged me to do this: i love you. everyone who wanted me to finish: i have nothing to say to you.this will be the last Colleen Hoover book i'll ever read (and i already didn't even want to read this one, i was asked to)if someone points a gun at me and says ""i won't kill you if you read a Colleen Hoover book"", i'll be like ""well, guess today's the day i die then""Colleen and me don't vibe, never have, never will, and i honestly don't understand what y'all see in her books but who am i to judge your reading tastes - hope you're all having fun and enjoying life.i was told to see the bright side in things, so, on the bright side: i now know what book to add to my worst reads of the year in december, so look forward to that.yes, me dnf'ing it 50% in will not stop me from putting it into that ranking, leave me alone.why am i dnf'ing? listen, i had to like physically hype myself up to read every single sentence: ""Let's go Jonathan!!! You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's not that bad!!"" i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want to look at this, let alone read it.here's what i liked:this scene - ""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously be SPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."" ). No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.","With Reminders of Him, Colleen Hoover cements her status as queen of the emotional read.You'd think having read so many of Hoover's books, I would be better prepared. One, always have a box of tissues ready. Two, never read it in public. But I haven't learned my lesson. This time, I was in the doctor's office, sitting in the waiting room, when I got walloped with the feels. I tried to pass it off as allergies, but sobbing and allergies don't exactly look the same, you know?Kenna has just been released from prison, where she served her time for an accident that had forever altered the course of her life. She returns to the town where it all went wrong, in the hopes of being reunited with the daughter she's never known. But old grudges die hard, and the town isn't so ready to welcome her back. The only ally she may have is Ledger, owner of the local bar, who has his own ties to her past.This book sure packs a punch. I don't know if it's just where I am in my life currently, but reading about Kenna's separation from her daughter was particularly painful and heartbreaking. It was hard not to cry through most of it, if I'm being honest. The other thing that really struck a chord with me is Kenna's hope for a second chance after having done her time. It's still pretty rare for literature to include this important theme, and I'm always so heartened to see it.There are so many sides to this story, so many different ways of looking at it. There's no real right or wrong, just lots of gray in the middle. It wouldn't surprise me if a lot of readers felt strongly that Kenna's situation is too harsh or too lenient. And I certainly wouldn't be surprised if those two groups ended up overlapping, with the same readers feeling both. This is exactly the sort of story that balances on an edge, tugging your heartstrings one way, then another.If I had one quibble, it's that the pacing of the story felt a little bit off. The middle part dragged on for longer than necessary without much in the way of plot advances. Then when we get to the end, the resolution happens seemingly out of nowhere, without any of the anticipated pushbacks. After the odyssey that was the journey, the ending felt a bit abrupt to me.Still, Colleen Hoover is known for delivering eminently readable stories, and this is just as riveting as the rest. Though she puts so much emotional toil into them, they never make me want to turn away. I want to continue flipping the pages. I want to feel whatever emotional punishment she has in store for me. And that's what makes her stories so special.Just don't forget my two tips if you're going to read this. And maybe I'll even remember them myself one day.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us ✧ It Starts with UsVerityRegretting YouUgly Love Layla ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","colleen hoover put her whole colussy into this one…and she delivers once again. this goes down as another colleen hoover book that i devoured and ate tf up!my favorite thing about these books are the writing and characters. without even really noticing it, i found myself relating to Kenna (mc) and the emotions she went through. her growth and self forgiveness was the best thing to read through out the novel. she proves people make bad decisions but that doesn’t mean they are bad people. she shows that in her selflessness and fight. Ledger was an interesting character to read about. at times i was so enthralled by him. he was introduced as the dude that owns a bar, former NFL player, drives a truck, and tattoos?!?! like what more could i want ?!! 😍 and then there were moments that i was so heated and angry that i wanted to punch sense into him. he was a hard character to grow on but at last he charmed me. seriously, i couldn’t decide if i wanted to back hand slap him or ride him. i chose the latter…hehehehehehdid i find myself crying uncontrollably? abso-fucking-lutely! it wouldn’t be a colleen hoover book if not tf? i made the mistake of bringing this book to work to read to make the time pass by. 2 hours into my shift i find myself crying, sobbing, and shaking uncontrollably. my co-workers notice and the first thing i say is “oh allergy season” and that’s a complete fucking lie because it’s fucking snowing outside but you can’t let the boss find out that you’ve been hiding in a corner reading an incredible book instead of doing the work you’re actually hired to do… warning: do not bring CoHo books to work! you are setting yourself up for disaster! but fortunately the crying wasn’t even entirely because of sad scenes or anything traumatic, it was the scenes towards the end that left the biggest smile on my face. things really came full circle. i usually skip over acknowledgements but i read this one and i encourage you to do the same. my favorite line even came from the acknowledgments not the story itself. now idk what to do with my life?!? guess i’ll drive into the sunset to fill this void this book left me with.

Kuang,3.74,"2/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do. yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn't work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way. my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc. this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way. so many mouthpieces. i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing as framing and context which are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie, when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary. despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrative is juniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was, ‘…that’s it?’ i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says, ‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’ Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface. it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere. oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:  ""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""  but what happens after? we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we've seen the cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that it teases you with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assault edit 24/05/2023:  unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1) i am not white. i am asian,  2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired. in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about. 'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.' go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry. and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.","‘Don’t ghosts just want to be remembered?’A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn’t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods “culture wars” to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates over American Dirt, which sparked months of controversy over white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’s Yellowface sinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up to Babel and the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead, Yellowface reads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’s Yellowface asks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously, Yellowface feels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories. Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We’ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about being the ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’s Who Is the Bad Art Friend? article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest to Yellowface is the one surrounding Kristen Roupenian’s short story Cat Person (you can read it here) which was defended then later attacked when an article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story. The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack. ‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trolls will find them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘ Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaints American Dirt was canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published. ‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘ neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titled The Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the film Dunkirk and becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength). ‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it's rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, there are some horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are 80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about 75% of published authors in the US are white and a 2020 study showed 95% of all books published were by white authors the previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then, a recent survey shows only a 1% change in the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and how Real Life was reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I'm reminded of the reasons authors pushed against #OwnVoices labels as Becky Albertalli felt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.  ‘Do you know what it's like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can't put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you're redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at how everyone else is the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod to Andrea Long Chu as Vartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels like The Help and The Good Earth in a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism There is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. As Edward Said wrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process of The Last Front we watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits. Yellowface by R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision and Yellowface makes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the books Beautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante's Neapolitan novels and told everyone to read Murderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.","lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she's capable of being funny. like here's a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel about incest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it's absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it's not subtle but when done in satire it's not AS hamhanded as kuang's dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don't will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction—character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination—was comparatively weak. here there's no research to hold it up, just kuang's own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit—something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this year in the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told—and genuinely believes—that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the 'publishing details' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don't match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don't come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don't come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there's a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it's fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there's a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang's work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants—she didn't want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang's own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that's so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called 'pepper jack cheese' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that's my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang's pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like 'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy's haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous—of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there's room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it's humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say 'talk to the hand! and DON'T tell me to log off' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i'm worried that she does."
Lessons in Chemistry,Bonnie Garmus,4.28,"(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)[plot spoilers]I had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.So this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.This all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!So this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!But there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.I'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.P.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!","1.5 stars The synopsis describes this book as “laugh out loud funny”, recommended for fans of Where’d You Go Bernadette and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. A female chemist in the ‘50s? Great! Count me in.BUT….I obviously read a different book. - this book should be shelved in the fantasy section. Seriously. It’s fantasy. Which is fine, but if I had known I would have skipped it. The switch between fantastical elements and serious ones gave me whiplash. - Funny? Within a few pages a woman is called a c*** twice, a brutal rape is described in detail, and there’s a suicide due to homophobia. Yeah, just hilarious.- I’m over quirky characters who behave as if they are on the spectrum. Why can’t we have a woman who is a brilliant chemist but isn’t naive, socially awkward, and clueless? Except when she’s not, usually in time to deliver another monologue. - the MC’s daughter is a genius who knew the periodic table as a preschooler and reads the Sound and the Fury at age 8. Of course she is. Very relatable. - Elizabeth’s views and actions were not consistent with the era. It’s as if a woman from 2022 time traveled back to the 1950s and then lectured everyone with lengthy monologues on social issues and women’s rights. I don’t need a lecture and I don’t need to be repeatedly hit over the head on relevant social issues. This book needed more showing, less telling. - the message is a worthy one. A woman ahead of her time in STEM who must fight the status quo in a male dominated world. But I think the message would have been stronger and more authentic if it had been realistic. There’s a lot of exaggeration and preposterous situations to drive a point home, which is not my favorite storytelling technique.- all the men, with one exception, were ugly and hateful misogynists. I’m weary of male-bashing in fiction. - Did I need to read details of a man who masturbates and flings pubic hairs across the room, leaving behind his sticky porn magazines for his wife to clean up? No I did not 🤮 - Atheism vs Faith. The author mentions multiple times that this is a free country and we have a right to our beliefs. I 100% agree. But she apparently believes only atheists have a right to their beliefs. I’m no bible thumping extremist, but it’s offensive when religion and people of faith are portrayed only in derogatory terms, such as faith is “a simpleton’s recipe for prayers and beads” and a funeral service was “boring verse and preposterous prayers”. A minister muses that the problem with his job “was how many times he had to lie”. The ministers and priests were all child abusers, liars, and greedy crooks. Lay people of faith were all violent protestors and/or morons. The message repeatedly driven home throughout the book, ad nauseam? Atheism = good People of faith = bad.Believe me, if the author had portrayed atheists as all bad I would find it equally as offensive. Why is intolerance of beliefs/religion the last acceptable prejudice? - I’m weary of the argument of science vs religion. Sure there are extremists who deny science but the majority of people and religions do not believe they are mutually exclusive. There are plenty of religious scientists. Sigh….- Anachronisms. Subsidized child care in Sweden wasn’t enacted until 1975, although the MC refers to it in 1960. And was defunding the police a thing in the early 1950s? I think not. - certainly women have been, and are, discriminated against. I’m not denying that bias occurs but the exaggeration and preposterous events in the story hinders the message. I have a science degree. I took many college courses in STEM. I worked in a male dominated work culture. In this book every single man in a power position was a misogynist. Not realistic. Please stop it..- Also, we are given information at the end that suggests there was a valid reason Elizabeth wasn’t accepted in the doctoral program, that had nothing to do with her gender or an incident that happened early in the book. This confused me?! What was the message? 🤷🏻‍♀️No book is without merit. The positives: - I am not usually a fan of anthropomorphism but I loved the dog, Six-Thirty. By far he was my favorite character. And yay, he survives! 😍- the cooking show was cute * this was a buddy read with Marialyce and another book to throw on top of the 2022 disappointing reads category. * I received a digital copy for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own","I gave all of my votes to this book, both for the best debut and historical fiction categories, at the Goodreads Choice Awards. I'm thrilled to find out that Barnes & Noble has chosen this brilliant work as the book of the year - it is highly deserved! Amazing news, my friends! This fantastic book has been adapted into a streaming series on Apple TV, starring Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott and an outstanding cast crew including Lewis Pullman, Beau Bridges, Ana Naomi King, Kevin Sussman, Thomas Mann, Stephanie Koenig, and Patrick Walker. I cannot wait to binge-watch it! Okay, folks, I just finished the best book of 2022! Now I can relax knowing that I don't need to search for something better. No, wait, I lied. Not about finding the best book - this one is freaking amazing - but I will continue to search for exemplary fictions like this that can speak to my heart and soul at the same time! I give it five gazillion stars! I loved the author's extra-intelligent, dark, original sense of humor, and I fell in love with her characters. The story of Elizabeth brought out so many complex feelings: I laughed, I got angry, I cried, I sighed, I laughed again, and as soon as I finished the last chapter, I gave my ovation! This is an underrated secret gem! Don't you dare skip this book or let it sit in your TBR pile. Just read it! Let me give you a summary of the plot and introduce you to the characters: Elizabeth Zott: How can I express my feelings about this character? She's so unique, different, extraordinary, visionary, extremely quirky, odd, straightforward, honest, a real feminist, intelligent, intellectual, fighter, survivor, and a brilliant scientist who is brave enough to fight for her rights and her loved ones against mansplaining, inequality, abuse, and humiliation!In 1960, after her traumatic experience at UCLA, she starts working at the Hastings Research Institute, which is administered with a male workforce that ignores her enthusiasm and hard work. Only one person sees her and shows respect for her accomplishments: an aspiring, Nobel Prize-nominated, grudge-holder named Calvin Evans. The first time they met, he thought she was a secretary, and the second time they met, he vomited on her. There is nothing ordinary about their love story. They are soul mates. They are great minds alike. They are the quirkiest, most unconventional couple. They row together. They adopt the ugliest and most loyal, incredible dog and name him Six-Thirty. They were happy, even though Elizabeth rejected marrying him because she wanted to become an independent scientist without being acknowledged for her husband's contributions.But then... We fast-forward to see Elizabeth building a new life, raising her four-year-old, extra-smart, one-of-a-kind, sweetest girl named Mad Zott, helping their dog Six-Thirty improve his vocabulary skills, and most importantly, she's a TV star now! She teaches women to use chemistry not only in their kitchen but in their entire life to embrace change and challenges. She hosts the most eccentric cooking show called ""Supper at Six."" Her blunt and honest comments about marriage, religion, and society's norms will be considered rebellious and unconventional. Elizabeth is not alone. She has a 55-year-old, devoted neighbor named Harriet Sloane, who truly detests her husband. She has her supporting producer, Walter Pine, who believed in her enough to give her a chance on TV while raising his daughter by himself. Dr. Mason likes to row with her, stopping by to wash her dishes and check her out. But Mad thinks her mother is unhappy, and her homework to create a family tree pushes her to search for more information about her father's past. She has no idea that her search will uncover many long-kept secrets.Overall, this is the best book I have read lately! I fell in love with everything about this story and highly, extremely, and absolutely recommend it.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
The Missing Half,"Ashley Flowers, Alex Kiester",3.97,"Oh my goodness! You need a drink after reading the last chapters of this book! My blood runs cold! I didn't see some twists coming, and I still feel flabbergasted, sad, and numb all at once! It feels like broken glass tearing through your skin! This is one of those books that will stay with you forever, and each time you remember how everything concludes, you oscillate between crying aloud and sighing heavily. It truly broke my heart! I think I'll need at least three days to gather myself or start reading anything new after the effects of this story slowly dissipate.If you're tough enough to embrace darkness and raw sadness, read this meaningful sisterhood saga. It's one of the most thought-provoking stories I've read lately, and I'm certain it's one of the best women's fiction meets dark thriller/mystery novels of 2025!The main story revolves around two women with one common thread: both of their sisters were taken two weeks apart in 2012. Their bodies were never found, but their families are already broken, having said goodbye without closure.Nicole ""Nic"" Monroe hit rock bottom at age 24. Losing her sister was like losing her best friend, real mother, guardian, and anchor to survival! Their alcoholic mother left the house, and their father lives in denial, refusing to discuss the tragedy or support Nic. After getting a DWI, Nic starts community service at a shelter, attending AA meetings, and working as a waitress at Funland, her family friends' business, for eight years. She hasn't progressed in life, still living in a dinky apartment in her hometown of Mishawaka, numbing her pain with alcohol. She didn't go to college, make friends, or look for better jobs. She's locked herself in a purgatory that prevents her from moving on, stuck at the moment her sister vanished, leaving only her car and purse behind. Losing Kasey feels like losing a limb. Deep in her gut, she knows somebody took her sister and she'll never return!When Jenna Connor, sister of another missing girl Jules who disappeared two weeks before Kasey, appears at Nic's workplace with a clue connecting the two cases, Nic can't resist listening – even though it might drag her into dangerous circumstances while investigating both Mishawaka girls' disappearances.As they team up, secrets from Nic's inner circle begin to surface, and she realizes Jenna might be the only person she can fully trust when everyone else has left her to spiral. Learning the truth might open a can of worms, and Nic will discover that sometimes ignorance is bliss, though it's time for her to confront harsh realities instead of numbing herself. What she doesn't know is that truth comes with a hefty price she may barely handle!Overall: This is great literature – heart-wrenching, extremely emotional, shocking, well-executed mystery with layered, perfectly developed characterization made me love this book so much! I couldn't recommend it more! I liked it even better than ""All Good People Here""!Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group-Ballantine-Bantam for sharing this well-executed thriller's digital review copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","Hypnotic, addictive, and thoroughly twisted, The Missing Half took my expectations and ran them down before then reversing and repeating the maneuver. Not in a bad way, of course. No, quite the opposite, in fact, as Ms. Flowers delivered a plot that felt both perfectly crafted and beyond realistic. From the root-for-able amateur sleuths to the unguessable conclusion, there was no end to the winning attributes in this stunning slam dunk. And when I say unguessable, I truly mean it. As inevitable as it was tragic, the climax and conclusion had me reading at speed thanks to a poignant revelation that hit me hard as could be. After all, this dynamite plot came together with utter, devastating precision.Thanks to a ratcheting pace, finely layered characters, and a wealth of long-buried secrets, once I was hooked by this book, there was no chance of me putting it down. So much so, in fact, that I started and finished it in one single sitting. I mean, how could I have stepped away from a plot that delivered an IV drip of revelations that was buttressed by several jaw-dropping reveals? Even before any of that, though, the broken personas and serious themes meant a novel not only primed with nonstop suspense but rounded out with stunning depth to its pages. Exploring addiction, grief, and the lengths one will go to for family, this book is sure to resonate with all who dive into its riveting story.All said and done, this gripping tale of psychological suspense had everything I could want. Sprinkled with deftly obscured clues and convincing red herrings as well as a complex plot, low-key cliffhangers, and a nuanced first half, I quickly got pulled into the story despite its initial slow burn. Once I hit that first shocking twist, though, all bets were off as the pace picked up speed. What really got me, however, was how well-written and fluid the storyline was. Thanks to edge-of-your-seat tension that never relented and a masterful character arc for the protagonist, I am now 100% smitten with this new-to-me author. So if you’re looking for a sharp, clever novel, grab this one now. After all, it was an out-and-out home run. Rating of 5 stars.SYNOPSIS:Nicole “Nic” Monroe is in a rut. At twenty-four, she lives alone in a dinky apartment in her hometown of Mishawaka, Indiana, she’s just gotten a DWI, and she works the same dead-end job she’s been working since high school, a job she only has because her boss is a family friend and feels sorry for her. Everyone has felt sorry for her for the last seven years—since the day her older sister, Kasey, vanished without a trace.On the night Kasey went missing, her car was found over a hundred miles from home. The driver’s door was open and her purse was untouched in the seat next to it. The only real clue in her disappearance was Jules Connor, another young woman from the same area who disappeared in the same way, two weeks earlier. But with so little for the police to go on, both cases eventually went cold.Nic wants nothing more than to move on from her sister’s disappearance and the state it’s left her in. But then one day, Jules’s sister, Jenna Connor, walks into Nic’s life and offers her something she hasn’t felt in a long time: hope. What follows is a gripping tale of two sisters who will do anything to find their missing halves, even if it means destroying everything they’ve ever known.Thank you to Ashley Flowers and Random House—Bantam for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: May 6, 2025Content warning: missing persons, alcohol abuse, infidelity, violence, drunk driving, cancer","I could not put this one down. Two girls disappear within a couple weeks of each other and years later their 2 sisters team up to decide to finally figure out what happened to them.I did not expect the ending at all. I suspected tons of different scenarios throughout the book, but what really happened surprised me. I think this book was very well written. It was very exciting and I really enjoyed it.Surprise endings can sometimes be cheesy or feel rushed and forced. This one was done beautifully and I felt like this exact story could be something that happened in real life.Thank you to netgalley for this free advance copy in exchange for an honest review."

ARE. THE. DEAD. Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak ""Double Plus Good.""Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't help it. My mind is completely fried.This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I'm almost glad I didn't. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it fully.From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.For instance, he talks about how the act of writing itself is a type of time travel. It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.The politics and psychology of this novel run deep. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn't the name of the book. In the story, they don't actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don't have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.I wasn't expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn't sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn't necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, ""Of course, the many is more important than the one"", but when inside Winston's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace. Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can't answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world's, and maybe that's part of the problem but it's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I'm naive for thinking that way, but so be it.I almost don't know what to think about this book. I'm not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.Everything about this book is captivating. It's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it's all worth it in the end. It's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don't re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee,4.26,"2024: Each time I read what PBS dubs the perfect American novel, my heart fills just a little more. There are few books where the beginning paragraphs hit a home run for me, and this is one of them. It has been a long month filled with family time and endless cooking so for the last ten days I opted for comfort reads and there is no family who provides comfort like the Finches, with the exception of Aunt Alexandra. “Lawyers were children once,” quotes Charles Lamb in the opening epithet. Prior to this reading, I viewed Atticus Finch as an unapproachable, older father. Beloved by his children to the point of idolization, but with an impenetrable outer skin. As an adult looking back at the events which shaped the novel, Scout paints the picture of her father as one who makes everything right and makes her feel safe. Even though this novel had been marketed for adults, it is in its essence a coming of age novel, which shows Scout’s growth through elementary school while her family faces events that mean to alter the history of a town. Atticus would need to be a strong figure to guide his children through the plot, and he would need to wistfully remember his childhood in order to relate to them. This is the man who told us all to walk in another’s shoes and see things from their point of view. Until today, I never viewed Atticus as multi-faceted, just a great man. Today that view slightly changed, yet he remains one of my top personas of all time. Pestering Boo Radley is like killing a mockingbird, Scout implores Atticus. He never did anyone harm. There is a reason why this novel won the Pulitzer as being ahead of its time. The beginning and ending paragraphs mirror each other and provide closure. Scout and Dill engage in childhood escapades while learning life lessons imparted on them by their neighbors. Jem believes that the story began the summer Dill came and he tried to make Boo Radley come out. Being four years Scout’s senior at the time, he already saw the events of the novel from an adult perspective. Scout and Dill did not. They started as innocent seven year olds who thought that they would get married one day and ended as empathetic individuals who wanted to change the world. Perhaps Atticus’ lessons had penetrated these children after all; Scout, at least, looked like a lawyer in the making. If the world changed in her lifetime, perhaps she would get that opportunity. With a book as perfect as this one, it comes as little wonder to me that Harper Lee never published another in her lifetime. She became a recluse; perhaps she modeled Boo Radley after her own tendencies. Boo did not come out because he did not want to. I am of the camp who is 99.9% sure to never read Go Set a Watchman. To Kill a Mockingbird is practically perfect in every way and made to change the way a nation thought about groups of people. Harper Lee had as much courage in publishing it pre- Civil Rights Act as the characters in her novel did in living with there preconceived notions of how the world functions. Bravery, courage, and empathy remain the overarching motifs in this great American novel. I view it as the ultimate comfort read and in the words of my reading friend Tessa, five stars and a heart. 2019: With endless books and infinitely more to be written in the future, it is rare occasion that I take the time to reread a novel. As women’s history month is upon us (2019), I have kept revising my monthly lineup to feature books by remarkable women across the spectrum. Yet, none of these nonfiction books pay homage to the writers of the books themselves. Even with memoirs, the prose focuses on the author’s achievements in her chosen field. Last week a goodreads friend and I paid tribute to women authors in a daily literary journal. In one of my friend’s posts, she pointed out that as recently as 1960, the author of the most endearing of American novels had to use a masculinized version of her name in fear of not being published. Nelle Harper Lee of Monroeville, Alabama published To Kill a Mockingbird under her middle name, so only those well read readers are aware of the author’s full name. It is in this regard, that I included Pulitzer and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Nelle Harper Lee in my Women’s History month lineup. It is as auspicious of a time as any to reread one of America’s greatest novels. When I was in ninth grade English class, I read Harper Lee’s novel for the first time. At age fourteen I was hardly a polished writer and struggled with many of the assignments. Yet, I do remember that the top essay in the class focused on the overarching theme of courage and how Harper Lee showed how each of the characters, major and minor, embodied this trait in the trying times associated with the novel. It was courageous of a southern woman to write a novel with this subject matter prior to the passage of the civil rights act. It is of little wonder to me looking back now that she chose to publish under a gender neutral name. Perhaps, she feared a lynch mob or being outcast in her home town. It was a trying time as the federal government asserted itself against states still grieving from the war between the states and holding out as the last bulwarks of white superiority. Harper Lee exhibited as much courage as the characters in her novel, and rightfully was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her work. As such, being courageous starts from the top and works its way down to each and every character of this timeless work. In 1930s rural Maycomb, Alabama people were pretty much set in their way of life. Town folk had received an education and worked as lawyers, doctors, bankers, and businessmen. The country folk may or may not have received an education because they had to work the fields and many were illiterate. Even the majority of those educated white folk still saw themselves as superior to blacks, and few, if any, had the audacity to take a black’s word over a white’s even if it were the correct moral thing to do. Yet, the crux of Lee’s novel is a court case threatening to disrupt this way of life, having the town divide along both racial and moral lines, and having each character step into others’ shoes and view the world from another’s perspective. Maycomb at the time embodied many rural American cities, isolated from progress as town set in its ways with few people who were willing to see the world from another perspective. One man was, however, a lawyer named Atticus Finch who is among the most revered fictional characters ever created. Even though this court case should not have been his, his superiors selected Atticus to counsel a black defendant because they realized that he was the one man in Maycomb who had both the ability to empathize and the courage to do so. His neighbor Mrs Maudie Atkinson noted that Atticus was the same man in the court house as he was at home and had nothing to fear. A widower, he instilled these values to his children Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout) from a young age, passing a strong moral compass onto his children. In addition to critiquing southern race relations, Lee’s novel has endeared itself to children with the legend of Boo Radley. From the time they were young, Jem, Scout, and their summer friend Dill had courage to go to the Radley house trying to get Boo to come out even though all the other kids said the house was spooked. Atticus told them to put a halt to these childish games and explained Boo Radley’s background to them. The town claimed that Boo Radley was a ghost, but perhaps the reason he did not leave the house is because he did not want to. As the children grew older, Atticus warned them that there would be darker times ahead and they would have to be courageous in the face of what people said to them behind their backs. From the time Scout began school in first grade, she inhibited Atticus’ ability to stand up for what was right. Her teacher Miss Robinson was new to Maycomb and did not understand people’s ways. Scout explained about the Cunninghams, the Ewells, as well as other families at a personal cost to herself. As Scout grew older and was able to step into other people’s’ shoes more, she grew to understand differences between folks; however, she and Jem realized that differences did not make the world distinctly black and white or right and wrong. During an era when children were looked upon as unintelligent, Scout and Jem were wise beyond their years and following in their father’s footsteps. Harper Lee created strong archetypal characters and had each embody their own courage. Each’s courage allowed Atticus to teach his children a life lesson that would endure for the rest of their lives. The family’s neighbor Mrs. Henry Lafayette DuBose demonstrates courage as she battles a final illness. Third grade teacher Mrs. Gates exhibits courage as she teaches Scout’s class about the rise of Nazism in Germany and th encourages her students to think for themselves about the differences between prejudices at home and abroad. The African American characters all demonstrate strong courage as well. The Finch’s housekeeper Calpurnia is a bridge between the white and black communities of Maycomb and does not hesitate to teach Scout and Jem life lessons as they arise. The Reverend Sykes welcomes Jem and Scout into his congregation as though they were his own and invites them to sit in the colored balcony at time when segregation was still the law. He risked a lynching and knew that the Finch family could possibly be labeled as negro lovers, yet Reverend Sykes played a small role in proving that one’s skin color should not determine whether someone is right or wrong. Of course, as part of the overarching story line, Boo Radley can be viewed as the most courageous character of them all. It is through the courage of an author to create characters who will stand up for what is morally right at a large cost to themselves that she created an award winning novel that was ahead of its time for its era. It is little wonder that the courage of these fictional characters has made the novel as beloved as it is today. I believe that the courage exhibited by all these characters has made the town of Maycomb, Alabama stand the test of time and remain the timeless classic that it is. Most people can relate to those who have the courage to stand up for what they think is right or to fight against those tougher than them. This character trait has endeared the Finch family to millions of readers and will continue to do so for generations to come. Whenever a person asks what book would you give as a gift or what is the perfect book, To Kill a Mockingbird is my first choice. I find that it is perfect for any time but most appropriate in spring as in addition to courage there is an underlying theme of hope. Harper Lee won the Pulitzer for this timeless classic, and it also won first place in the Great American Read as America’s best novel. Thus I can think of no better way to honor women’s history month than with a timeless book that has and will continue to capture the hearts and minds of all of its readers. 5+ stars/ all-time favorites shelf","/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.","6.0 stars. I know I am risking a serious “FILM AT 11” moment and a club upside the head from Captain Obvious for voicing this, but nabbit dog I still think it needs to be said…TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the BEST and MOST IMPORTANT American novels ever written. Okay, I said it, and I will wait patiently while you get your DUHs and DERs out of the way and hang your “no shit” signs outside for Inspector Holmes.Okay, now given the gruntload of reviews/ratings this book has I know I’m not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is. Still, I am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because I truly have a pile of love for this book. …(Sorry for taking the metanalogy there just now, but I promise no more poop references for the rest of the review)... So if my review can bring a few more people into the Atticus Finch Fan Club, I will be just flush with happy. On one level, this book is a fairly straight-forward coming of age story about life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. It has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that I think resonates with a lot of readers. It certainly does with me and I think the adjective “charm” may have been invented to describe the novel. Despite how easing flowing the narrative is, this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race, tolerance and human decency. Most importantly, this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say “Not today, Asshole! Not on my watch.” That is a lesson that I think we can never be reminded of too often. When bad people do bad things to good people, the rest of us good people need to sack up and be counted regardless of how scary it might be. Easier said then done, I know. But at least that should be the standard to which we strive. Atticus Fitch is the epitome of that standard. He is the role model to end all role models and what is most impressive is that he comes across as such a REAL person. There is no John Wayne/Jack Bauer/Dirty Harry cavalry charging BSD machismo about him. Just a direct, unflinching, unrelenting willingness to always do what he thinks is right. As Atticus’ daughter Scout puts it so well: 
It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.
I was to make something crystal before going on because it is an important part of my love of this story. Notwithstanding this book's powerful, powerful moral message, it never once…ever…comes off as preachy or heavy handed. There is no lecture to be given here. The only sermon we are privy to is the example of Atticus Finch and the simple yet unwavering strength and quiet decency of the man. Even when asked by his daughter about the horrendous racism being displayed by the majority of the townsfolk during a critical point in the story, Atticus responds with conviction but without: 
 ""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.""
This is a special story. Oh, and as a huge bonus…it is also an absolute joy to read. Lee’s prose is silky smooth and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Read this book. Read it with your children, read it with your spouse, read it by yourself….read it the bigoted assclown that you work with or see around the neighborhood…Just make sure you read it. It is a timeless classic and one of the books that I consider a “life changer.” 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!!BONUS QUOTE: This is Scout talking to Atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of: “ ‘When they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .’ His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. ‘Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’ He turned out the light and went into Jem’s room. He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.”(Emphasis added)"
The Great Gatsby,"F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jesmyn Ward (Introduction)",3.93,"Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life”, focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. 

Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¹ - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¹ I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.
Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
“voice is full of money”
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.

The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
“an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again”
.

This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? 

Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose voices are “full of money”, who are “gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor”, people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”



This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me now, almost a full century since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you. Five green-light stars in the fog at the end of a dock.——————Also posted on my blog.","This is a good book, though it is so ridiculously overrated. There are so many great books out there that will never get the attention they deserve. They will be forgotten and their wisdom heard by only a select few who are willing to go looking for it. So it annoys me when books like this are acclaimed by critics and readers alike as the best pieces of fiction in existence (when they are not.) There’s so much more out there!Anyway, rant over. The thing I like most about The Great Gatsby is the language, the subtlety’s and the suggestions, the things that are not directly said but are said nevertheless. It’s a true feat of writing and at times it reminded me of a stage piece. The dialogue does not give the answers, but it is the character’s actions and movements (so fantastically narrated) that give the game away: it reveals their internal worlds. As such this is a book that can easily be skimmed over. The plot is basic and relatively unengaging and consequently I think an inattentive reader has a lot to miss here. It’s all about illusions and false appearances just like real life. The way people perceive us is not how we truly are and sometimes individuals actively work towards creating a desired appearance for the outside world. It’s easily done with enough time, effort and money. What Gatsby creates for the outside is a dream, an ideal life that looks perfect.However, scratch the surface and it is so very, very, clear that not everything is perfect. His supposed “happiness” is hollow and dictated by the whims of society. It is fickle, egotistical and driven by status and all the silly little symbols that go with it. His success is what society demands success to be; thus, he positions himself into a place where he can chase his true dream. In doing so Gatsby shows us that not everything is as simple as it appears, and that society driven by such monetary values is a dangerous thing because everybody is so detached from what really matters in life. (The object of his affections, for example.) I enjoyed The Great Gatsby though I certainly did not love it. Its popularity baffles me to a degree, I can think of books from the same era that deserve far more attention. Still, I enjoyed reading it and I’m glad I finally did so.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________","The Great Gatsby is your neighbor you're best friends with until you find out he's a drug dealer. It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby's competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you'll ever receive."

If Amazon ever partnered Facebook they'd own us.This is not really a review, but one of those moments where everything that was clear to you suddenly becomes utterly muddied and you really can't say what lies beneath the murky waters although a moment before you were sure you could.I'm reading Christopher Hitchen's astonishingly percipient and brilliant Arguably: Essays. I read Animal Farm too young to identify the individual animals with actual characters on the stage of communism (the old boar Major is Marx, Farmer Jones is the Tsar, the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, Stalin and Trotsky respectively) so this essay is giving me a lot to think about. So far, nothing more so than this quote (below). (Background to the quote): A group of Ukrainian and Polish refugees in a displaced persons' camp had discovered sympathetic parallels with their own plight in Orwell's parable and had begged him for permission to translate his almost-totally unknown book. But...The emotions of the American military authorities in Europe were not so easily touched. They rounded up all the copies of Animal Farm they could find and turned them over to the Red Army to be burned. The alliance between the farmers and the pigs so hauntingly described in the final pages of the novel were still in force. The book is banned in Cuba, North Korea, Burma, Iran, Kenya and most Arab countries. It is banned in the UAE not because of it's content but because it has anthropomorphic talking pigs which are unIslamic (is this not Orwellian in itself?). It is still censored in Vietnam. These nations wouldn't want ordinary people reading the book and looking at their own ruling porcine elites and seeing any parallels now would they? Who knows what kind of thoughts and actions that might lead to?Amazon and Animal FarmOn 17 July 2009, Amazon.com withdrew certain Amazon Kindle titles, including Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question. Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted. After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to Nineteen Eighty-Four itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is ""changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances."" However, Amazon does not seem to a guarantee in its ToS that they won't don't this again and I understand that authors have the ability to edit (read 'change') parts of their books. This is because you can't buy a Kindle book, only rent one and Amazon can update (read 'change') them. Wikipedia and other sourcesNext step: Fahrenheit 451. Get the firemen out to burn the books, only ebooks allowed where content can be controlled.Original review 30 Oct 2011, updated several times.","This is a book I've been meaning to read for ages but never got around to - last week I not only read it but gave a lesson on the historical context for the grade 8 class, who will be reading this book and The Wave. As I found, out of the class of 24, about 20 of them had already read the book, and at least one kid knew it was an allegory of the Russian Revolution. Still, my lesson wasn't totally redundant :)For anyone who isn't familiar with the story, Animal Farm is about the animals on a farm in England rising up against the incompetent, cruel farmer (Mr Jones, who represents the deposed Tsar, Nicholas II) and taking over the farm, renaming it Animal Farm (USSR) and - so the glorious vision intended - running it for themselves, so their lives would be better.The vision is given to them by a pig, Old Major, who dies not long afterwards. Old Major probably represents Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, and it's not the socialist ideal put forward that is critiqued by this book but how that vision is corrupted by certain other characters, namely another pig called Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin. Napoleon chases a pig called Snowball (Leon Trotsky) off the farm with his personally trained dogs (while still just the General Secretary of the Party, Stalin recruited people who would follow him blindly, so that when Lenin died in 1924 he was able to defeat Trotsky for the leadership position and his ""dogs"" kept everyone else in line).The pigs then take charge, and with their literacy skills keep changing the rules the animals established in order to suit themselves, using a pig called Squealer to convince the other animals that their memories are faulty. After all, as the drafthorse Boxer keeps saying, ""Comrade Napoleon is always right"".Boxer is - for me - the most heartbreaking character in the novel. He represents the peasants, and is the most hardworking animal on the farm. He has utter faith in the leadership of Napoleon and works himself to the bone - literally. His reward is very telling, though I don't want to give it away. Most of the characters represent either a person, several people or groups of people, and for the complete list you can check it out on Wikipedia.Orwell, while a socialist, was very cynical about Stalin's communist USSR - and for good reason! Animal Farm is a very well-written critique of how socialist ideals are corrupted by powerful people, how the uneducated masses are taken advantage of, and how the dictator or communist leaders turn into capitalists (just look at China). It's a wonderful example of how effective the allegorical style/format can be, and a well-deserved classic."

It makes them more human.01/21/2020 - 77%(1) Ron and Neville fist fight Malfoy, Crabbe & Goyle. If you ask me, Malfoy's Ron's nemesis not Harry's.(2) ""Hermione... had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.""- Pressuring idiosyncrasies is weird... like making friends dress like you.01/22/2020 - 84%(1) Filch: ""Hang you by your wrists... I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed.""- Not an awful idea, motives aside. Manacles can be handy.(2) ""Snape made them all nervous... while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.""- Trick question! Potion fumes might cause them to forget!01/23/2020 - 90%(1) The difference between J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan is that Rowling plays the long game, building scenes toward the climax. Whereas Riordan plays in short bursts, ping-ponging from one mini-quest to another. Here, for example, Ron being best at chess, Hagrid giving Harry a flute, Peeves being scared of the Bloody Baron, etc., all pay-off at the climax.01/24/2020 - 90%(1) Dumbledore: ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""- Wonder why Dumbledore doesn't give this advice to everyone? Surely people would listen.(2) Lost in the narrative is that Harry kills a guy. Literally kills him with the power of love... it's a curious thing.","Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot. She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters...) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren't stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it's all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing. I will report back on book 2 when we're done.EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:>>Aliyah wrote: ""Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular."">My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974. Followed by A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) which also centres on a magic school and which I read in 1975.The mechanics of reaching a boarding school on a dedicated train laid on for the purpose and of sorting a boarding school into four groups to be housed in four towers was something I encountered at a still younger age in the early 70s in my mother's copy of First Term at Malory Towers (1946).

Here's the Written Review!
Can you hear me screaming?As expected, the illustrations brought this book to a whole new level. I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and frame it.Each page is just bursting with new life. Honestly, how could you not love such beautiful images?Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of an odd child - much to his family's dismay.Things just... happened ...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and a whole new world opens in front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book. Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are these full-color, high quality images but there are so many of them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's pages and pages of pictures like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I strongly urge you to check out this book.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"
The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,3.80,"journal entrytoday i am 15 years old. everything is all bullshit, as usual. i can't believe how fucked everything is around me. like i'm surrounded by zombies. i can't talk to any of my so-called friends, i can't talk to jamie, i can't talk to my parents. who would bother listening anyway. i cannot wait to leave orange county! this place makes me fucking sick. everyone is a hypocrite. everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless. FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?","5.0 stars. I LOVE IT when I go into a book with low expectations and it ends up knocking me on my ass. Admittedly, this is tougher to do with ""classics"" but it certainly happened in this case. I remember first reading this in school (like many of us) and not thinking it was anything special. However, having first read it almost 25 years ago, I knew I had to read it again before I could feel justified in actually reviewing it. Of course, I didn’t hold out much hope that my feelings would change and was expecting a fairly painful reading experiece. In fact, as I started reading, I was already thinking about what my amazingly insightful, completely “isn’t it cool to bash on the classics” 1 star review was going to focus on. I thought maybe I could bag on the less than spectacular prose used by Salinger (making myself feel really smart in the process). Or maybe I could take some jabs at the less than exciting narrative pacing (and throw in a few references to ""watching paint dry""). In the end, I thought my most likely avenue for attacking reviewing this anthem of teen angst was that it was utterly yawn inspiringno longer relevant today because of the GLUT of teen angst that the recent generations have been exposed to ad nauseam growing up. I mean we live in a time in which teen angst is EVERYWHERE and even has its own sub-genre label now. You can find it in:MUSIC.........

...AND EVEN THE SHITTY POPULAR LITERATURE*** OF OUR TIMES...

 *** Literature is a serious stretch, but I must admit that these books do IN FACT fill me with ANGST!!!...So what happened to all of the preconceived notions I had before I starting reading this book? 

Instead, I found myself completely drawn into the rich, nuanced story of Holden Caulfield. I found myself empathizing with Caulfield almost from the beginning (something I did not expect to do). His ""annoying"", ""pseudo rebellious"" and ""just don't care"" exterior were so obviously manufactured and so patently hiding a seriously sad and lost boy that I was transfixed on finding the real Holden Caulfield. Despite the book being written ""in Holden's own words"" the reader was still able to discern that Holden's surface response to a situation was hiding a much deeper, emotional resposne. For Salinger to be able to infuse that kind of nuance into the sparse prose of Caulfield’s narrative was nothing short of brilliant in my opinion. Caulfied is lazy. He is stubborn. He is immature. He is unfocused. He is untruthful. He is dangerously short-sighted and he is lost in his own world or unrealistic expectations. Sounds like that could certainly be a not unsubstantial portion of the male 16 year old population. However, after reading this book, I learned a few other things about Holden that I though were fascinating and that are not as often discussed:1.	He is desperately lonely (he even goes so far as ask his cab drivers to join him for a drink);2.	He is generous with his time and his things (he writes an essay for his roommate despite being upset with him and even lets him borrow his jacket); 3.	He is extremely sensitive and longs for an emotional (rather than just a physical) commitment (he mentions several times his need to “be in love” in order to be physical and his experience with the prostitute certainly bears this out);4.	He is intelligent (despite being lazy and unfocused, Holden displays great insight and intelligence regarding books he has read and displays at the museum); and 5.	Despite being unable to process it correctly, he is full of compassion and has a deep capacity for love, which he shows most notably for his sister (this was one of the most powerful parts of the story for me as it was Holden’s desire to avoid hurting Phoebe that keeps him from running away at the end of the book).  Taking all of the good and the bad together, I was left with the feeling that Holden is an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood who is achingly afraid of the loss of his childhood and the responsibility and commitment that he sees as required to make it in the “adult” world. He is compassionate, intelligent and deeply emotional and yet is unable (or unwilling) to focus that energy on those steps that he sees as leading him away from his “happy memories of childhood” and closer to the “scary world of the adult.” I think this is superbly shown in Holden's expressed dream of wanting to being the “Catcher in the Rye.” Quick side note: I had no idea what the title to the book referred to until I just read the book. Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving into the pain and sadness that he sees as the result of becoming an adult that he wants nothing more than to spend his life protecting others from losing the innocence of childhood. Big, crazy, “I want to save the world” dreams are a wonderful part of childhood and it is a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of “you really need to grow up” rather than having such dreams transitioned and re-focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible. A great and moving reading experience and one that I give my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!","I read the end of The Catcher in the Rye the other day and found myself wanting to take Holden Caulfield by the collar and shake him really, really hard and shout at him to grow up. I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the ""insight"" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony. Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on ""the spurious coin of his own make"" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown. I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many more, unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce’s Araby: “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That’s the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we “adults” like to slosh around in. The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don’t know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the “phonies” at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the “catcher in the rye,” what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again."
The Hunger Games,Suzanne Collins,4.34,"Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*","Dystopian Perfection.  In a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the “Hunger Games”, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.I think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.*** Hunger Games (2012) is a superb adaptation, maybe as good as the book, if not better. Highly popcorn and re-watch worthy. I don’t normally reread, or feel the desire to; but lost count of how many times I’ve watched the movie on TV. It just never gets old, and is perfect, for what it is; really bringing the characters alive in a way a book never can, and few adaptations ever succeed. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson just marvelous in their roles, with an unforgettably heartbreaking performance by Amandla Stenberg as Rue too. Still, even a decade later I can never forget that Madge Undersee was left out of the adaptation; and the Tessera system hardly explained or mentioned; along with a few other minor things cut out. Not one of the greatest films but one of the greatest adaptations ever, hands down. One of those few cases where I think I ultimately prefer the movie rather than the book. Extremely Recommendable.Team Peeta btw.Also. Fatniss I’m scared! <3-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2008] [374p] [Dystopia] [YA] [4.5] [Highly Recommendable] -----------------------------------------------★★★★★ 1. The Hunger Games [4.5]★★★★★ 2. Catching Fire★★★★☆ 3. Mockingjay [3.5]----------------------------------------------- Perfección Distópica.  En un futuro post apocalíptico, la vida se ha vuelto extremadamente dura. Luchando contra la pobreza y el hambre cada día, la cazadora Katniss de dieciséis años hace todo lo humanamente posible en su poder para tener lo suficiente para su indefensa pequeña hermana, y una apenas lúcida madre. La vida es difícil, pero no imposible, hasta que un día llega el fatídico día. Una vez cada año, el siempre vigilante y todo poderoso Capitolio de Panem celebra para su entretenimiento los “Juegos del Hambre”, un evento anual en una masiva arena donde un puñado de representantes de cada distrito son forzados a lugar, hasta la muerte. En un triste giro de eventos, la joven Katniss deberԕ luchar no sólo por sí misma, sino por el futuro de su hambrienta familia.Creo que esta serie necesita tanta introducción como El Señor de los Anillos; pero qué demonios, los viejos hábitos nunca descansan. Tal vez no todos lo hayan leído, tal vez no todos lo hayan visto, pero dudo que nadie no haya escuchado hablarlo en algún momento. Una de las más grandes ficciones distópicas de toda la historia, o al menos de las que mejor vendieron ¿Una obra maestra literaria? Difícilmente ¿Una de las más entretenidas jamás? Muy probablemente. Increíble construcción de mundo y desarrollo de personajes. No una lectura muy profunda en absoluto, pero con una trama perfectamente balanceada, rápida en el ritmo y cargada de acción; si podés soportar lo Joven Adulto claro, y el coso ese del triángulo. Junto con Percy Jackson y Divergente, una de las series pilares que encendieron mi adicción literaria. Altamente Recomendable. *** Los Juegos del Hambre (2012) es una sobresaliente adaptación, tal vez tan buena como el libro, sino mejor. Altamente digna de palomitas y volver a ver una y otra vez. Normalmente nunca releo, ni siento el deseo; pero perdí la cuenta de cuántas veces he visto la película por TV. Nunca se gasta, y es perfecta, para lo que es; realmente trayendo a la vida a los personajes de una forma que un libro nunca puede, y pocas adaptaciones llegan a lograr. Jennifer Lawrence y Josh Hutcherson absolutamente maravillosos en sus roles, con una inolvidablemente desgarradora actuación de Amandla Stenberg como Rue también. Igual, incluso una década después no puedo olvidar que cortaron a Madge Undersee fuera la trama; y el sistema de las Teselas apenas explicado o mencionado; entre otras pequeñas cosas que quedaron fuera. No una de las mejores películas pero sí una de las mejores adaptaciones jamás, sin duda. Uno de esos casos donde creo que en última instancia prefiero la película sobre el libro. Extremadamente Recomendable.Equipo Peeta por cierto.-----------------------------------------------

The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,3.92,"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.","I need to start this review by stating 1) I can't stand self-help books and 2) I'm a feminist (no, I don't hate men- some men are quite awesome, but I am very conscious of women and our place in the world.)Short summary (mild spoilers): A boy named Santiago follows his 'Personal Legend' in traveling from Spain to the Pyramids in Egypt searching for treasure. Along the way, he learns 'the Language of the World' the 'Soul of the World' and discovers that the 'Soul of God' is 'his own soul.'If the statements in quotes above ('personal legend', etc) fascinate you, then you'll enjoy this book. If you think they are hokey and silly, then you'll think this is a terrible book. If you think statements such as ""When you want something, all the universe conspires you to achieve it"" and ""All things are one"" are moving and life-changing, you'll love this book. If such statements have you rolling your eyes, then this isn't your cup of tea.Its not that I find anything wrong with these messages. They are important, but must be balanced with responsibility. In my experience, 'following your dreams' (or personal legend) is not the only way toward wisdom and strength. Is the person who struggles to put food on the table every day for his or her family, consciously realizing that he or she may not be following his or her 'personal legend' any less heroic than some traveler who leaves everything and everyone he or she is responsible for to go on a spiritual quest? Coelho comes close to labeling such people, as losers in life, which I find completely off the mark as some of these people have the most to offer in terms of wisdom.The issue of responsibility is also part of this book's sexism. The main male characters in the novel have 'Personal Legends' - they are either seeking them, or have achieved them, or have failed to achieve them. But Coelho never mentions 'Personal Legend' with regard to women, other than to say that Fatima, Santiago's fiance, is 'a part of Santiago's Personal Legend."" Thats fine, but what about her own Personal Legend? Instead of traveling to find her dreams, she is content to sit around, do chores, and stare everyday at the desert to wait for his return. This is her 'fate' as a desert women. The fact that women don't have Personal Legends is even more galling considering the fact that according to Coelho, even minerals such as lead and copper have Personal Legends, allowing them to 'evolve' to something better (ie, gold).In the ideal world presented in THE ALCHEMIST, it seems that the job of men is to seek out their personal legends, leaving aside thoughts of family and responsibility, and its the job of women to let them, and pine for their return. Of course, someone has to do the unheroic, inconvenient work of taking care of the children, the animals, the elderly, the ill...If everyone simply goes off on spiritual quests, deciding they have no responsibility other than to seek their Personal Legends, no one would be taking responsibility for the unglamorous work that simply has to take place for the world to run.On the other hand, what if both men and women are allowed to struggle towards their 'Personal Legends,' and help each other as best as they can towards them, but recognize that their responsibilities may force them to defer, compromise, or even 'sacrifice' their dreams? This may seem depressing, but it isn't necessarily. Coelho seems to think that Personal Legends are fixed at childhood (or at birth, or even before) and are not changeable: they have to be followed through to the end, no matter how silly. But in my experience, many people have chosen to adjust, compromise, and even 'give up' on their dreams, only to find that life grants them something better, or they have a new, better dream to follow, a path providing greater wisdom. For me, these people have a more realistic, more humble, more fair, and less cliched vision of the world than Paulo Coelho's vision in THE ALCHEMIST.","***spoilers and bitterness ahead--be forewarned**I'm not sure that I can capture my utter disdain for this book in words, but I'll give it a shot. I read this book about three years ago and just had to re-read it for book club. It was a steaming pile of crap then and, guess what?, it's a steaming pile of crap now. The main reason I hate this book: it's trite inspirational literature dressed up as an adventure quest. You go into it thinking that it's going to be about a boy's quest for treasure. If you read the back, there are words like ""Pyramids,"" ""Gypsy,"" ""alchemist."" Turns out, this is just The Purpose Driven Life dressed up with a little fable. It's Hallmark Hall of Fame territory set in an exotic locale. Which pisses me off to no end as I normally try to dodge that sort of thing, but here it is masquerading as the type of book I normally like. It's cliche, didactic, and poorly written. Just as with Aesop's Fables, there's a moral to the story. And Coelho keeps backing up and running over it just to make sure that we get it (and he capitalizes important key words necessary to understanding it, lest we overlook their significance). If there's one thing Paulo Coelho can do, it's flog a dead horse. Essentially, boy thinks he's happy in life. He's a shepherd who gets to travel the world, has all of his needs met, and owns a book which he can always trade for another book when he goes to market. What more can a boy need? Boy is then told by a mysterious stranger that he's not happy at all. Why not? He has failed to recognize his Personal Legend. Everyone has a Personal Legend, which is life's plan for you. However, most of us give up on our Personal Legend in childhood. If you are fortunate enough to hang onto and pursue your Personal Legend, then The Soul of the World will help you obtain it. All of nature conspires to bring you luck and good fortune so that you can fulfill your destiny, whether it's to be a shepherd on a quest for treasure at the pyramids, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, or, one would assume, a prostitute, drug dealer, or porn star. Hey, we're all fate's bitch in The Alchemist. But I digress. Boy seeks out his Personal Legend and finds it's a long, hard road to obtaining what you want in life. But with faith, perseverance, and just a little goshdarnit good luck, the boy learns to speak the Language of the World and tap into The Soul of the World and fulfills his Personal Legend. And what does he learn? That what he sought was back home, the place he started from. Oh, silly boy. So, in summation, here is what you should learn from The Alchemist:1) Dream. And, while you're at it, dream BIG2) Follow your bliss3) Don't be surprised if you find obstacles in your way, but you will overcome4) It's good to travel and encounter people from other cultures5) What we most often seek is right in front of us, but sometimes we have to leave home to realize itTo all of these important life lessons, I can only say, ""Well, no shit, Sherlock."" If Coelho knew anything about alchemy, he would have been able to transform this crap into gold. Alas, it's still crap. Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"
The Handmaid's Tale,Margaret Atwood,4.15,"06/24/22These are dark times…..‘I just don’t like her.’ ‘I heard she has a lot of emails.’ ‘But I really love Bernie! If I can’t have Bernie, I’m not voting for HER… I’m going to vote my conscience!’ Elections matter. This draconian decision overturning Roe endangers every woman of child baring age, and it’s just the beginning. This decision is not about life, it’s about controlling women. As racist as this country is, it’s much more misogynistic. Don’t believe me? Barack Obama.By not voting for Hillary Clinton, whatever your reasoning, you (each of you) put lives of these women in danger. You are responsible for their deaths. It’s that straight forward. But, I understand you were misled. This does not have to stand! You have all the power and can redeem yourselves! You HAVE to vote Democratic up and down the ballot in the midterms this fall, and in every election going forward. Just two more Democratic senators is all that is needed to kill the filibuster and codify Roe into federal law.The first thing that must be done in 2023, after the Democrats control the house and the senate (because, this time you listened to me) … is to expand the court. Also, impeach those idiots that were put in by a criminal president.Pregnancy is dangerous. Women die from pregnancy. This is a healthcare issue.Vote. Vote blue. Every time. You know better, now do better.05/03/22Well, well, well….A heartfelt ‘fuck you’ to everyone who said I was over reacting in November 2016. Expand the court!Kill the filibuster!VOTE BLUE!09/01/21RE: Texas (AKA Gilead)Told you so…so many times. I could go on, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Rich, white, women will ALWAYS be able to get abortions BTW. It’s about women’s bodily sovereignty and about the men who are salivating at the thought of controlling us. Now let’s air lift EVERYTHING with a vagina out of Texas.I don’t see a difference between Republicans and the Taliban; Do you?#KillTheFilibuster #ExpandTheCourt 02/13/21Today 43 Republicans, traitors to their country, worried about losing their jobs decided against growing a pair. Portman in Ohio who isn't running for re-election is the portrait of cowardice. He could have voted guilty, but he didn't. Moscow Mitch voted 'not guilty' then immediately turned around to make a speech about how guilty Donald is for inciting the insurrection! You can't have it both ways, Mitch! Why did he vote 'not guilty?' Because of process... one can't hold a trial for a president for his crimes after he's out of office for crimes he committed while in office (yet, a president can't be held responsible for his crimes whilst in office)... But, between January 6th and the 20th, Mitch shut down the senate and refused to call the senate back to hold the trail, when according to him, would have been the appropriate time to hold the trial. All of which is entirely bullshit. Donald was impeached while he was still in office so it was entirely appropriate (required, actually) to put him on trial after he left office. My head hurts.Someone please stuff lettuce in Mitch's mouth and turn him on his shell.01/06/21Sadly, it’s time for an update. In this book, Gilead took control of the United States government via a violent coup in which they kill all the members of congress at the capitol. Then martial law was enacted. Carry on.5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about ‘life’ it’s about controlling women. If you can’t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to ‘in cases of rape and incest’ is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you’re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can’t afford more, it doesn’t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don’t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women? My stars and garters!03/31/17. So, this Russia thing.... Am I right?2/5/17.....just another giant step towards making this book a reality, like they always dreamed of.Original review written in 2o12:WARNING: This review is being written after I worked a 13 hour day, with another one on the horizon tomorrow, and a glass of wine and while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Current events have put this book on the forefront of my mind, and damn it I got to get this out. I have never written a review on The Handmaid's Tale because I love the book, and it is so hard to write about a book you love. Ehh, what the hell.OfFred was a normal everyday woman with a career, a name, a life like all women have come to expect and take for granted in this age. When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don’t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So………I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise………..icky poor women. Now it’s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I’m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I’m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote……unless that’s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It’s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don’t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it’s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said… Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I’m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I’m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to…..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the ‘other’. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don’t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio….sigh) any more than a conservative want’s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who’s right or wrong here, I’ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half…HALF… the country didn’t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don’t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) “The advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.”-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump…..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is “a goodly amount of both”, but in this election sexism won and women lost.","It's been almost five years since I wrote my review. I've rewritten large parts of it for clarity. The main idea remains the same.
Extremist Judeo-Christian beliefs have won America's culture war. Now women have no rights. They are slaves to men and the biblical, patriarchal society in which they live. The Handmaid's Tale is the first-person account of one of these enslaved women.Massachusetts Turns Into Saudi Arabia?More than thirty years have passed since The Handmaid's Tale was first published in 1985, but many still think of it as the go-to book for feminist fiction. It makes numerous ""best of"" lists, the kinds with 99 other books everyone should read before dying. Even so, The Handmaid's Tale frustrates me a lot—and not only because it contains run-on sentences and needlessly abandons quotation marks. (This is no train wreck like José Saramago's Blindness, but it's bad enough.) Simply put, if you can ignore whether you agree or disagree with Margaret Atwood's ideas about politics, religion, and women's rights, the plot and setting make no sense.The religiosity of the Reagan era inspired Atwood's dystopia, in which fundamentalist Christians have taken over society. While that premise does give me the heebie-jeebies, Atwood’s taken the idea to a literal extreme to make a point. This ruins the foundation of The Handmaid's Tale because most American fundies would balk at this world. Atwood imagines the extreme of the extreme and in the process completely misunderstands American evangelicalism. I'm a heathen bastard and no fan of religion. Fundamentalism has hurt people, particularly women, for millennia. Extremism continues to hurt people every day, especially in some parts of the world, especially in some states. Even so, it's hard to accept Atwood's dystopia when it's set in the U.S., in the near future—and in Massachusetts, one of the most progressive states in the country, one of only sixteen states in the union with state constitutional protections for abortion (since 1981, I believe). Massachusetts is a liberal bastion when it comes to American women's reproductive rights, so it's an odd setting for this brand of nightmare. In recent decades, Massachusetts is also one of the least religious states, so it's an odd setting for a theocracy, too.Atwood chose Massachusetts for its puritanical history. I can embrace the connection to the Reagan administration, in the same way I can embrace Orwell's fear of communism in 1984, but to imagine an unchanging, puritanical Massachusetts requires a bit too much. Societies Don't Change OvernightThe Handmaid's Tale is told in first person by a woman who’s lived in our present day (more or less), as well as in this dark fundamentalist Tomorrowland. She’s gone from wearing flip-flops and sundresses to a full-body religious habit, color-coded red to match her subservient role. She was married once, had a child. Now she’s another’s property, one of the handmaids sent from one man’s house to another. The hope is that she will become pregnant when a prominent man’s wife cannot. Her life has been flipped and made forfeit. She lives in fear and depression and abuse. This is meant to make me unnerved, and it does.But.Simply because an author wants to comment on society doesn’t mean he or she can ignore important, logical story elements. The logic part should be emphasized here, I think, given this is supposed to be science fiction, not fantasy. (Although Atwood does insist The Handmaid's Tale is speculative fiction, because that further legitimizes her story...or something? Never mind that sci-fi and fantasy are types of speculative fiction.)There’s a question I have that never gets answered, not properly at least. How did this happen so quickly? How did we go from ""burning bras"" to having every part of our lives regulated? Why did it take Massachusetts decades, centuries, to reject puritanism, but only a few years(?) to reject liberalism?Rights can erode, but you don’t see it happen on such a large scale and so seamlessly, and not overnight. Nothing happens overnight, especially not governmental takeovers in relatively stable, secular societies, which is the book's scenario. Societies evolve, one way or another, usually rather slowly. Civil, moral, and regime changes don't sneak up on you. It wasn't the case in Germany before Hitler, in China before Mao, in Afghanistan before the Taliban, in Syria before its civil war. It's not the case in 2016, with people like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump leading in GOP primary polls. The world may be disappointing and horrible sometimes, but it is rarely surprising.If Atwood had built her dystopia on a chain of events that occurred over a longer period of time, or explained how everything unraveled so quickly, I might have been on board with the premise. That isn't how The Handmaid's Tale is written, though. The explanations for the sudden changes are fantastical, at best, dependent on evil, digitized money—be careful with the mobile payments and bitcoins, ladies!—and misogynistic, conservative conspiracies that readers are to believe could bring millions of people to a stupefied halt and change culture in the blink of an eye. Apparently it’s easy to gun down all of Congress while it’s in session. Who knew?I don’t buy it.You can change laws all you want, but society, culture, has to be willing to follow the most drastic changes. (This is why the American Drug War has never worked, why prohibition of alcohol never worked, why banning abortion didn't work.) Why was modern American society so willing to enslave women? Atwood chucks a plot point at you here or there, hinting at a larger, more complex world through her main character. There’s a vague fertility crisis (of course). There's conflict somewhere between some people about some stuff, but details are never given. Some of this can be excused, what with the limited point of view, but not all. Plot holes aren't mysterious or clever. They're just plot holes.By the end of The Handmaid’s Tale, I feel the book is less an exploration of religious extremism and feminism than it is a narrative written for shock value. It’s an irrational feminist’s fears exposed, that the world is out to get you at every turn—especially the men, especially the women controlled and brainwashed by the men. Nowhere is safe. Overall, the summary for this book could be this: Almost anyone with a penis is mostly unfeeling and evil, deep down. (The rest are idiots, I suppose.) He doesn’t care. He will betray you at the first opportunity. Even when you're dead and gone, he will chuckle at your misfortune and demise. No, this isn’t sexist or a generalization. Of course not. Not at all.Except it is.Asides- For a slightly more accurate portrayal of American Christian fundamentalism and its very awkward relationship with women, see Hillary Jordan's

. It makes several nods to The Scarlet Letter and The Handmaid's Tale—and better understands its villains and their behavior.- Two nonfiction books, Jenny Nordberg's

, will show you what it's really like to live in a society where women are chattel.- Some think that because I dislike this book I'm not a feminist, or am a bad feminist. I hate to break it to everyone, but Margaret Atwood is not feminism's god, and The Handmaid's Tale is not a religious text. If I must attach labels to myself, feminist would be one of them, and I'll say and think whatever I damn well please. And as a feminist, I hate how one-dimensional the men are in this book, just as much as I hate how one-dimensional women are in far more books, TV shows, and movies. Deal with it. Or don't. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","I’ve been moved by books in the past, many times, but I’ve never before read a book that has emotionally drained me to such a degree. This is frightening and powerful. And sometimes it only takes a single paragraph to make you realise how much so: 
“Yes, Ma’am, I said again, forgetting. They used to have dolls, for little girls, that would talk if you pulled a string at the back; I thought I was sounding like that, voice of a monotone, voice of a doll. She probably longed to slap my face. They can hit us, there’s Scriptural precedent. But not with any implement. Only with their hands.”
Needless to say, this is an absolutely awful situation. From the very beginning, I knew how much I was going to like this book. Its story isn’t one that it is simply read: it demands to be heard. It beckoned me to see the full force of the situation. The Handmaids, the average woman, have no free will or individualism; they are treated as simple baby producing machines. An oppressive regime is forced upon them, and to deviate from the said standard results in a slow and agonising death. There’s no hope or joy for them, only perpetual subjugation. Indeed, this is where Atwood’s awe inspiringly persuasive powers reside. By portraying such a bleak situation, she is able to fully demonstrate what life could be like if we suddenly followed the misogynistic views of the old testament with fierce intensity. Women would have no power whatsoever. This would be reinforced by a complete cultural destruction and lack of any form of self-expression. They would not be able to read or write; they would not be able to speak their minds. It would even go as far as to condition them so powerfully, that they completely lack the ability of independent thought. And, to make it even worse, the women know no difference. Sure, the narrator of this remembers her past, but she’s not allowed to. She is forced to repress any sense of individual sentiment. 
“But who can remember pain, once it’s over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see. Out of sight, out of mind.” 
The narrator has a horrendous ordeal, in an equally as horrendous world. The notion was devised as a response against a drastic decrease in birth-rates. Men in power have taken complete control of women in both body and mind to insure an increase in the declining birth-rates. As I mentioned, their individualism is repressed, but the men also prevent any physical freedom. The women are owned by the state, by the men and by corruption; their bodies are nothing more than a means to provide new life. In this, they are degraded to a state of sub-human existence; they are no longer people. Atwood suggests that they are merely a reproductive organ, one that can be discarded without thought, mercy or conscience. This is reinforced on every level; the language delivers this on a revealing scale. The names are suggestive of the oppression; the protagonist is called “Offred.” She is of-Fred: she belongs to him. The women are assigned names that are not their own; they are dubbed with the disgusting title of “Handmaiden.” By doing so they are left with very little of their former lives. The women are simply objects to be used, controlled and destroyed and the slightest hint of nonconformity to such an absurd system. But, here’s the rub. The best, and most haunting, thing about this novel is its scary plausibility.The culture created is evocative of one that could actually exist. The way the men attempt to justify its existence is nothing short of terrifying. They make it sound perfectly normal. Well, not normal, but an idea that could be justified to a people. Not that it is justifiable, but the argument they present has just enough eerie resemblance to a cold, logical, response to make it seem probable in its misguided vileness. The totalitarian elements provide an image of a people that will do endure anything if they’re provided with a glimpse of liberty. The small degree of liberty the Handmaids think they have doesn’t actually exist: it’s an illusion, a trick, a shadow on the wall. They’re manipulated into believing it and become frenzied in the face of it. It is the ultimate means of control in its nastiness. 
“A rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze.”
This book was horrifying and strangely perceptive. If you’re thinking about reading this, stop thinking, just read it. It’s brilliant. It’s a book I will definitely be reading again because it is just so thought provoking and disturbing.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"
Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,4.29,"➸ 4 stars 

“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.”

— pride and prejudice by jane austen stands as a pinnacle of english literature, enchanting readers for over two centuries with its timeless tale of love, societal expectations, and personal growth. set in the genteel world of regency-era england, the story follows the spirited elizabeth bennet as she navigates the complexities of courtship, marriage, and social hierarchy. central to the story is elizabeth’s tempestuous relationship with the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, whose initial aloofness belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually wins elizabeth’s heart.one of my resolutions this year was to step out of my comfort zone and explore classic literature, and since i absolutely adore pride and prejudice (2005), i decided to start with this book. after reading this story, i can now comprehend why “pride and prejudice” has captured the hearts of so many over the years with its wit, social insight and timeless romance makes it a captivating read. i’m not sure why it wasn’t a 5 star read for me, but i think that the slow start made it a bit challenging, it was until volume three where i started to really enjoy the story.➷ austen’s language was, at first, bit of a challenge. while her prose is beautiful and rich, sometimes i would have to go back to reread a chapter to understand what was happening. but that’s just a me issue since i’m not really used to reading classics and i had to keep reminding myself this book was written over 200 years ago. but as the story progresses you can see how the writing is eloquently beautiful. watching the 2005 movie so many times definitely helped me understand everything better. 

“a lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”

➳ elizabeth bennett:elizabeth is such a strong fmc. she takes no nonsense from anyone and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. what makes elizabeth captivating is her unwavering sense of integrity and her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of pressure from her family and society. she is not willing to settle for a loveless marriage or a life of luxury if it means sacrificing her own happiness and autonomy. throughout the story, elizabeth faces numerous challenges and obstacles, from her family’s financial struggles to the pressures of societal expectations. yet, she navigates these difficulties with grace and resilience, never compromising her principles or sacrificing her sense of self. she had a tendency to be judgemental throughout the book. she quickly forms opinions about people based on limited information or first impressions. for example, she initially perceives mr. darcy as proud and arrogant, partly influenced by negative rumours that mr. wickham told her. but as the story goes on, she learns that maybe she shouldn’t be so quick to judge. — i absolutely adored her relationship with her sister, jane. they both share a special sisterly bond that is central to the story. throughout the book, they confide in each other, offer advice, and provide emotional comfort during times of joy and distress. their tight-knit bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, providing unwavering support and understanding. together, they navigate the complexities of society and matters of the heart, offering each other comfort and guidance along the way.➳ fitzwilliam darcy:「 ”dearest and loveliest elizabeth” 」opposite elizabeth bennet stands the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, a wealthy and reserved gentleman hailing from a noble lineage. initially shrouded in arrogance and reserve, darcy’s facade belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually unfolds throughout the narrative. at the beginning of the story, he is seen as arrogant and dismissive, particularly in his interactions with the bennet family. his reluctance to engage in social situations and his propensity to make quick judgments about others contribute to his unfavorable reputation. while undeniably flawed, darcy’s journey is marked by a profound transformation—one of the most compelling arcs in the story. despite his pride and acute awareness of social status, darcy emerges as a fundamentally good man, grappling with his own prejudices and ultimately learning to open his heart to love. through his struggles and growth, darcy embodies the novel’s central themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the transformative power of genuine connection.꒰ mr. darcy + elizabeth: ꒱they are the true heart of this story. the romance between mr. darcy and elizabeth bennet is a slow-burn journey that unfolds gradually throughout this book. at the outset, elizabeth is put off by darcy’s perceived arrogance and social status, while darcy is equally dismissive of elizabeth’s lower social standing and outspokenness. darcy’s letter to lizzy is a pivotal moment that shifts the dynamics of their relationship. it’s a sincere attempt by darcy to address the misunderstandings between them and explain his actions. through the letter, darcy opens up about his past and motivations, revealing a more complex and vulnerable side of himself. for lizzy, it’s a moment of reckoning, as she grapples with the new insights into darcy’s character and her own feelings towards him.darcy: i love you even though you’re poor, your family have no etiquette and they suck, but idc will you marry me?? lizzy: no like this will never not be funny!! she left that man flabbergasted, like what did he expect her to say after just insulting her and her family 😭

”in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.”

— overall, this book remains a timeless classic, cherished for it’s witty dialogue, memorable characters and enduring themes. it’s not just a romance but also a sharp critique of societal norms and expectations. through the journey of characters like elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy, jane austen offers timeless lessons about prejudice, self-discovery, personal growth and the power of love. it’s a book that is still adored and continues to resonate with readers generations later. ───♡─────────────in my classics era","""I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.""
Some of my happiest, and most looked-forward-to days of the year are the ones that I reserve for the re-reading of Pride and Prejudice. To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility: ‘if a book is well written, I always find it too short,’ explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this ‘my own darling child,’ for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It’s the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter… I’m excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it’s impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.
""But such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.""
During my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I’ve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don’t consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one’s opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I’ll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I’m certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.
""You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity.""

""Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.""

""What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?""
Starting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what makes this special is Austen’s narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there’s Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming ‘too perfect’ (like some of the Austen’s other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don’t think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that’s the first time I’ve ever said that about a book. And I don’t wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children’s books, that’s also a first for me. Sometimes it’s hard to imagine, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.
""Affectation of candour is common enough — one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.""
This second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia’s plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, that emotion has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn’t be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn’t skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.
""Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""
Until now (that is till I finish my second read), I’ve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. To be honest, I didn’t want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn’t resist sharing some of my thoughts. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it’s the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven’t watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.
“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility.

""The misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices""
As for this review, I’m going to label this as a work in progress, which I’m hoping to update after each re-read.

The Written Review
:To summarize: Mister. Darcy. *cue the long, sustained high-pitched squealing *This was truly as glorious as I remember. Every time I reread this novel, I love it more.   The

 Elizabeth Bennet  (second eldest of the five Bennet sisters) is the one with a  clear, level head.  Jane is the beautiful one, Mary is the look-at-me-I'm-so-pious one, Lydia is the I'm-so-dumb-that-I'm-probably-going-to-get-murdered one and Kitty is the well-she's-just-kinda-there one. Now, back in the day...there was one, singular goal for all women above the age of 16. GET YOURSELF A MAN  before you reach 25 and become a 
SPINSTER
 *cue high-society ladies fainting*. 
  Mrs. Bennet (their mother) has taken this so completely to heart that she thinks of nothing else. After all, 
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
 Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy moved into town and immediately Mrs. Bennett set her dasterdly plans in motion (on behalf of her mortified children). She will do whatever necessary to get a rich man to put a ring on it (oh Beyonce, your words are applicable in any century).
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
 Only, there is a snag in her otherwise flawless plans. Elizabeth is not going to roll over to whatever man is thrust her way. To her mother's ever-living-disappointment, Elizabeth has all the spunk and backbone of a truly glorious woman: 
I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
 Truly a great read, no matter the century.Plus Jane Austen is totally my soul sister.
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.



Audiobook CommentsAs with most old-timey books, It is far easier for me to listen to them than to read them. I like hearing the odd phrases and ancient unused words much more than struggling through the hard copy.

The Kite Runner,Khaled Hosseini,4.35,"Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.","In 2012, when I was Mathematics teacher at a private high school in Iran, I had an Afghan student in my class. Sometimes, I discussed with my students about literature, and I told them of novels and poem. I found it very strange that my students had no interest in literature and even sometimes looked with hostility to this discussion. Days passed and much time was left to the end of school year. One day I saw Ali, Afghan student, came to me and had a booklet in his hand and I saw in his eyes several times as if he wanted to say something, but he was quiet. I waited for a little, and after a few moments, I began to speak. He smiled, and with a special Afghan accent, he said "" I have written a story, sir "" and became quiet again. I said ""it's excellent! "", and I asked, ""do you read books? "". Yes, sir, he replied. I asked, ""what kind of books do you like? "". Mark Twain and John Steinbeck and Jules Verne, he answered. I asked what you have written? He replied I wrote a story about a 13 years old Afghan boy who immigrated to Iran. I got his booklet, and I read it in a week. It was a dark story. A week later, we discussed again after class. Ali invited me to go his house at night for reading books. I was pleased, and I greeted this plan. When night arrived, I took the kite runner and went to Ali's home. When I entered the house, I saw a house with mud walls that has no rooms, except a small hull that there was a table in the middle of it and almost nine children were dining. Of clothes of Ali's father, it was obvious that he was a building worker and he welcomed me very sincerely. I thanked him, and I went to the storehouse in the corner of the yard that Ali had made it, a place to be alone. Ali took the book and with incredible passion began to read. This process was repeated almost every night for a week, and we have read half of the Kite Runner. Among pages of the book, Ali informed me about Afghanistan, explained of how twenty people, entered Iran with a small car, illegally and secretly. Of how his classmates ridiculed him because of his Afghan accent, of how he was forced to work in a brick burner factory all days after the school, of how his dad has forced him to marry at the age of 13 in the summer. Then Ali proceeded to speak that he wants to be a writer and prizes the Nobel award. I saw in his room that he had Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Hafiz and Rumi's book poem. When I looked at his face, I saw an unusual man who was ahead of his time and situation. Ali said, because Afghans have been banned of the registration in public schools in Tehran, he is forced to register in a private school, and now he and his mother must work hard to pay school charges.The next week, I went to class, but I didn't see Ali. When I asked the guys about him, they replied that because his father hadn't citizenship card and passport, he was arrested, and all of them have deported to Afghanistan. I was agitated that I couldn't continue reading Kite Runner never. Even I felt so depressed and sad when I saw the book in bookstores. Until this spring, after three years, I got a message in WhatsApp messenger from Ali, that congratulated teachers day to me. He was written that he married to a girl who was in love with her and they have a two months old girl baby. He was written he is working at a bookstore in Kabul and he has read almost thousand books in three years. He was written they have the 4G Internet in Kabul and I replied him, it's supposed to we have 4G in Tehran as well, soon! When I received the message, I could reread the Kite Runner. It was a great book, especially for me, recall nostalgia of tired immigrants and unfavorable circumstances.*************************************سال 1391 زمانی که معلم ریاضی حق التدریس یه دبیرستان خصوصی شده بودم یه دانش اموز افغان هم سر کلاس داشتم ..هرازگاهی به بهونه های مختلف بحث رو به ادبیات میکشوندم و از رمان و شعر برای بچه ها میگفتم .. برام خیلی عجیب بود که بچه های کلاس هیچ علاقه ای به ادبیات نشون نمیدادن و گاهی حتی با دید تمسخر هم به قضیه نگاه میکردن.. روزها میگذشت و زمان زیادی به پایان سال تحصیلی باقی نمونده بود.. یک روز بعد از پایان کلاس دیدم علی محصل افغان , اومد کنار میز من و تووی دستش یه دفترچه داشت و تووی چشاش دیدم که چندبار انگار میخواست حرفی بزنه اما سکوت کرد.. کمی صبر کردم و بعد از چند لحظه سر صحبت رو باز کردم.. لبخند زد و با لهجه افغانی خاصش گفت ""اقا من یه داستان نوشتم "".و سکوت کرد.. گفتم خیلی عالیه.. پرسیدم. کتاب هم میخونی? گفت اقا بله..گفتم چی میخونی? جواب داد مارک تواین و جان اشتاین بک و ژول ورن.. گفتم چی مینویسی ..جواب داد یه رمان نوشتم درباره یه پسر سیزده ساله افغان که به ایران مهاجرت کرده. دفترچه رو از علی گرفتم و تووی یک هفته خوندم. داستان غمگین بود. یک هفته بعد دوباره بعد از کلاس با هم صحبت کردیم. علی من رو دعوت کرد که شبها به خونه شون برم و کتاب بخونیم. خب خیلی از این ��یشنهاد خوشحال شدم و استقبال کردم. شب کتاب بادبادک باز رو برداشتم و رفتم . وارد خونه که شدم دیدم یه خونه با دیوارهای کاهگلی که هیچ اتاقی نداره بجز یه پذیرایی که وسطش یه سفره انداخته بودن و هشت نه تا بچه کوچیک داشتن غذا می خوردن. پدر علی که از لباسهاش مشخص بود یه کارگر ساختمونی هست با گرمی خاصی از من استقبال کرد. من تشکر کردم و با علی رفتیم به سمت انباری کوچیکی که گوشه حیاط بود و علی از اون یه جایی برای تنها بودنش درست کرده بود. علی کتاب رو از من گرفت و با شعف خاصی مشغول خوندن شد.. تقریبا یک هفته هر شب این جریان تکرار می شد و ما نیمی از بادبادک باز رو خونده بودیم. علی لابلای صفحه های کتاب برام از افغانستان میگفت از این که چطور بیست نفر با یه سواری وارد ایران شدن ازینکه چطور بچه های کلاس اون رو بخاطر لهجه افغانی مسخره میکنن از این که عصرها بعد از مدرسه مجبوره تووی کارگاه اجر پزی کار کنه. از اینکه پدرش مجبورش میکنه که تابستون تووی سیزده سالگی ازدواج کنه.. بعد علی ادامه داد دلش میخواد نویسنده بشه و جایزه نوبل بگیره. توی اون انباری کوچیک دیدم که شاهنامه و خیام و حافظ و مولوی هم داره.. میگفت حافظ رو از بر داره و خیام رو هم.. و من توی اون نگاهش یه پسر شریف رو می دیدم که خیلی از زمان و محیط خودش جلوتر رفته بود. علی گفت چون توی مدارس دولتی نامنویسی افغانها ممنوعه مجبور شده توی یه دبیرستان خصوصی درس بخونه و حالا خودش و مادرش برای تامین این هزینه مجبورن کار کنن.. هفته بعد که باز سر کلاس رفتم علی رو ندیدم. وقتی پرسیدم بچه ها گفتن که چون پدرش کارت نداشته گرفتنش و همشون رو فرستادن افغانستان. اونقدر ناراحت شدم که دیگه سمت بادبادک باز نرفتم. حتی دیدن کتاب تووی شهرکتابا غمگینم میکرد.. تا اینکه بهار امسال بعد از سه سال پیامی از علی تووی وایبر رسید که روز معلم رو تبریک گفته بود.. نوشته بود با دختری که دوستش داره ازدواج کرده و یک دختر دوماهه داره. نوشته بود حالا در یه کتابفروشی توی کابل کار میکنه و توی این سه سال هزارتا کتاب خونده.نوشته بود ما اینجا تووی کابل اینترنت نسل چهارم داریم. براش نوشتم قراره نسل چهارم بزودی به ایران هم برسه! با رسیدن پیام علی باز تونستم به بادبادک باز نزدیک بشم .کتاب خوبی بود.. مخصوصا برای من یاداور غربت مهاجرای خسته و ناسازگاری روزگار...","This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly. Just like the spate of Native American pop fiction in the late eighties, this is overwhelmingly colonized literature, in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the 'other' culture, but on closer inspection (aside from the occasional tidbit) it is a thoroughly western story, firmly ensconced in the western tradition. Even those tidbits Hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them, one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of Afghanistan, nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, or how it formed a surrogate battleground for Russia and the United States in the Cold War, or for Colonial conflicts in the centuries before. Sadly, for all the daily news reports about Afghanistan, most people know very little of its history.Hosseini's story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised. Every convenient coincidence that could happen, does happen. He does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence, but that's hardly a replacement for a well-constructed plot. He is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years, despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict. And since the conflict does not grow or change over time, everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions.He even creates a cliched 'white devil' character, a literal sociopath (and pedophile) as the symbol for the 'evils' of the Taliban. This creates an odd conflict in the narrative, since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from Afghan tradition, itself. His indelicate inclusion of wealthy, beautiful, white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mid-east negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by small-mindedness. The fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a Disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality, which tend to be economic, not personal. The various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing Afghan conflict suggest that Hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it.Perhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of White America. It will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mid-east conflict, but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the Muslims for their 'backwards, classicist, warlike' ways. In short, it supports the condescending, parental view that many Americans already have about the rest of the world. And it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mid-east so vitally important to the future of the world.It is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this book's artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the West is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening, of what put it all into place, and of why it will continue to drag us all down. The point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent.There is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mid-east replaced by a sea-filled crater with the comment 'problem solved'. What this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the West keeps meddling in the affairs of the mid-east, and that every time we do, it creates another conflict--because almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the US and Western powers to serve our economic interests.As long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths, we can do nothing against them. We must recognize that normal people fall down these paths, and that everyone sees himself as being 'in the right'. Who is more right: the Westerner whose careless bomb kills a child, or the Muslim's that does?The point shouldn't be to separate the 'good Muslims' from the 'bad Muslims', because people aren't fundamentally good or bad. They are fundamentally people. Almost without exception, they are looking out for their future, their children, and their communities. Calling someone 'evil' merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view, and decided instead to merely hate because it's easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand.This book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.For an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's 'The Photographer'."
The da Vinci Code,Dan    Brown,3.93,"Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...","PLEASE do NOT recommend The Da Vinci Code to me because you think it's brilliant. Please do not try to explain to me that it is a ""really interesting and eye-opening book."" Just don't. Please. I've read Iain Pear, I heart Foucault's Pendulum, Dashiell Hammett is my hero, Alan Moore is My Absolute Favorite, I listen to Coil on a fairly regular basis, and cloak n' dagger secret society/Priory of Sion/Knights of Templar-tinged num nums make me a very happy girl... but if you truly believe that Brown's stupid airport thriller has ANY right whatsoever to be placed in the same category with Michael ""Wooden Dildo Dialogue"" Crichton, let alone Umberto Eco, kindly keep this opinion very far away from me, or the ensuing conversation we have will not be constructive or polite in any way.I loathe Dan Brown. I resent him for spoon-feeding the masses pseudo-intellectual ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" D-grade thriller shite under a pretense of real sophistication, and getting orally serviced by The New York Times for his effort.I'd heard that the novel was meticulously researched and contained some really interesting and controversial assessments of religious zealotry. Um, not really? Well, not by my Merovingian standards, anyway. :DLet's put it this way. If Dan Brown was teaching an Insurgent Christian Symbolism in Art and Literature 101 class at my local community college, I'd definitely have a different opinion about him. But NO. Dan Brown is not a professor of anything but pap. He is a barely competent thriller writer who wrote an AWFUL book that I could not bear to finish because I felt my IQ plummeting a little further with every ""Let's Go to Paris! Guidebook"" description and blowhard authorial essay. Oh, don't even get me started about those cute soliloquies the main characters are so fond of delivering, ever so calmly, often while cops n' bovvers are chasing them.The characters are weakly drawn. The dialogue is excruciating. The research is shoddy and self-serving at best. The plot, no matter how open-minded you are, is beyond ludicrous. It's laughable enough to be incorporated into the next Indiana Jones movie. That'd be sweet, dude.What really irks me are Dan Brown's sanctimonious interviews, wherein he shows off all of his priceless antiques while expressing his abiding convictions that the American public needs a ""deeper appreciation"" of art and history and culture. What a shallow, self-aggrandizing hypocrite. I'm all for fictional subversion of the dominant Catholic paradigm, but only if the subverter knows what the hell they're talking about. Brown DOESN'T. He's all ""la la la, connect the dots"" but the picture he comes up with is awkward and unconvincing.The DaVinci Choad is a dead easy, nay, downright lazy read, and yet droves of people are patting themselves on the back for having read and *gasp* actually understood it. Like this is some spectacular achievement? WHY? What, because the slipcover describes it as ""erudite""? Are you fucking kidding me?Don't believe the hype, kids. You are profoundly more intelligent than this holiday page-turner gives you credit for.If you really, honestly, just plain liked the book, that's cool I guess. Maybe you also prefer Anne Geddes to Alfred Stieglitz, Kenny G to Sidney Bechet, John Tesh to Igor Stravinsky. Your prerogative. Just.... please don't try to tell me that this is ""fascinating"" or ""meaningful literature"". Frickin' read The Club Dumas or something. Then we'll talk, and I won't want to shoot myself in the face.Alright, glad I purged that poison from my system. Carry on.","most of us have heard of this controverisal book. it takes an open minded person to read this and to remember it is just fiction. but it brings up a lot of important questions about the Christian church, and the loss of paganism and the respect of the Goddess or the Woman. I don't care if I am the only one who likes this book. it is my own truth, and i will think what i want to think. Dan Brown didn't LEAD me or anyone else. he OPENED our minds. simply and importantly...he was just a catalyst for different thinking. that is a good thing...poorly written or not.if you finish the book you will notice that Dan Brown even makes it clear to readers through his characters words, that he doesn't want to destroy christianity because it has done so much good for so many people, and if it works for them, let's let them continue to do what works for them. but find your own path. if you were or are a Christian ask yourself about the topics in this book. They are so eye opening. Jesus having a baby? totally possible...never thought of it before. never thought of it. is it true? who knows. Things like this are happening all the time today...Weapons of Mass destruction in Iraq? sound familiar? Maybe the church repressed information LIKE this because it was a threat to the church. totally possible. The catholic church creating the biblical canon with a political agenda to wipe out paganism? actually this seems to be a fact. women being oppressed due to the fear of religous zealot men in power losing their power...never looked at it that way. but this seems to be a fact too. is it helpful in broadening my perspective of the fact that christianity is just a religion made by fallible people. it sure is. does it open my mind to other faiths like paganism, judiasm, islam, bhuddism, and want to take the truths from all of them, and then THINK FOR MYSELF and figure out my own truth. it sure does...and that is what this book has probably done for many other people. why do you think Dan Brown's book was on the bestseller list for so long...and became a movie...obviously it was doing some good."
Lord of the Flies,William Golding,3.70,"Kids are evil. Don't you know?I've just finished rereading this book for my book club but, to be honest, I've liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school. Overall, Lord of the Flies doesn't seem to be very popular, but I've always liked the almost Hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures. Make the characters all angel-faced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have? Just your average high school drama, but set on a desert island. With a bit more bloody murder. But not that much more.In 1954, when this book was published, Britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand - that it is not, in fact, the centre of the universe, and the British Empire was not a thing of national pride, but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings. Much of British colonialism had been justified as a self-righteous mission to educate and modernise foreign ""savages"". So when put into its historical context, alongside the decolonisation movements, this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white, Western supremacy. Of course, to a modern reader there's a lot of racism in this book. The racial aspect is a big factor. Golding establishes from the very first page that Ralph is a perfect white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, private school boy. And Piggy even asks ""Which is better - to be a pack of painted n*****s like you are or to be sensible like Ralph is?"" I'm not going to argue with anyone's interpretation, but I think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism. For me, I always saw it as Golding challenging the notion of savages being dark-skinned, uneducated people from rural areas. With this book, he says screw that, I'll show you savages! and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and gold-plated upbringing.I think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says 
""I should have thought that a pack of British boys - you're all British, aren't you? - would have been able to put up a better show than that.""
 Golding's way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it.Some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book, but I don't think that's true. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel - namely, the failure of democracy and the pro-authority stance - but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach. Plus, anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination. The fascinating thing about Lord of the Flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries. You could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative Jack Merridew as a kind of Hitler (or other dictator) who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest. Dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos... we do not have to assume that Golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil, only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations.Still a fascinating book after all these years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube","I read this book a long time ago, long enough to where I barely remembered anything past the basic premise. So I picked it up again, only to wish I hadn't. There's a reason why they teach this book in middle school--in order to enjoy this book, one's intellectual cognizance must be that of a child, because otherwise you'll spend the entire time picking out everything that's wrong with the book. And there's a lot to pick out.From what little of the story that is actually coherent, I can see why this book has had a lasting effect on social commentary since it's initial publishing. The overlying illustration of how easily man can devolve back to his feral instincts is striking, yet could have been infinitesimally more effective in the hands of a decent writer. See, I would have cared a bit more about the little island society of prepubescent boys and their descent into barbarism if you know, any of the characters had been developed AT ALL. Instead, we're thrown interchangeable names of interchangeable boys who are only developed enough to conform to the basic archetypes Golding requires to hobble his little story along: The Leader, The Rebel, The Fat-Kid, The Nose-Picker, etc. Were he born in this time, I believe Golding would have done brilliantly as a scriptwriter for reality TV. And the plot? There's a plot? I'm guessing so, since things seem to happen, but it's kind of hard to tell since he spends pages describing irrelevant events that are never incorporated, characters that possibly exist yet probably don't, and using words that don't mean what he thinks they mean. And as the main characters are a bunch of kids not worth caring about, thus goes the way of the story.And the prose? Dear God, the prose! Get it away! It burns us! So yeah, this book sucked. It had potential. There were even a few parts I internally squealed at in hopeful anticipation. But whatever potential it did have was hopelessly squandered by a man who wrote like he'd never written anything before in his life. Don't waste your time.","A group of boys are stranded on a remote and deserted island. How will these boys fare away from grownups, away from society, away from rules? Written in 1954, The Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is considered a classic. The symbolism in this book is unreal especially if you consider the colors mentioned in the book (pink was mentioned 40 times). Like most people, I read this in high school, and I got a lot more out of it as an adult. At the very end, I now ponder if that actually happened or if Ralph was just imagining it (trying to avoid any spoilers here). The author who is deceased now has stated that the book can mean whatever you want it to mean so clearly everything in this review is absolutely true. If you want to check out more of my thoughts and questions raised for this book, please check out the Readalong. Thank you to everyone who participated and made this reading so much better than my first!Although this book goes down as a classic, it is rather bleak—there is very little hope or anything that can be considered uplifting. There were too many boring descriptions of the scar (more than 20+ times) and sand (more than 70+ times). As for the audiobook through Audible, William Golding, the author, is reading the book. He sounds extremely bored. I do not recommend the Audible version. Overall, I wish that I hadn’t read this as a child. It traumatized me, and I wasn’t ready for it. There is too much violence and ill will in this. Every time I would pick up a book, I would think about Piggy and feel darkness. However, as an adult, perhaps I was more prepared knowing the ending, but I also developed the sophistication to appreciation the subtleties of this book.

Fahrenheit 451,Ray Bradbury,3.97,"As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing.","Farenheit 451 has been analyzed and reinterpreted by every successive generation to change its meaning. This is chiefly because the book is full of assumptions and vague symbolism which can be taken many ways, and rarely does anyone come away from the book with the conclusion the author intended, which would suggest that it is a failed attempt.There are grounds to contend that even the title is inaccurate, since contemporary sources suggest paper combusts at 450 degrees Celsius, which in Farenheit would be more than 800 degrees. The truth is, paper combustion is gradual and dependent on many factors; even if some paper might combust at 451F, his title is at best an oversimplification, but Bradbury was more interested in a punchy message than in constructing a thoughtful and well-supported argument.It's not a book about book censorship, but a book about how TV will rot your brain. Bradbury himself has stated this again and again, as evidenced in this article which quotes Bradbury and in videos from Bradbury's own website--indeed, in an interview, he stated he was inspired to write it because he was horrified that a woman might listen to a radio while walking her dog. Not only does he patronizingly assume that she's listening to a soap opera, instead of news, or appreciating classical music, but it's a strangely anti-technology pose for a sci fi writer to take--does it really matter whether we get our art and knowledge from compressed tree pulp, or from radio transmissions?This book falls somewhat short of its satirical mark based on this cranky lawn-loving neighbor's message. Then again, it was written in the course of a few days in one long, uninterrupted slurry (mercifully edited by his publishers, but now available utterly restored). It contains archetypes, misconceptions, and an author surrogate, but can still be seen as a slighting view of authority and power, and of the way people are always willing to deceive themselves.Unfortunately, Bradbury did not seem to recognize that reading has always been the province of a minority and that television would do little to kill it. More books are written, published, and read today than at any other point in history. Most of them are just redundant filler, but so is 90% of any mass creative output, books, art, movies, or TV, as Sturgeon said. And there's nothing new about that, either: cheap, trashy novels have been a joke since the Victorian.Television is a different medium than books, and has its own strengths and weaknesses. Bradbury's critique of TV--that it will get larger, more pervasive, and become an escape for small minds--is just as true of books. As for television damaging social interaction, who is less culturally aware: the slack-jawed boy watching television or the slack-jawed boy reading one uninspired relic of genre fiction after another? I read a lot of books as a kid and watched a lot of TV, and each medium provided something different. Neither one displaced the other, since reading and watching aren't the same experience. There is an egalitarian obsession that people are all capable of being informed and intelligent. We now send everyone to college, despite the fact that for many people, college is not a viable or useful route. The same elitism that values degrees values being 'well-read', and since this is the elitism of the current power structure, it is idealized by the less fortunate subcultures. Bradbury became informed not because he read, but by what he read. He could have read a schlocky pop novel every day for life and still been as dull as the vidscreen zombies he condemns.He has mistaken the medium for the message, and his is a doubly mixed message, coming from a man who had his own TV show.","I am in 6th grade. My Language Arts teacher assigns us a book report; tells us we can choose the book but that our grade will be based on the maturity of the novel the report is based upon.My mother and I are in K-mart. I've mentioned to her about this book report to be done, and so before we leave with a basket filled with clothes I know I will be embarrassed to wear, we stop by the rack of books. She selects a few pulp paperback titles, throws them into the cart.A few days later she hands me Fahrenheit 451. ""I've read those books I purchased,"" she says. ""I think this is the best of the bunch. You should like it.""I am skeptical. When does a 12 year-old boy like anything that his mother does? I admit to myself that the cover looks really awesome - a black suited, menacing man shooting flames over something that looks like books. I give it a go.Tearing through the pages, the chapters, the three sections, I finish it over a weekend and am in awe. A fireman that starts fires? Books are outlawed? I look at the small library that I've had since childhood; a shelf of about 30 books. They now look to my 12 year old eyes as books of a child. Fahrenheit 451 is the book that launched me from childhood, my first book dealing with the adult world.I ask my mother to box up my old books and put them in the attic. I am proud to start a new library with this novel as my first edition. I carefully, lovingly, sign my name on the inside cover. Let the firemen come, I think, I am proud to be a book-reader.

I continue to read this book again and again through the years. I enroll in a college course at Penn State my freshman year, simply because this book is on the course materials. I memorized the entire poem Dover Beach because it is the selection Bradbury chose to have Montag read aloud to his wife and her friends. As the years roll by, and I age through my 20s and 30s, I noticed that fewer and fewer of the people I know read any books. Even my avid reading friends from childhood moved on to their careers, their marriages, their children. In the late 1990s a friend invited me to his house to show off a proud new purchase - a television screen the size of one of his walls. I mention how frightening this was, that he was basically mainlining Bradbury's foreshadowing. He handed me a beer and fired up Star Wars; told me to relax. I watched the movie and felt like a traitor.The last time I read F451 was about 10 years ago - I think I was afraid that if I were to pick it up again that it would diminish in its importance to me - much like Catch-22 and The Sun Also Rises. But on this first day in May I have a day-trip to Socal for business and I bring this book with me. And I love it, all over again, as if reading it for the first time. Until Beloved came along, this was my favorite book. I remember why.I joined Goodreads in 2009 with low expectations; I am not a social media person. But there was something I found here that reminded me of Montag's joining the campfire of fellow readers. We may all be from different walks of life from places all around the world, but we come here often and with excitement - because we love books. They are some of the most important things to us and our lives would be ruined without them.So to you, my fellow Goodreaders, tonight I raise a glass to each of you, and I want to say thank you thank you thank you for making my life better, for exposing me to authors I would never have known, and for reminding me that although I'll never get to all of the books I want to read in this life, I can stand on the shoulders of you giants and witness more wonders of the written word."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré (Illustrator)",4.43,"(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: A clever conjuration, it's a cozy castle mystery, a creature-fest, and Ripper-esque: lit by monsters, ghosts, and history.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:01/25/2020 - Preamble(1) Having finished ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" I'm sticking with the Stephen Fry narration. Firstly, I'm awfully OCD about having everything match. Secondly, I can't abide by British characters speaking American English.(2) Unrelated, but that glitch where we can't post reviews is back! As such, I'll be grouchy until it's fixed.01/26/2020 - 7%Notes:(1) “Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus — squiggly wiggly —”“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, “He’s doing you know what!”- I like that Harry scares Dudley with nonsense reduplication. It's more humiliating.(2) Harry gets his expulsion letter from the Ministry instantaneously. If only muggle bureaucracy worked so efficiently.01/27/2020 - 12%(1) Fred re lock-picking: ""A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick.""- I wonder if ""muggle tricks"" are performed at parties?(2) Ron: ""[Dad] works in the most boring department... The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.""- Boring? Using memory charms on muggles who've seen magic... sounds like ""Men in Black"".01/28/2020 - 25%(1) ""Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his knitted tank top.""- ""Knitted tank top""? Are you hot or are you cold, Percy? Pick one.- On second thought, I suppose that's just British for sweater vest.(2) Arthur Weasley fist fights Lucius Malfoy, mirroring Ron's fist fight with Draco in the first book.01/29/2020 - 29%(1) ""'Why,' demanded Ron, seizing [Hermione's] timetable, 'have you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?'""- Either Ron doesn't understand girls at all, or he's jealous.(2) Rowling says a lot with names. Justin Finch-Fletchley has a double-barreled surname, and as such is a mannered aristocrat. Others have emphatically ethnic names.01/30/2020 - 35%(1) Notably different from the film, Hermione doesn't know what ""mudblood"" means. Ron's actually the only one of the three who's offended by Malfoy’s slur.(2) My theory on the Ron-Hermione relationship is that Hermione's feelings for him began when he slugged himself defending her honor against Malfoy. Before that, she was all about Lockhart.01/31/2020 - 39%(1) Ron: ""Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died ... Sounds dead depressing to me.""- Ron with the puns and the common sense.(2) I think the ""Deathday"" chapter is intentionally depressing. It's all about people not getting what they want. Nick can't join the Headless Hunt, Filch can't do magic, HRH can't attend the Halloween feast.02/01/2020 - 50%(1) Hermione's blind to Lockhart's incompetence. Ron's known all along.(2) Harry: ""D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?""Ron: ""No ... Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.""- Another prudent Ron line said by Hermione in the film. Film-Hermione's given book-Ron's common sense!02/02/2020 - 53%(1) ""Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.""- The empty death threats give him thicker skin, ironically.(2) ""Hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets and other protective devices was sweeping the school.""- Sort of like trading contraband in prison... wonder how they're smuggled in?02/03/2020 - 58%(1) Nearly all of Ron's explanation to Harry about parselmouths is once again given to Hermione in the film.(2) Another fun name introduced here is ""Millicent Bulstrode,"" who is described very much like the striding bull her name evokes.(3) Harry's gone and become Hufflepuff enemy number one. Bad move ... badgers are deceptively vicious.02/04/2020 - 65%(1) Nice of Harry and Ron to return Crabbe and Goyle's shoes when they're done.(2) Malfoy insults Hermione, Ron wants to punch Malfoy. It's a law of nature.(3) Myrtle to Hermione: ""Wait till everyone finds out you’ve got a tail!""- This line was given to Ron in the film, but changed to, ""Look at your tail!"" Which, to me, sounds fairly risqué.02/05/2020 - 69%(1) Ron: ""If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work.""- Future Ron should shave often.(2) If Hagrid was expelled in third-year, and that was 50 years ago, then he'd be 63 years-old in the present, Tom Riddle would be 65, and Dumbledore around 150. I wonder if it's genetics or a side-effect of magic use that makes wizards live so long.02/06/2020 - 74%(1) Harry: ""But why’s she got to go to the library?""Ron: ""Because that’s what Hermione does ... When in doubt, go to the library.""(2) ""[Harry] chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was rubbish at them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.""- And with Hermione taking everything, it guarantees they're always together.02/07/2020 - 77%(1) Fudge sort of treats Dumbledore like a nuclear weapon: better engaged at Hogwarts than loose in the world.(2) Malfoy calls Hermione a mudblood: 'Let me at him,' Ron growled, as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. 'I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands!'- Fist fights seem an aptly muggle reflex response.02/08/2020 - 81%(1) ""The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, [Harry] thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort – even other monsters didn’t want to name it.""- Wonder if its name's just ""basilisk,"" or if it has a personal name?(2) The enchanted car reminds me of Nymeria from ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". A domestic, set free, and turned wild.02/09/2020 - 85%(1) Percy: ""Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was – well, never mind – the point is, she spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody.""- Percy should lock his door...(2) I love how, despite personal differences, the teachers all encourage Lockhart to go monster hunting, to get him out of the way.02/10/2020 - 90%(1) Myrtle: ""'I was floating away ...' She looked dreamily at Harry. 'And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever laughed at my glasses.'""- That's just short-term thinking.(2) Hermione's incapacitated, Ron stays behind. It was the reversed in the last book. They mirror each other.02/11/2020 - 97%""The Chamber of Secrets,"" as a title, always felt like a misnomer. There's nothing really secret in there. Salazar Slytherin told everyone what it was built for, what he housed in there, how to open it, and what happens if it's opened. The only thing secret about it is its location, in which case it should be called ""The Secret Chamber.""","“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” CHILLS.(REREAD)Okay DUH 5/5 stars. I actually liked this book more than I remembered! This used to be my least favorite of the Harry Potter books and, while that still might be true, I was more entertained than I expected! I always forget how different Book Ginny is from Movie Ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films.NOW ONTO HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!","JK Rowling really knows how to write a great book, thats for sure! Although this wasn't my favorite book in the series, it definitely wasn't because it was bad. I loved the plot and conflict, even though it wasn't as intense as the others were. I was definitely shocked at the end...so epic and mind blowing!"
Great Big Beautiful Life,Emily Henry,4.07,"4.25!“It’s yours,” he offers. I laugh. “Oh? I can have the world?” “Mine,” he says, “yeah. You can have mine.”
I love reading Emily Henry's books and I love reviewing her books even more. I loveeee how much I love them and I absolutely love ranting and yapping about them. This book was very different from her usual romcoms and I loved the new direction she took because honestly, I do love authors trying new things and this, not so surprisingly, worked out for Emily. I did not feel like this was misgenred because I went in knowing this was leaning more towards women's fiction than a rom-com, so I did not face that problem either and uff the comfort that Emily's writing brings me is the best feeling ever because I don’t feel like this with many authors. This was also the first Emily book for which I had to wait a whole year and I hated that because previously I had other books of hers to read and they really filled the gap of a year, but the wait was agonizing and the wait was so worth it because it fulfilled the craving that I had for this book. It's scary how well Emily Henry knows me because??? Why was everything so relatable again?!? This is voodoo shit and needs to be checked. It was certainly very new and very different, but it was also proof that trying something new can be worth it.
“Love isn’t something you can cup in your hands, and I have to believe that means it’s something that can’t ever be lost.”
Her prose is just spectacular, so addicting, and honestly I make myself slow down when I read her books because I need to digest everything and like I can only read it once for the first time, so I always savor them but the way they're so delicious—I can’t stop. It makes me feel seen, I just feel better after reading her books. If I'm having a bad day, I'll just pick up her book and it would turn my world around and this book was no different, it was a euphoric form of escapism because I would come back from uni and I would just lie down to read this and would be so lost in it. The way she wrote it was also very impressive, like how she managed Alice and Hayden's story with Margaret's book?! Truly impressive. It definitely had aspects of mystery which felt so refreshing and honestly at first, I was just reading it for Alice and Hayden's story but as the book progressed, I got more invested in Margaret's. I would say that this is not my favorite book by her because it didn't grip me from the start like her other books, I had to work my way through chapters to be invested and it is understandable to see disappointed reactions but hah, glad I'm not among them.
“When I let myself dream,” he murmurs against my ear, “or it all comes crashing down—it’s Alice, Alice on my mind. Alice all the time.”
The characters took me by surprise:Alice, was such a refreshing character, like as usual she was very relatable but I loved her determination, how much good she saw in other things, I absolutely loved her optimism and one thing I love is when characters have flawed or complex family dynamics which shape their character arc and the same happened here with Alice, with her mom neglecting her work and putting her down (which I hated so muchhhh) and her trying to prove herself—it was soo sad. The way she just wanted her profession to be valued. I loved reading her perspective and the way she viewed the world. I also really enjoyed her interactions with Margaret and how she dealt with that process was also very intriguing to see. Hayden on the other hand was a bit harder to understand and I think this was the inability of this book to obtain a second perspective—his perspective. I have only one complaint when it comes to some of Emily's books: that they don’t have the male character's perspective and I feel like having that would've elevated this book more. But as for Hayden, he was charming, the perfect amount of broody, and I loved his subtle gestures. I liked his development as the book progressed—it was truly such a wonderful experience to see him open up and deal with everything, his character also felt very realistic. That's the thing that I love in her books, she manages to capture every character of hers in this unique sense which differentiates them from her other characters but still makes them so relatable that you have to fall in love with them. I love that about her books!
“I think you live in a world that’s more interesting than the one most people live in,” he says, and just as my heart starts to sink with disappointment, with a kind of loneliness, he adds, “and I wish I could live in it too.” I feel myself beaming. “I’ll take you sometime.” “I’d like that,” he says.”
Margaret, her story was not doing it for me at the beginning but as we moved forward I got so invested in it!! Like it was so interesting and the plot twists were very well written!! I liked how it started with 'their story' and then it would say 'her story' but I loved how dysfunctional these family dynamics were and at times the family tree got a little bit too confusing but it was still very interesting to say the least. Emily knows how to write a sibling relationship like we saw it in Book Lovers and while Margaret's relationship with her sister was so well written, it was also very complex and it was written in such depth that it's very hard not to love. It was so deep, raw, and emotional. Then we got introduced to Cosmo and omg how much I loved her with Cosmo, they were everything and I fear I will never get over them!! I won’t say anything more because I want everyone to experience it themselves, it was truly brilliant writing.
“There’s an old saying about stories, and how there are always three versions of them: yours, mine, and the truth.”
The romance—besides Margaret and Cosmo—there were our main characters in this book Alice and Hayden and I loveeeed the chemistry between them, it was so intense and raw, like it was so well developed and all of it felt so natural, like the romance was not the main focus but still everything just fit right in. I was scared when I saw the early reviews talking about the romance but for me, it totally hit!! The tension between them was sizzling, how they went from rivals to lovers was so good and I liked how their interactions changed each time and how they opened up to each other. The spice was also well written and lmao I loved how horny it was and can we talk about how intense that hug was like GOD DAMN! That hug was the horniest, most intense, sexiest hug I have ever seen. I loved the romance a lot and although I wish it focused on it more, I still think it was appropriate and sufficient.
“I feel like you’re mine. Like you’re mine in a way no one else ever has been.”
The plot was very interesting, specifically because of the way it was told. Two writers fighting for one position and it was also focusing on the story that they were meant to tell and how it was overlapping with Hayden and Alice's characters. I loved how it progressed and how it concluded, I feel like it was the strength of this book and what I really liked were the plot twists—like the first one I kind of predicted but the second one shocked the fuck out of me, like I was kinda mad I didn’t figure it out before because it was right under my nose but yeah, I really loved it!Overall, I would recommend!My ratings for her books;Beach read: 5 stars!Happy place: 5 stars!Funny story: 4.75!People we meet on vacation: 4.50!Great big beautiful life: 4.25!Book lovers: 4.00!I find myself thinking that maybe every bit of heartbreak in life can be rearranged and used for something beautiful, that it doesn't really matter whether I chose this path or I was born onto it, so long as I stop and appreciate the path itself.”______SERVED, ATE AND DEVOURED_____Finally free from my exams so it's time to start this banger of a book 🤭____Secured the arc 🙂‍↕️ I still can't believe it 😭 ___That time of the year where I check my house to see where Emily Henry has installed cameras because SHE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH WRITING RELATABLE CHARACTERS-GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL LIFE 🙂‍↕️ I think im getting used to the titleIt's gonna be linked to the last great American dynasty 😔 (Buket I won't forgive you for this one)","Oh Emily… what are we doing here?? Got my hands on a pre-release (!!!), was fully prepped to be obsessed, and instead I was sitting there like—hello?? romance? anyone home??First of all: STOP. MISGENRING. BOOKS.I don’t care how beautiful the prose is (and yes, the writing was gorgeous)—this book is being sold as a romance. It is not a romance. This was women’s fiction with mystery sprinkles and a dry slow-burn subplot that didn’t even simmer. And I say this as someone who eats up slow burns like it’s my full-time job.THE PREMISE?10/10. Two writers competing to write a juicy biography about a missing heiress with an NDA and some forced proximity? HELLO, SIGN ME UP.THE EXECUTION?3/10. It got so bogged down in Margaret Ives and her family’s drama that the entire romance thread between Alice and Hayden became background noise. Beige. Blurry. Basically invisible.Alice was the classic “sunshine with big dreams” type, but with all the sparkle of a soggy saltine. Hayden, the grumpy Pulitzer-winning grump, had the emotional depth of a half-written poem. Did I want to love them? YES. Did I ever really see them fall in love? NOPE. Not even a little.One minute it’s “Who even is this man?” and the next it’s “I love him.”Girl, where? WHEN? Did I blink and miss the entire emotional arc???Margaret’s story… whew.Boring. Predictable. At one point I swear the book forgot who the main characters were supposed to be. We spent 80% of the book digging through Margaret’s lineage like it was an ancestry.com deep dive and somehow forgot to make her interesting?? I needed glamour, secrets, drama. All I got was a slow drip of exposition and one ridiculous twist that made me want to fling the book across the beach.The romance.Forced proximity with zero actual chemistry? Check.Sexual tension that felt like two magnets trying to repel each other? Check.Cringe spice scenes I literally skipped because I couldn’t handle secondhand embarrassment? Unfortunately, check.Hayden went from stone cold silence to trauma dumping in monologues that felt like rejected Oscar speeches. And Alice just stood there being quirky and mildly confused. Girl SAME.And the ending? OH THE ENDING.It tried to become a full-on mystery novel with plot twists flying in from left field like it was auditioning for a new genre entirely. I was so confused I had to reread pages just to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Spoiler: I hadn’t. It was just That. Random.BUT LISTEN.I didn’t hate it. I flew through the book. Emily’s writing is undeniably magnetic. Some lines had me gasping, others had me giggling, and there were a few moments of pure ✨magic✨. The small-town beach setting? A vibe. Hayden’s grumpiness? Initially attractive. The potential? THROUGH THE ROOF.But ultimately?This wasn’t a romance.This wasn’t emotionally satisfying.This wasn’t the Emily Henry book I waited all year for.If this had been marketed as a women’s fiction novel with literary ambitions and a dash of romance, I’d be like “cool cool, let’s unpack.” But calling this a romance is misleading, and for me, that disconnect colored the entire experience.I wanted swoony Emily Henry banter and high-stakes tension. I got family trees and trauma.Give me Hayden and Alice as enemies-to-lovers, cooped up in a cottage, battling for biographer glory with banter and kisses and “oh no there’s only one bed”—THAT’S the book I thought I was reading.Instead, I got chapters on generational guilt, a dead romance, and a biographer battle that had no real stakes.FINAL THOUGHTS:
3 stars.
A gorgeous mess with a broken heart and a beautiful typewriter.Loved the vibe. Hated the bait and switch. Still a fan. Just… sad.EmHen, you’re still my girl. I just miss the kissing, yearning, and banter that made me scream into my pillow—in the best way.",I’d heard SUCH mixed reviews on this book before starting it so I’m SO pleasantly surprised that I LOVEDDDDD IT!! I always love Emily Henry’s romances but I especially loved Margaret’s story (which I know a lot of people found to move slow). This book truly felt like an Emily Henry rom com 🤝 meets The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.AND THE ENDING! Never ever saw it coming. I teared up twice 😭 soooo good. And of course I loved the romance 💗🤭 a new top 3 Emily Henry book

Let’s just say, if he were a cocktail, he’d be straight-up whiskey—strong, fiery, and not afraid to put you on your ass if you’re not careful.

Passion Project,London Sperry,3.87,"3.75 ⭐️ The perfect NYC setting rom-com vibes!!!! Henry is also ✨ perfect ✨ (very good with communication & a very wonderful listener)I also loved the depiction of mental health & grief through our FMC, her personality was relatable but also fun! I didn’t completely feel the romance, but I’m glad they found each other when and how they did!!! This was almost a sold 4 ⭐️, but the veryyyyy ending scene(s) knocked it down just a tad","˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 3.75 Stars . ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗So, I really loved this one and I'm sure tons of people will - it feels literally impossible to not fall in love with both Bennet and Henry and the New York City magic that was poured into these pages. Bennet Taylor is stuck in grief after the death of her first love. Hoping to rediscover herself and honor Sam’s dreams, she moves to New York—but all it brings is a sense of rejection and lingering depression.In an effort to improve her mental health, her friend encourages her to go on a date with a guy from a dating app. But the closer Bennet gets to the meeting place, the stronger the panic becomes. She runs into a restaurant across the street—unaware that she’ll run into him there later.Right from the first page I was pulled into the story - Bennet just popped off the page for me and I could really relate to all the mishaps she had going on so early on it the story lol. I myself have lost a significant other and could totally relate to how she was feeling and how her life seemed so unmanageable and depressing.Once Bennet and Henry start hanging out though to do their little Passion Project oh my god the chemistry and the banter just came to life. I found myself laughing so often and to the point where I was tearing up. I absolutely loved everything between these two. The writing is beautiful and I thought the pace was great as well.. The author really brings the heart of NYC to you in these pages with such vivid detail. If you love the city and need a quick mental get away, London Sperry will get you there in this novel, lol I promise you that. I was truly transported into the concrete jungle of cement with this one.After around the 60% mark there's a couple of conflicts that I didn't really like or think were necessary. This really would have been a 5-star book for me but I'm team Henry forever and I just didn't like the way he was treated. I don't often round my ratings up, but for this one I will after chatting with my reading partner I've decided not to round. I was just too disappointed with Bennet's behavior in the last few chapters.(cont from the edit) ...because I did love the majority of the book, but I loathed two scenarios. The last conflict didn't leave me with the warmest or fuzziest feeling and instead of loving Bennet as I did for the entire book up until this point, I started to see her in a less favorable light.This is an absolutely beautiful exploration of love after loss and healing during the grieving process. The romance is sweet and fun, it's tender and heartwarming and I just know these two will steal many readers hearts.If you loved Promise Me Sunshine - I think you'll love this one. Highly recommend. 💜Cinnamon Roll MMC💜NYC Setting💜Overcoming Grief💜Love After Loss💜Slow Burn💜Grumpy x Sunshine💜Friends to Lovers💜Only One BedExpected Pub Date - 04/08/25Buddy read with my girlie pop bestie Maria - Please be sure to check out her thoughts as well! 💛💐⋆✴︎˚｡⋆ Connect with me on Instagram ˗ˏˋ★‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹ Many thanks to Penguin Group for the advanced digital copy.

So I had to lower my rating😌Passion Project follows Bennet Taylor, a temp worker in New York City who’s stuck in a rut—grieving the loss of her first love and feeling disconnected from everything, including herself. After a chance encounter with Henry Adams, whom she had recently stood up for a date, Bennet makes a tipsy confession: she hasn’t felt passionate about anything in years. Instead of walking away, Henry proposes a plan to help her rediscover excitement in life by trying something new together every Saturday. As their “passion project” unfolds, so does their connection, forcing Bennet to confront her grief, her fears, and the question of whether she’s ready to truly move on.➳ 
my thoughts:
This book was going really well, it was 5 stars material until the last 20%. Nonetheless I think this was a really stable debut. To start, the writing in this book was beautiful. It was effortlessly readable, with the words flowing so smoothly that it felt like I was being carried through the story without even trying. This is the kind of book that doesn’t feel like a chore to read, not until around the 80% mark lol. Up until then, I was completely absorbed.I loved how vivid the nyc setting is, the mentions of the places, how it describes the city. it was just very pleasant to read about. It made me want to hop on the train and go to where the characters went. The author describes this book as a love letter to the city and it really feels like that. The dynamic between the characters was enjoyable and entertaining for the most part.・❥・ Bennet’s character development was really well done—at least during the phase when she and Henry were still building their friendship. It felt genuine and promising, like she was slowly healing and learning how to open up. But once they started dating, it was as if all of that growth just vanished. It almost felt like everything she had worked through was undone, and she reverted back to square one. Honestly, she clearly wasn’t in a place where she could truly commit to a relationship, and it showed.At this point, I kind of have personal beef with her—seriously, lmao. There were moments when her actions felt manipulative, especially toward Henry. If he got upset or even just slightly hurt by something she said or did, she would immediately bring up her grief and the difficult years she’s been through. And look, I totally understand that depression and grief are incredibly hard to navigate, and they don’t just disappear—but I didn’t like how she weaponized her pain to make Henry feel guilty. It was like he always ended up being the one to apologize, even when he hadn’t done anything wrong. It just didn’t sit right with me. This girl needed to go to a therapist asap, she should have cared more about it than getting a new boyfriend. This book is obviously more about Bennet than Henry so we don’t see too much about his character imo, which is sad because he is a really good mmc. ・❥・ Another major complaint I have about this book is that Henry genuinely deserved so much better than Bennet, and the conflict at the end only solidified that for me. There was this one situation where Bennet basically showed that she had never truly moved on from her late ex. In doing so, she hurt Henry, who had been nothing but patient and supportive throughout their relationship. What frustrated me the most, though, wasn’t just the conflict itself—it was how the entire situation was resolved.The resolution felt incredibly rushed. Bennet suddenly seemed to “get over” her dead ex overnight, without any real emotional unpacking or growth shown on the page. And the worst part? She didn’t even grovel!!!!😭 Like, not even a proper apology or genuine moment of accountability for the pain she caused Henry—just a quick emotional turnaround in the last chapter, and we’re supposed to believe everything’s fine? I really wish the author had taken more time to explore the aftermath of that moment and given us a resolution that felt more earned and meaningful. Because the way it ended, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Bennet was never going to love Henry the way he deserved to be loved.・❥・ The ending was honestly very underwhelming and left me feeling nothing. I wanted to be moved, to feel some sort of emotional payoff but instead, it just fell flat. Bennet’s love confession didn’t hit the way it was probably meant to—it was completely overshadowed by the weight of the previous conflict. By the time she gave her big speech about love, I just couldn’t bring myself to care.Instead of feeling touched or happy for them, I was still stuck on how poorly she treated Henry. Her words felt empty because they lacked the emotional groundwork needed to make them believable. I was just sulking through that whole final scene, thinking about how Henry deserved so much more than half-hearted apologies and rushed declarations. It was supposed to be a romantic and satisfying conclusion, but for me, it just didn’t deliver.overall: I know it sounds like I hated the book but I was really into it and loving it until the third act breakup. I’m sure that a lot of people are going to absolutely love it, and my problems with the book were personal so everyone should give it a shot and read it. This is very similar to promise me sunshine by Cara bastone which was a plus for me because that is one of my favorites book but the execution at the end in this one failed me.

Swept Away,Beth O'Leary,3.65,I’ll spend my life chasing the high of the flatshare,"˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 2.5 𝕊𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕤 - ℝ𝕠𝕦𝕟𝕕𝕖𝕕 𝕥𝕠 3 𝕗𝕠𝕣 𝕥𝕙𝕖 ℂ𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕣 ˗ˏˋ★‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹We follow our FMC Lexi and our MMC Zeke as they meet one night by chance at a bar, go back to his house boat for a one-night stand. In a miscommunication, the boat isn't tied to the dock and the two wake up drifted out and lost at sea.I want to start by saying, this isn't really my type of romance... Sigh. I should know this by now, but please understand that these covers get me all the time lol.I think that this would be a good beach read or pool side book. Meaning there's not a ton of substance, most of the events that happen wouldn't really happen. I mean, sure you could get lost at sea, but I don't think if you or I got lost at sea that we'd be concerned with 'saving a seagull' who is literally in their element at sea. Or say, getting drunk and dehydrated af when you have limited supplies and again... Are lost at sea! I am all about drinking while in despair lol but this is a life-or-death type situation and it was treated like oh he he haha. I know, I know that this is a romcom of sorts and it's totally fictional but it just makes it hard to relate to the characters when they're in a situation and doing all kinds of things I would personally never do. This is an age gap romance and I felt uncomfortable with how much Lexi would ogle him while going ""but he's basically a child!"" And his first sexual experience / ""relationship"" was with an adult while he was 16? And Lexi just ignores that this is...abuse? and thinks he's just into older women? Like maybe we should unpack that trauma instead of thinking it funny. He feels too young and childlike in comparison to her, and power difference of age made me uncomfortable.I run into this often when authors do a reverse age gap, I find that the 'older woman' can sometimes come across kinda predatory depending on the way the character is written and I wouldn't say that Lexi necessarily came across as a predator to me in this book lol bc she didn't but she did give me a bit of the ick. There's plenty of lines and scenes throughout the book that I know were intended to be laugh out loud moments, but I read the entire book with a straight face. Take from that what you will.All in all, I do think if you're looking for something to read while at the beach for the afternoon and you don't want anything too serious (even though they're stranded at sea, it's not really high stakes vibes) it's worth a read.

It won’t go down as one of my favorite trips, but I have no regrets!Thirty-one year old Lexi has put her own life on hold for the sake of her best friend/de facto “sister” Penny’s four-year-old daughter Mae, who she helps care for and all but sees as her own. When her boss Marissa sees a cute young man at the pub, she encourages Lexi to put herself first for a change and have a little fun. Twenty-three-year-old Zeke has spent his life believing his recently deceased dad isn’t his biological dad and copes by sleeping around. With therapy, he’s trying to turn over a new leaf and find true love. Then he sees Lexi. Rules are meant to be broken, right?After a night of drinking and a “no strings attached” one-night stand on a houseboat, Lexi and Zeke wake up and he offers to walk her home - only there’s a snafu. After a mistake in mooring the boat in the fog the night before, it’s now adrift on the ocean with no land in sight!This begins a twelve day journey fraught with dwindling supplies, leaks, storms and no land or rescue in sight, not to mention some physical mishaps that put both of them in further danger.I’ll break down what did and didn’t work for me because, to be honest with you, reading this wasn’t smooth sailing for me any more than it was for our main couple!What worked:● Character growth. After a rough start, where I very nearly DNF’d this due to the shallowness of both characters, it was nice to see them become more vulnerable and real as the story progressed. Their edges were smoothed nicely.● A clever premise. I’ve never seen this scenario in a romance, so it was fun to see how it would play out trying to build a romance in such a perilous predicament. ● Emotional depth. The exploration of grief (both characters lost a parent) and overcoming dysfunctional patterns helped make the MCs more sympathetic and relatable over time.● A sweet ending. It's a bit of a buy-in, but what the heck? I’ll bite. 😊Where I struggled:∅ Insta-love. I could never buy into the deep connection and chemistry Zeke and Lexi had based on so little knowledge of each other. Zeke, particularly, had what felt like an unbalanced attraction to Lexi after sleeping with her one time. It felt a little ooky at first!∅ Unhealthy attachment. Is it just me, or did anyone else find Lexi’s attachment to Mae a bit unbalanced too? I get that she helped raise Penny’s daughter, but she spoke of Mae as if she was her own daughter and as if her life revolved around the child. She was “Aunt Lexi”, but it felt like those maternal lines were blurred for her.∅ Believability. For two people who didn’t know they’d be lost at sea, it felt like they conveniently always had everything they needed. I never felt an extreme sense of danger, because Zeke was whipping up meals for them the entire time!Anyways, true to the book there were some rough spots on this trip I had to get past, but I’m pretty happy with where it landed. If you like romance with some adventure and mild peril, this might be a fun one for you! ★★★ ½ Thanks to Berkley Publishing, NetGalley and author Beth O’Leary for this digital ARC to honestly review. It’s out on April 1, 2025."
Boys with Sharp Teeth,Jenni Howell,3.22,glances at cover...oh nice...pretty little liars meets THE RAVEN BOYS!!!!OH NOICE!!!!!!,"𝗗𝗡𝗙-ed this one ,unfortunately . Between the looming exams turning my brain into a scrambled mess and this book feeling like trying to navigate a labryinth blindfolded ,I had to tap out ,the narrative felt really messy and disorganized ,and honestly ,my mental energy is currently reserved for trying to remember complex infos ,not untangling a chaotic plot.Maybe in a less brain-fried state I could appreciate it ,but right now ,it was just adding to the overwhelm.","The roaring engines and the tension from Summer Sons meet the mirrors from Beholder in this eerie and thrilling young adult dark academia story.Where Graves is stone and lightning, Henry is softer, slipperier, a boy I’m never quite sure if he’s there to save me or because he likes watching me struggle. Okay, first of all, this is not a romance, not even close. There’s so much attraction and repulsion without knowing if there’s a sexual charge underneath that it made me gasp for air and want to read on and on and on. Eyes lock, fingers brush, bodies touch until the tension is almost unbearable, but there’s never a sweet kiss, a shiver out of anticipation, a smile of recognition. This story is twisted and obsessive and sooo addictive.The movement brushes my hair against his cheek and lets his breath tickle my ear.Jenni Howell’s writing is phenomenal, lush, and feverish, as if it were screaming in capital letters. Sometimes, I was wondering what the eff I was reading and where it would lead to, IF it would lead to something. But at the same time, I didn’t care because I highlighted so many passages and felt the constant thrill tugging at my heart. Graves’s mouth moves, but I can’t hear him, all I can hear is the engine’s roar and the violins’ whine and then there’s Henry, his hand moving to mine.Jenni said either you’re team Henry or team Graves, and I think she’s right. I had a soft spot for the violin-playing, wicked smart boy seeming to be made of stone, but he felt so much softer on the inside to me, constantly hiding his true self. I can feel his eyes on me, reminding me of every time he’s had me inside out, splayed across the table in front of him. He says nothing.This book grips you at your throat and tries to suffocate you, so you probably end up loving or hating it. But that’s exactly what this story is about. Hate is not that far from love, after all. I’m a lover and can’t wait for what Jenni Howell has in store for us next! Thank you so much, Tatiana from Fiercereads, for letting me read this story. It’s fantastic and I will gush about it as much as I can!  Follow me on Instagram"
House of Blight,Maxym M. Martineau,3.88,"✩ 4 stars ✩ What to Expect:➼ Forced Proximity➼ Love Triangle ➼ Training Scenes➼ Healing Magic➼ Beast Forms➼ Dark Secrets ➼ Feminine Rage➼ Complex Family Dynamics➼ Gothic Fantasy➼ First Person POVI’m generally not that enthralled by gothic tales, but this was one of the best I’ve read! Edira was a strong female lead, doing her best to navigate the secrets of the Fernglove family as she worked to develop her powers. The selfless characters are always my favorite and all of Edira’s choices were made with her brothers in mind. At first glance the castle seems ethereal and pristine, but things are not what they seem. Bit by bit, she slowly peels back the layers and uncovers the truth. The entire cast of characters were very well developed and I was intrigued from the start by both the magic system and the plot. The gothic vibes of Fernglove Manor were expertly crafted and this was one of the rare instances that I felt the love triangle actually furthered and benefitted the plot. I did draw some parallels to other popular books, but I would still describe this as a very unique story. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a gothic tale and maybe even some like me who don’t! I’m excited to read book two as I expect it to deliver some delicious slow burn tension. 🤌🏻 Add this one to your TBR friends!Thank you to Libro.FM for the ALC in exchange for an honest review. ✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼Pre-Read: I got the ALC!

Reminded me of the family in ""A Winter's Promise,"" but at least some of them turned out good in the end.By the end, I was shouting, ""How could you trust them?"" Then I realized I'm kinda like that too, so I get her.I loved how the Fernglove family's magic hides someone with wings, horns, and tails.By the end, the plot had me hooked; I couldn't sit still!I felt a bit detached from the characters, but that's just me. Can't wait for part two!A girl with the magical power to heal at the cost of her own life threads, a family needing healing, brothers who are infected—everyone has the same goal, but there are always sacrifices.

The Notorious Virtues,Alwyn Hamilton,4.23,i don't know what this is but i'll read anything alwyn hamilton writes,"One day, I'll stop adding books to my TBR based entirely on their glorious covers. This is not that day.Update-is this book even going to released anymore? It doesn't appear anywhere (on Amazon, Barnes & Nobles, Etc.) and it no longer has a release date. Does anyone know the deal with this?","Sooo...when is this book ACTUALLY releasing???- Amazon says 4 January 2050- Book Depository says 1 June 2021- IndieBound says 4 January 2050- Waterstones says 18 August 2020- and it's disappeared from Barnes & Noble's websiteWHAT IS GOING ON??? Goodreads also says 18 August 2020, so I'm rather confused..."
The Wind Weaver,Julie   Johnson,4.02,"Thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for an advanced copy of this book for an honest review!I’m not happy with this rating for an ARC and know that I don’t give this rating easily but I need to be honest. Sadly, this is a DNF for me at 60% as this 1) despicably failed the Bechdel Test and 2) had no plot whatsoever. This is a 500 pages book. Meaning I’ve read a little over 300 pages. The plot should’ve already been mentioned and moving by now. It would’ve benefited being cut from at least 150 pages. I’m actually a whole lot tired of having fierce/snarky personality 20yo FMC who are painted as ignorant. The ignorance made her seem naive and completely unintelligent. And BTW - the FMC is the only woman focus for 53% of the book !!! And then we FINALLY meet another woman but she’s a complete mean girl and refers to the FMC as ‘whore’… I thought we were over this. It despicably failed the Bechdel Test and I wish it was marketed as having only one woman because this isn’t enough. I’m sure other readers will feel the same way I did ; I need female friendships. She’s kind of painted as one of the guys at some point and I guess that’s what the author wanted to focus on but Adult women friendships are absolutely necessary. It feels useless for me to read a book that doesn’t have them. It’s always disappointing for me because I always feel like those types of books are a setback in the Adult genre. There’s a gigantic info dump at 40% in form of conversations and it doesn’t move us anywhere along a plot of some kind. There is a random display of jealousy at the 44% mark that rubbed me the wrong way. Especially considering the romance in this Romantasy lacked chemistry on whole new levels. In conclusion, I do think this needs adjustment to appeal to Adult readers. This might be more suitable for 12-13yo. I was rather enjoying the first 12% but then it got tedious and repetitive and mixed with all that is mentioned ; just felt like a big fiasco.","✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦

I loved that this book griped me from the start with action-packed scenes, lush imagery and beautiful prose. I am a HUGE fan of books that don’t give you all the details up front so it was a lot of fun to have that mystery/unknown aspect, as our FMC learns more about herself and her world. This was such an epic start to a new trilogy and I cannot wait to see where it goes from here. ps This is the start of something great… What I loved…- action-packed, fast-paced, and great overall pacing - lush imagery that made you feel like you were right there in the thick of it with the characters- mystery/intrigue, single POV so you learn about the world as the FMC does- the plot REVEALS and twists were heart pounding and epic! - crazy beasts and magical creatures - thorough world building with minimal info-dumps - the romantic sub-plot was top notch, SLOW burn & high tension 10/10- Found family, the side characters were A++ - Grade A++ banter (not just with the MMC, but with the side characters too!) - elemental magic, chosen one, and an ancient prophecyWhat I didn’t love… - longer chapters (look I’m just not a fan ok)- at times the romance veered a tiny itty bitty bit into the cheesy lane - but most will probably love it- while the overall pacing was excellent there was a bit of a lull around the 60-80% mark - the longer chapters combined with the super fast paced beginning made the slow down (to do important things like finish fleshing out the world and character development) a bit more noticeable. 🌶️ - I gave this one chili based on my old style of describing spice but I will go back and update this with chapters and type of content soon. Thank you NetGalley and Berkley (Ace) Publishing for sending this book (eARC) for review consideration. All opinions are my own."
Flirting Lessons,Jasmine Guillory,3.47,"First of all, can we all just appreciate this gorgeous cover 😍?! It's giving queer Shall We Dance or Dirty Dancing vibes 💃If I'm being honest though, the cover of this book is far sexier than the story itself. Told in 3rd person, in dual POVs, the story follows Avery and Taylor. Avery just got out of a relationship and is interested in dating women but doesn't know where to start because she doesn't have a lot of dating experience and has never been with a woman. Meanwhile, Taylor (who never backs down from a bet) bets that she can totally make it through the summer without sleeping with anyone. To keep herself distracted, she offers to give Avery ""flirting lessons"" and tries to keep their relationship platonic despite the growing attraction between the two. As much as I loved the cover of the book and the premise of the story, I was really close to DNF'ing this book on multiple occasions because of the writing style and bland characters. My primary issue is with the writing style. Perhaps it's the formatting of the eARC, which will hopefully be resolved at final publishing, but I found the sudden mid-page POV switch (with no advance warning) jarring and confusing. I spent the first few chapters constantly getting Avery and Taylor mixed up. Not only that but despite the profanity and sex scenes, the writing style was very stilted and felt very juvenile. Take the following as an example:
""Taylor was weirdly distracted by watching Avery and her partner. Why did that distract her so much? She had to focus.""
and
""Taylor didn't say anything for a minute. She could tell it had been hard for Avery to tell her that. It felt good that Avery could be honest with her.""
This writing style lacks subtlety and reminds me of many middle-school books that I've read, in which everything is written in short stilted sentences, where every character interaction includes a lengthy monologue, and the entire book is written as if the readers are too dumb to read between the lines and figure out the characters' feelings and intentions. I think these issues would be easily resolved if the book was written in first person instead. As for the romance, aside from the fact that they're both physically attracted to each other, there's very little to indicate that Avery and Taylor's attraction goes beyond thinking that the other person is hot. There are constant reminders of how sexy or pretty they think of each other but nothing more.Finally, the characters were underdeveloped and their character development was rather underwhelming. Avery's entire personality is that she's introverted and likely has anxiety while Taylor's entire personality is that she's a flirt who has probably slept with every lesbian in Napa Valley and has the power to flirt the pants off any woman. Also, every single character is overly chatty, tends to ramble a lot, and all talk the same way/have the same personalities. It also seems like everyone's personality (both main characters and secondary characters) is based on whether or not they're in a relationship. It's weird. This book would have been a 1-star read but I'm giving this book an extra star because it provided pretty solid advice (especially for introverts like me) on how to meet new people, make new friends, and flirt with people you're attracted to. I think I would've loved this book if it were a rom-com told in alternating first-person POVs. There was so much potential to inject humour in the flirting lessons or in the interactions between the two FMCs. Overall, I feel like this book needs a complete rewrite and heavy editing. The story is there and the characters have some potential, but they need to be fleshed out more, and the dialogue and writing flow need to be reworked. *All quotes are taken from an Advanced Readers Copy and may change prior to the release of the final copy.***I received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley for review consideration, but all opinions are my own.*****

Taylor and Avery were so cute together and I loved that their relationship was built around a friendship and so much banter and teasing.

Any Trope but You,Victoria Lavine,3.94,"On the one hand, I did have some fun with this one. But on the other hand, shouldn't these characters be in therapy instead of a romcom?Let me preface this by saying that my opinion here is decidedly in the minority. I see so much love for this book, so I'm inclined to think this is probably a me-problem and not a book-problem. I'm getting to that cynical old age when I should stop reading romances about silly young 'uns and move onto more serious novels about geriatric leads.But since you're still here, I might as well tell you my thoughts.First, the good. The premise of this book is a lot of fun, about a romance author all romanced-out and pretending for her readers. There is a lot of trope awareness within the pages, so it almost feels a bit meta as you're reading it. I also thought the banter was top notch, and it definitely had me chuckling along.But then, the not so good. I feel like this book took every possible minor issue that the characters could have had and laid it on so thick, it robbed any semblance of reality from the story. Find out your favorite romance author doesn't believe in happily ever after? Cancel her. Caring for an ill loved one? Why not make it almost Munchausen by proxy. Love someone but can't physically be in the same location? Don't even consider long distance, just call it quits and wallow in self-pity.It's hard to take a story seriously when it's so over the top on everything. I understand that to have a story at all, there needs to be conflicts and resolutions. And yes, sometimes one has to stretch the conflicts a bit in order to have a story last the requisite 300 pages to be called a book. But this one went so hard to town with just about everything, it started to feel vaguely farcical.And this nuttiness extended to the characters too. At the center is Margot, the most beautiful and successful female lead ever, yet so full of self-doubt that she needs constant reassurance from everyone around her, which she manifests as rudeness and brattiness and borderline harassment. 
""No, Forrest, you listen. You gave me every indication that you were interested. I thought maybe we could have a little fun in this godforsaken place, but since that's obviously not something you're capable of, I'm happy to find it somewhere else.""
Yikes, talk about a red flag! Then there is Forrest, yet another one of those doormat male leads, existing solely to fall in love with and bolster up our female lead, no matter how poorly she behaves. I cringed so hard in embarrassment for them both, my cheeks were permanently pink while reading this.And the cherry on top? They were both caring for ill loved ones, but to a degree that was so extreme, these said loved ones had to formulate complicated plans to extricate themselves from this unwelcome, excessive style of smothering and guilt/self-conflagration. My eyes rolleth out of my head, my friends.At its core, in order for me to buy into a romance, I have to believe that people can fall in love with the main characters, and it just didn't happen here. It's one thing to suspend disbelief, and I'm happy to do so for pretty much every book I read. But the way Margot and Forrest were written, they were just a step too far beyond disbelief for me. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・𝓟𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⤿🎿28/02/253.75 stars ok lowkey I didn't expect to enjoy this? because all my arcs recntly were letting me down, but this one did the job!!😌🙌🏻 Despite liking it, I feel like there could've been more to the end, as I felt the ending was rushed.

Wish me luck 🤞🏻","3.75 stars! ﻿🌟 Huge thanks to Atria Books for the eARC via Netgalley! ﻿💌Okay, hear me out—this book was like getting hit with every rom-com trope in existence, and somehow, it WORKED. 😂Margot Bradley is a bestselling romance author who—plot twist—doesn't believe in HEAs. And when her secret Happily Never After document leaks, she gets canceled hard. Her solution? Run off to Alaska to write a murder mystery (because what could go wrong?). Enter Forrest Wakefield, a doctor-turned-reluctant-lodge-owner with a heart of gold and a serious case of grumpy-but-soft-for-her. 🥹Listen. This book is self-aware AF. It throws every classic romance trope at you—forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers, one tent, only one bed, stuck in the wilderness—and it knows exactly what it's doing. Margot even acknowledges how absurd it is, which made it so much fun. 😭💖 Things I Loved:✔ Alaska setting – the snowy vibes were immaculate. ❄️✔ Forrest – if book boyfriends were a competition, he’d at least place Top 5. A hot, broody doctor who quotes Taylor Swift at the gym? Please. 🫠✔ Margot's chaotic energy – girl was out here dodging moose and embarrassing herself at every turn, and I was living for it.✔ The romance!!! – The slow burn, the tension, the emotional depth—I was hooked.🤨 What Didn't Work as Much:✘ That ending felt RUSHED. I needed at least 20 more pages of Margot & Forrest being cute. 🫠✘ Margot’s conflict choices... questionable. Some moments made me wanna shake her like, girl, use your brain just once.But overall?? This was adorable. Fluffy, hilarious, and genuinely heartwarming. If you love rom-coms that embrace the chaos, this one’s for you. 😍Tropes you’ll eat up:❄️ Enemies-to-lovers❄️ Forced proximity❄️ Romance author x Doctor❄️ Grumpy & Grumpier❄️ A moose steals the showFinal verdict: This was unhinged in the best way and I loved it. 😂 Definitely picking up whatever Victoria Lavine writes next!"

 ""₊⊹⁀➴You think you’re unlovable, but I think I’ve never known how to love until knowing you.”

This book completely took me by surprise—in the best way. I went in expecting a typical enemies-to-lovers story, but what I got was so much deeper and more heartfelt.Emily, with all her quiet insecurities and fierce love for her sisters, felt incredibly real to me. And Jack? He’s the kind of male lead that ruins all others—protective, gentle, and so emotionally aware. Their connection wasn’t rushed; every moment they shared felt intentional and tender. I especially loved how the story explored self-worth and healing, without ever feeling heavy.Sarah’s writing is beautiful and emotionally layered. I found myself slowing down just to soak it all in. The banter was witty, the emotions were raw, and the pacing was nearly perfect—though I do wish their “enemies” phase had lasted a little longer. Still, the way their love unfolded was stunning.This wasn’t just a romance—it was a deeply human story about learning to believe you’re worthy of love. I’d recommend it in a heartbeat.°˖➴ ""Overall, if you’re in the mood for a book that’ll light up your face and make you giggle like a teenager crushing on their favorite fictional couple, this one is the perfect catch for you!""  💌-ˋˏ✄┈┈┈┈୨ৎ  pre-read:⤿ started - january 14, 2025got my hands on this beauty and im so freaking excited to read it with my beautiful girl tanu 💌","My fav in the series!!!!

my thoughts:

Rome, Kentucky is my home🤍
I fear my review and whatever I say is not going to make this book justice.😩Sarah has a way with her writing that it just amazing. She has this incredible ability to craft stories that effortlessly transport you to the heart of the setting, making every scene vivid and alive in your mind. Her words have a way of pulling you in, wrapping you up in the world she creates, and making you feel deeply connected to the characters and their journeys. I could never grow tired of reading her works; every page holds something new and enchanting, and she never ceases to amaze me. I hope she always has a pillow that's cool on both sides and an endless flow of inspiration to continue blessing us with her stories. She’s one of my favorite authors and I have been reading her work for 3 years and can actually see the improvement in her writing. This book was so much more than just a romance. It delves deep into personal growth, the journey of finding your own path, and the importance of learning to accept yourself, flaws and all. What stood out the most was how it emphasized that it’s okay to ask for help, that seeking support doesn’t make you weak but rather shows strength and courage. It beautifully explores the complexity of our personalities, the struggles we face in embracing who we are, and how leaning on others can be a vital part of that journey. The way it balanced the emotional depth of self-acceptance and vulnerability with the warmth of romance made it such a profoundly rewarding read. It’s the kind of book that not only tugs at your heart but also makes you reflect on your own life and growth.⋆˚⊹ “Maybe not everything will end in hurt. But we’ll never know if we don’t try.” ⋆˚⊹This was one of my most anticipated reads of 2025, and it still feels surreal that I’ve actually read it now 😭If you saw my updates, you probably already knew this was heading straight for a 5-star rating. Honestly, I didn’t think I could love any of her books as much as Practice Makes Perfect, and I had some serious doubts about Emily going in, especially since I wasn’t her biggest fan in the previous books. But wow, this completely blew me away and exceeded every single one of my expectations.Every page was packed with witty banter, raw emotional struggles, and so much love. It was the perfect balance of heartache and joy, the kind of book that makes you feel everything so deeply. At this point, Sarah could publish her grocery list, and I’d read it like it’s a masterpiece.I hate this book because it made me painfully aware that no one is ever going to love me like Jack loves Emily. I hate it because now all I want is to pack my bags, move to a small town, and live my dream romance but here I am, stuck in nyc. I hate it because it gave me all the feelings, and I’m still reeling from it.I can't stop thinking about it, and I need everyone to read it. If this book isn’t already on your TBR, you need to add it immediately. Seriously, do it. You can thank me later.🤭⋆˚⊹”I’ve always struggled with connection. So it was nice to get it in books if not anywhere else.”⋆˚⊹Now, this book can totally be read as a standalone but I’m going to be honest, half of my excitement was because of the scenes with the characters of the previous books, so I would suggest if you haven’t read the first 2 books please do before reading this one. I promise you it’s going to make the experience more enjoyable. 🌶️another thing is that Sarah is known for her closed door romance, she decided to leave the door a little open this time and imo it helped with the relationship but if you still want to read a closed door book then just need to skip the chapters 25 and 32.➳ 
characters:
ೃ࿐ Emily walker🫧⭑.ᐟ“I did that all on my own because I don’t like to get too close to people. I always have this feeling like something will go wrong if I do—so it’s been easier to keep to myself.”
 If you are the oldest daughter you’ll probably relate a lot to Emily, even though I’m the youngest in my family I still felt her struggles as my own because of the way they are portrayed. Being the oldest daughter is a often complex role, and for Emily, it’s no different. She has the weight of expectations settled on her shoulders. After her parents passed away her younger siblings looked up to her, a responsibility that came with a quiet, unspoken pressure to excel in everything she did, whether it was academics, behavior, or even managing her own emotions. As the eldest, Emily quickly became the symbol of responsibility in her family, someone everyone relied on without a second thought. But that reliance often felt isolating, as the expectations placed on her made it difficult to find room for her own needs and desires.She’s terrified of giving love a chance and opening her heart. Deep down, she feels like no one truly loves her hat people only tolerate her because of her personality. She is a control freak, scared of change and clinging to the familiar out of fear. My heart ached for her because it was so clear that she was trapped in her own darkness, carrying that weight all by herself. I just wanted to reach through the pages and give her the biggest hug🥺: ̗̀➛ 
“I don’t like change. And I’m terrified of relationships. But I find myself contemplating both of those things for him.”
: ̗̀➛ 
”I don’t know how to tell him that this pain is always hovering just below the surface these days. It’s not alcohol induced. It’s raw and it’s lurking and I’m not nearly as capable of handling my shit as I seem.”
ೃ࿐ Jack Bennett🫧⭑.ᐟ“I’ve kept myself hidden too much. It’s a harrowing feeling to look around and realize you don’t have a single friend to turn to in a hard time”
Jack Jack Jack, where do I even begin with him? He is perfect, I’m not joking, I need him right nowww. Let me paint you the picture, he’s brunette, WEARS GLASSES😚💓🤭😏😝😻, ride a motorcycle, has cute tattoos on his arm, always have a beaded necklace because his students gave it to him as a gift AND he is good with his words and actions.When I started the book I was like “there’s no way someone is going to top the love of my life Will Griffin” well…. Jack is running pretty close for the spot. He’s such a sweetheart. He cares so much for everyone around him.He had me down bad.He grew up with a narcissistic father, which left him with people-pleasing tendencies and he just want to charms and win over everyone. But what really stood out to me was how those challenges didn’t stop him from becoming a genuinely good person. Watching him navigate those traits, striving to grow beyond his upbringing, was both inspiring and moving. The fact that he was so determined to break the cycle and be nothing like his father speaks volumes about his strength of character and resilience. It’s a reminder that our past and our upbringing doesn’t have to define us, we can choose who we want to be.: ̗̀➛ 
“Because I may be a lot of things, but I never want to be the kind of person who can’t apologize when I’m in the wrong.

It was funny, but not in an immature or over-the-top way it felt natural, sharp, and full of personality. Even while they were bickering, the chemistry between them was undeniable, crackling on every page. They had me giggling like a fool at 4 a.m., and if I wasn’t crying over the emotional moments, I was laughing because of their dynamic.

It allowed us to see them as individuals, outside the constraints of their professional roles. Without the pressure of academia and the expectations that come with being colleagues, their true personalities had room to shine. It felt more intimate and authentic, like we were getting to know the real versions of them instead of the personas they wear at work. That setting made their connection feel so much more genuine and relatable.⋆˚⊹“I don’t think I’ve ever really felt loved until her”⋆˚⊹One way to explain their relationship would be this picture:Oh to be loved like Jack loves Emily🥹Guys, I seriously love them together. They’re such an incredible couple, so perfectly matched in every way. The fact that they’ve known each other for over a decade adds depth to their relationship. I loved their “nemesis” vibes, the playful tension, the snarky comments but underneath it all, there was always this undeniable attraction simmering between them, even if neither of them could fully understand or admit it at first. Watching that dynamic slowly unravel into something deeper was everything I could’ve hoped for. They just get each other in a way that feels so natural. my favorite thing about their relationship was how they understood and supported each other.🫶🏻⋆˚⊹“But with Jack, I’m starting to realize, everything just feels right.”⋆˚⊹✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* ✧･ﾟ: ➳

I’ve never cared about anyone like I care for you.”・❥・“Loving you is the easiest thing I’ve ever done.”・❥・“I don’t need anything from you other than for you to unlock the door for me so I can come lie with you when the darkness is too heavy to crawl out of. And if you need to fight, you can fight with me.”・❥・“People I love die. Or they hide things from me and leave. Or they simply outgrow me and move on. The one constant in my life has been me, at the end of the day, alone in my bedroom. And if I let myself love Jack fully with arms outstretched wide and he leaves me, it will break me.”・❥・“I want to hug each other when we’re sad and help each other find the bright side of things when all we can see is the dark.”・❥・“Tell me you’re okay. I need to hear you say it.”・❥・ Jack softly wraps his hands around my wrists, cradling them. “I’m listening, Emily. What do you need?”“I need you to fix it.” “Name it. I’ll do it for you.” He sounds like he means it.・❥・“It’s okay that time is moving and changing. Maybe it’s okay if I move and change too.”・❥・ He sees all the truth swimming in my veins. Regret. Pain. Loneliness. Helplessness. “Whatever it is, you’re going to be okay. I promise. I’ll make sure of it.”・❥・“It’s going to be okay. I’m always the one promising that sentiment. I happily take on the responsibility of everyone’s burdens because I only ever feel good when I’m being useful to someone. But hearing those words whispered softly to me . . . it’s heaven.”・❥・“It’s none of your business. My decisions are my own.” “Dammit, Emily, they don’t have to be, though! Just talk to me. Tell me exactly what hurts. Let me be here for you,” I say, my voice pleading now.

Tell Me Every Lie,"Ellen Hagan, David Flores",4.00,"It’s been ages since I’ve read a young adult contemporary romance this good. A romance with fairly low drama, with depths of character backstory, with a quick bu authentic connection between our love interest and a setting that is relaxing and enjoyable and believable. Honestly, in a time where I’m really struggling to connect with stories and characters, Tell Me Every Lie was exactly the book I needed and I thoroughly enjoyed it. John Paul. Recently graduated from high school. Mourning his father. And traveling to a fancy resort with his aunt, uncle and cousins, a place he knows he doesn’t belong. It’s meant to be when his family reconnect but who knows when his mother will come, if at all. So this summer, he’ll be JP rather than John Paul. Someone who is cool and calm rather than the guy who has to count his breaths to make it through the day.Mia. One last summer until she finally makes it out of Monument, follows her dreams of a future far away doing something she loves. One last summer of looking after entitled goats (sorry, guests) at Majestic Mountain House resort. But a dare from an idiot coworker makes her dreams that one step closer. Who cares if she has to get a goat to fall in love with her, she’s desperate enough to do anything. It all starts with a lie. Multiple lies. JP lies about his family, who he is, what he’s into. Mia lies about her family, her dreams for the future and why she’d even be interested in JP. But despite the lies, John Paul and Mia might actually find a truth they didn’t realise they needed.For a book all about lies and a dare, there is delightfully little drama. Sure there’s a bit of tension and your usual “I need to come clean and tell the truth” build up, but there is just something about JP and Mia’s connection. Add in a majestic backdrop, plenty of action, great side characters and some real depth to discussions around race, comics, substance abuse, and therapy, and you’ve got a fantastic book. I adored JP’s chapters. So lyrical and descriptive. Mia’s chapters fit her chapter, facing things head on, pragmatic. Yes, their romance takes place over just five days. Yes, they lie to each. And yet, and yet!! There is something so genuine and enjoyable about their connection. It doesn’t feel rushed, despite the timeline and it feels so authentic despite their lies to each other. I’m not a fan of the cover, got to be honest, but I did really enjoy this book. A great addition to the library’s romance collection and a book I’m more than happy to place in the school library.The publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes.

Rewind It Back,Liz Tomforde,4.59,"I refuse to believe that this series is over. Bc if I think a little too hard about it I will literally SOB myself into a mental breakdown.

Shield of Sparrows,Devney Perry,4.50,my favorite book of the year. maybe even my favorite romantasy EVER.thank you to Red Tower and Devney for a physical ARC.,"4.5🤩⭐️“Not all monsters are born from the gods, my queen. Some of us were made……..”✨❤️‍🔥I know I know… this might sound a little contradictory but hear me out: I’ve read this story a thousand times… and yet I absolutely LOVED this one!!Like—why does it feel like there’s a literal romantasy template floating around that authors pull from?🤨🤔🧐We’ve got:	•	Misunderstood outcast FMC 🔥	•	Thrown into an arranged marriage for political gain 💍	•	Off on some epic quest ✨	•	Gets captured by a brooding, morally gray man who ends up being her fated whatever 🖤	•	Makes besties with his crew = found family 🫂	•	Realizes she’s actually some ancient magical being who could destroy or save the world 🐉🔮	•	Then boom… HEA (after angst, betrayals, and maybe a dragon type thing) ✅🔥BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?I ate it UP like the loyal romantasy simp I am. And dare I say it?🤦🏾‍♀️✨💀❤️‍🔥😂This is one of my new fave romantasies. PERIOD.‼️Denver Perry (known for small town romances, btw) snapped with her romantasy debut. Red Tower Publishing & Entangled really know how to publish books that are so easy to devour. Like yes, it feels familiar — BUT IT SLAPS EVERY TIME. Thank you for the ARC!!🫂🤗Let’s get into it:	•	Enemies to lovers (painfully slow burn but WORTH IT — the angst!! the tension!!) ⚔️❤️‍🔥	•	Arranged marriage with a man who gives “touch her and die” energy 💅	•	Magic, myths, secrets, and messy prophecies 🕯️📖🗝️	•	World-building so lush I could literally see every location in my head like a full-on movie 🎬🏰🌌	•	Major twists that had me clutching my chest 😮‍💨	•	And that ending? RUDE. I am NOT okay 😩📉The vibes?? Gave me the same giddy thrill I felt after reading that one dragon book from Red Tower4️⃣🪽 (yeah… that one), but I’ll be honest… I liked this world more 🫣🫶I’m officially stanning this series and I will be impatiently waiting for the sequel while spiraling into a book hangover 👸👑☠️READ IT. Even if it’s got a familiar recipe, it still served a 5-star meal 🍽️📚💭“Did you ever stop to think that maybe the door to your cage has always been unlocked, Sparrow? And all you had to do was push it open?”🐦🚨just found out this got picked up to be a film!!! Hoping the adaption is able to accurately depict this wonderful book!!🚨","UPDATE I changed my mind upon reflection this bitch deserves a 5 star, ok?4.5 stars!! honestly a fkn GOOD romantasy debut by Ms. Devney Perry 💅🏼 the world building was incredibly well done and unlike anything I’ve read in this genre recently!!the plot twists and mystery elements that she is so skilled at weaving throughout her books really shone here and kept me flipping pages at an alarming rate - I was held hostage against my will simply needing to know what would happen next. ugh. the tension and slow burn almost genuinely killed me, I would lay my mf life down for both of these characters. the ending eviscerated me and maybe was some of the craziest shit I have ever read LOL. I need book 2 immediately, and naturally I will probably have to wait 7294 years for it. kill me I hate (love) arc reading!!!"
Funny Story,Emily Henry,4.21,"4.75!“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don't get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.Those are the moments that make a life.Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.The things that matter.The things I can't stop longing for.”
Now I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily's best work and after a rant with Roxy I understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry's works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing is engaging and has you fully immersed in the book you probably won't see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn't make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there' just something so beautiful about it.Okay so it's basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fiancées cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There's this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at: 
""Wait!' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. ""So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn't come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?''Im sorry,' I say again.'That fucking rules,' He says. 'How'd he take it?""
Daphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry's men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bug Roxy off so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was where He panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too late I won't elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)Their banter that I loved:
""True,' he says 'but I haven't had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed''Oh, they're all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV''Not us,' he says'No, we're adventurous' I say""_""I turn to look at him. 'Even when you try to be mean, you're nice,'His eyes seem to spark when he smiles. 'I'll try harder.""_""Do me a favor,' he says lightly, 'Unlock your door.''Why?''So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,' he says,'You would never,' I say'I would never' he admits.""_“Drink. Dance. Have fun.”“In a room with our exes,” I point out. “Who think we’re dating.”Miles’s smile hitches up. “See?” he says. “Doesn’t that sound fun?” 
I absolutely loved the friendship that Ashleigh and Daphne had because it was so down to earth and real and raw that I just fell in love with it and I think it was because Emily focused on Ashleighs character as well and gave her a story which made us understand where she was coming from and what was happening and how that eventually led them to be friends and I also loved how she supported Daphne's decisions but wont lie to her as well and would subtly try to make her understand things, she was certainly better than whatever the fuck Sadie was. Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.
""You're worth it, Daphne,"" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.'Miles?' I whisper. 'I do, I do what all those parts of you'His eyes open, molten, warm, 'Good,' He says. 'They want you too.'Then he kisses me.""
The romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn't like ' oh one look and im hard' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.Now,The things that could have been better; (spoilers)(credits;roxy)1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.3, Male povs because having Miles's POV would have been so interesting since would've gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.4, More drama by Miles's mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages more Now the scenes that I loved1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh5, Miles going to confront Daphne's dad6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.Overall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.

Special shoutout to Roxy for getting me to read all of Emily's books last year and hearing my rants about it. We need another EH buddy reading session.___EMILY HENRY I AM IN LIVE WITH YOU!! LETS GET MARRIED SO I CAN GET ALL THE STORIES YOU WRITE (RTC when I finish my rant with Roxy and gather my thoughts)___Its time 💫• Buddy reading with the one and only Roxy(Emily Henry so far all my anticipated reads have not met my expectations I'm begging you pls don't disappoint.)___Yes, Emily henry is a drug and i am an addict.I am not even joking when i say this but this is the only ting that i am looking forward to this year.Emily Henry writes the best books, her writing style alone is so beautiful and bewitching and the feeling of loosing yourself to it is so immense and amazing that i just cant wait to feel that again!!","2.5/5The review contains spoilers!What a forgettable, bland, boring and not Funny Story. This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I'm still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship — ""You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time — which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn't end up to be a fun read for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn't even close to the bond I had with January, who I'm starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quite okay"" about her if she hadn't moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn't that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn't so sure about it and who, speaking of which — let's get to him now. Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones's Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him

""Miles looks up at me. “They,” I say, “suck.” “She’s the love of my life,” he says. “The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.""

The love of your life? Hell no. I didn't like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn't happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne's answer was this

""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back? “Definitely not,” I say aloud.""

and Miles’s that

""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”

She cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don’t know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him. 

""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried. I still care about her.” 

She cheated on you and then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??

""I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.""

And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don't even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry's book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I'm in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily's book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card. ────────Me at my graduation: 😐Me at my wedding: 😐Me when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰","I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.This book isn't my favorite among Emily Henry's works. ""Happy Place"" holds that position, while ""People We Meet on Vacation"" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry’s books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I'm sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I’m one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)But let's be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He’s caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous – not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I'm usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!I have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I've never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.I won't give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fiancée’s new fiancée’s ex-boyfriend couldn’t be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That’s why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don’t whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other’s rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.The plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fiancée Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra’s dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter’s door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?Yes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children’s librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fiancée defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter’s wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.But what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?Well, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on!

Powerless,"Lauren  Roberts, Cristina Macía Orio (Translator)",4.17,"an editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩i am what some sexist pigs would call a basic b*tch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes - whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content. this book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was “if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic b*itch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that, then scroll away. do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite frankly hilarious stupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to delete after screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing. for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash. it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy. and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable prince krabs kai is, when i should just be able to infer from what the author implies. except the author didn't imply anything, for f*ck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes. if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes: knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid sh*t that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl - mhm wow what a great idea, it's totally not going to get your dumb ass killed. aaand now they’re playing thumb war. sorry are we sure this dude is the future enforcer?➳ “what i should have done was laugh in his face before making him go down the staircase first, but i’ve thrown caution to the wind and hastily replaced it with curiosity.”yeahhh great idea, go down a dark, damp, dank, dirty, dusty, secret stairway with a guy you're not even sure you should trust. greaaat idea!!➳ “it’s really quite simple,” calum says. “the majority of us will finally all gather together, and we’ll show the people of ilya who we are and what we have to say. show them that we are not a threat while also reminding them of who they have been killing for decades. the king is going to have to either admit his lies about the ordinaries or simply give us our freedom. and you are going to help us do it.”ahhh yess so simple - it totally won't lead to a bunch of deaths, lies, revelations, and another book.➳ “i can practically hear sadie blink behind me. she’s clearly stunned by his lack of concern, especially after seeing the two of us dancing together only minutes ago. i would be stunned myself if i wasn’t so used to seeing his masks—if i didn’t recognize the cold one he’s just slipped on.”every.romantasy.ever because GOD FORBID A MAN SHOW HIS FEELINGS➳ “yes, we are opponents. yes, i am the future enforcer. yes, I’m a killer that has no right to want to keep her. but there is something else, something that has her refusing to admit this confusing connection we share.”wannabe mafia lord who?➳ “something begins burning inside of me, but I ignore it, not bothering to acknowledge the jealousy painting me Ilya’s kingdom color.”i- ..no comment➳ oh, but little miss paedyn gray over here was no better. every part about her needed a special mention (or two). even her ass! “as soon as my ass got numb from sitting on that bloody stump, i stood and paced circles around our camp before splashing cold water from the creek on my face and body. then my ass got cold, and i moved next to the fire to lie down on the hard ground i’m so familiar with.”narcissism who?? this was my daily reminder as to why fictional ya books don’t include the part where they have to deal with bodily functions out in the wild. ➳ and in regards to the trials aspect, it had no real point. our only explanation was that the elites were being killed off in an arena to display their oh-so-original powers despite us constantly being that the elites' lives were more valuable. what the f*ck?? someone introduce this author to world-building immediately. it would have been much more understandable if it were all the ordinaries to battle to the death, (despite this already drawing a lot from the hunger games) and then you get your one oh-so-precious girl who goes through a makeover, has two guys lusting after her yada yada yada [insert all your favourite 2010 dystopian references here]. i honestly wouldn’t have even minded it, and i would have eaten it up immediately.➳ if anyone is interested in more of my points, i wrote a very long paragraph in message 192 on page 4 of the comments section below. it's also one of the many pages where you can find me breaking my promise to myself to not respond to idiots on the internetmoving on, let’s go back to paedyn seeing as my love for her runs so deep!she’s katniss’s not-like-other-girls cousin who decides to insult the f*ck out of you the minute you’re stood in a 2-mile radius to any guy. i wanted to claw her eyes out when she began with her “play the part sh*t” - which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree. ANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine! now for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the book by far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*he was as bland as unseasoned chicken. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!(i was going to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩after this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless. update: there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳ illéa ilya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else ➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

a two years later edit: hi! i am in fact the intended audience for this book. bye!","➸ 4 stars

”if i am to be her enemy, i want it to be because she loathes herself for wanting me.”

➷ powerless follows paedyn, a cunning and sassy street thief from the slums trying to make ends meet with her best friend. this is set in a world that went through a great plague — the majority of people who survived (the elites) were graciously gifted powers to them by the plague and those who didn’t (the ordinaries) were banished or killed. in pae’s kingdom, ordinaries are inferior to elites, and the king ordered for all ordinaries to be eliminated to preserve his elite society. paedyn is an ordinary who pretends to be an elite and poses as a psychic so that her true identity is not exposed. but when paedyn saves prince kai she finds herself thrown into the purging trials, a deadly competition held to showcase the elites’ powers — the one thing paedyn lacks.i know this book is heavily compared to Red Queen and The Hunger Games, but as i haven’t read neither of those books i can’t make any comments on that. — there is no better feeling than when a book is so good you simply can’t put it down and you end up staying up late reading it. this book had my attention gripped, especially the last 100 pages!! 1 more page turned into me finishing the whole book at 2am. i needed a fun, light, banter filled romantasy to help with my slump and this is exactly what this book delivered, both of the main characters had me in the biggest chokehold. yes this book was very tropey but it didn’t ruin my reading experience as the author cleverly wove in the tropes into this story without it feeling like she was shoving them down your throat. she did also mention that she wanted all of her favourite tropes incorporated into this book. 

“she’s so stunning, yet so stubbornly oblivious to how the sunset behind dulls in comparison to the vibrance that is her.”

➳ paedyn: right off the bat i absolutely loved pae, her sharp tongue and her even sharper mind - i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!! ➳ kai: the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!! — what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮‍💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!! 

”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”

— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect. this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!","4 stars 'Who did this to you' BOY 'why do you care' GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot! This story was quite interesting, and I can't compare it with Hunger Games because I haven't read that series, but it gave me Shatter Me vibes (as in powers and some scenes).• Kingdom of Ilya is divided into two types of groups, ELITES (with powers) and ORDINARIES (powerless). Elites were gifted with different powers because of a PLAGUE, and the ordinaries were banished from the Kingdom because they're rumored to lessen the powers of the elites!The plot was plotting and IT WAS SO GOOD 😌 though, this book had a lot of repetition (flirting and banter), and was def tropey, it is still SO CUTE! The ending was so angsty, and I DAMN WELL KNOW THAT THE NEXT BOOK IS GONNA BE FULL OF ANGST!😭
Kai Azer
 — PRINCE WHO KILLS PEOPLE WITH NO POWER, BUT IS OBSESSED WITH THE GIRL WHO'S POWERLESS!!!!! What else do you want??? He's so hot for fuck's sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES. 😮‍💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her. like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and...... HE WROTE ON HIS HAND ""she said I can touch her when I'm sober"" WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 😭🧎‍♀️His character was kinda giving Aaron Warner vibes because HE'S A FREAKING WIELDER (he can wield anyone's power if they are near) also MAJOR DADDY ISSUES 👺
Paedyn Gray
 — I'm sorry but EW NAME 💀 She was cool, the way her fighting is described is amazing, and it was easy to imagine! How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn't quite hit me much just like Kai's.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞ yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger. THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I'm so glad she wasn't horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn't happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely. I won't say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick me Hermione Granger vibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying 'Gonna stab you in the heart' was literally the 288262th time. She's Vicious little thing as he called her. (reminded me of Violet)❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞• Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn't sense any power from her. Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she's without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editor otherwise everything was fine. This series has a lot of potential! I can't wait for book 2 ughhhh 😭 I. WANT. THAT. BOOK. (because it's gonna get super angsty and Kai is out for blood).🩸🗡⤷

Fearless,Lauren  Roberts,4.19,"i am so fucking disappointed in Lauren Roberts. like genuinely, viscerally, soul-deep disappointed.i just finished the Powerless trilogy and the only logical conclusion i’ve come to is that Lauren Roberts is a thief. not metaphorically. not playfully. i mean a straight-up, copy-paste, no-shame thief. she hasn’t just borrowed tropes; she’s lifted entire plots, worldbuilding systems, character arcs, even dialogue—from not one, not two, not even three, but five wildly popular fantasy/dystopian series. and she’s parading them around like they’re original. like we haven’t read the very stories she’s plagiarized—just with different names.the books in question:The Hunger Games,Red Queen,The Selection,Dance of Thieves, and now, The Serpent and the Wings of Night.let’s break it down: 1. The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins)(which, by the way, is one of my favorite series of all time; so yes, i noticed every. single. rip-off.)(1) The Hunger Games” vs. “The Purging Trials” – let’s talk about “The Purging Trials”—a blatant, shameless knock-off of the Hunger Games arena. teens battling to the death for survival while being broadcasted live for public entertainment? sound familiar?(2) in Powerless, the trials are broadcasted, and participants can win favor from the audience for rewards. literally sponsorships. she didn’t even try to hide it.(3) the societal divide: Elites vs. Ordinaries? ok, hi again Capitol vs. Districts.(4) Paedyn being good at archery because her dad taught her? a direct Katniss knockoff. (5) and oh, the favorite color scene. she deadass copied one of the most tender moments between Peeta and Katniss and slapped it in like no one would notice.it was soul-crushing when suzanne did it with green and orange but lauren just made a cheap copy. 2. The Selection (Kiera Cass)(1) the name of the kingdom in The Selection is “Illeá.” In Powerless? “Illya.” i can’t even make this up. cuz apparently, even changing a single letter is enough to pass it off as different.(2) the whole love triangle setup. been there, read that (wasn’t great the first time, was terrible the second)(3) the rebellious father backstory—just like America’s dad in The Selection.(4) and ofc, the classic “i’m not like other girls” moment where she wears a different colored dress at the royal ball so she stands out. r we serious?3. Red Queen (Victoria Aveyard) (1) the entire foundation of the world in Powerless is a carbon copy of Red Queen. society divided by those with powers (Elites/Silvers) vs. those without (Ordinaries/Reds). powers = privilege. lack thereof = oppression. copy. paste.(2) Paedyn pretending to have powers so she can survive in elite society? that is Mare Barrow’s whole plotline.(3) resistance movement? underground rebellion? also stolen.(4) she even gave pae silver hair. come on.(5) and the sweet, nurturing best friend/sister who sews clothes? (adena) v have alr seen this exact character already. MULTIPLE times.IN RECKLESS:4. Dance of Thieves (Mary E. Pearson) (1) Captor vs Captive Turned Lovers Trope: in Dance of Thieves, Kazi (the FMC) and Jase (the MMC) are enemies who end up chained together, forced to survive side by side—and obviously catch feelings in the process. in Reckless, Paedyn and Kai are… wait for it… forced together, on the run, enemies-to-lovers, while constantly questioning each other’s motives. the same dynamic. the same slow-burn trust. the same suspicious angst. even the same “let’s sleep back-to-back in the wilderness” kind of vibes.(2) Kazi hides who she really is and what she’s doing. so does Paedyn.Jase hides his plans. so does Kai.everyone’s playing some undercover game while flirting and making vague threats. the “we’re both lying to each other but somehow falling in love” thing? yea, Roberts just copied it.(3) MMC similarities: Jase is the leader of a powerful outlaw family ruling a feared territory. in Reckless, Kai is the Enforcer—basically royalty in the most brutal, fearsome way. both are boys with titles, knives, and emotional walls. both are feared. both are wanted. both are soft only for the main girl.(4)The Desert Survival Vibe: a lot of Dance of Thieves takes place in rugged, dangerous territory. guess what we get in Reckless? the exact same unforgiving journey through wastelands, hostile environments, and constant physical challenges that magically draw the couple closer. HOWWWWWW original.AND NOW FINALLY, IN FEARLESS: 5. The Serpent and the Wings of Night (Carissa Broadbent)(1) Paedyn finds out she’s secretly royalty? just like Oraya. (2) and the final trial ends up with Paedyn and Kai fighting each other—just like Oraya and Raihn being forced to go head-to-head.(3) the vibes? the dynamic? the whole “forced to fight the one you love in a death trial”? yep. stolen yet again.it is not even subtle. it’s not like “inspired by” or “a nod to.” it’s blatant. it’s lazy. it’s disrespectful to the authors who actually built these worlds from scratch.what annoys me more is that powerless is being hyped up as this “original, groundbreaking” series by people who either haven’t read the other books or just don’t care that it’s a collage of plagiarism.Lauren, if you’re gonna steal, the least you could do is not get caught. but you did.and we noticed.","I have been thinking on how to review this book. On one hand, it wasn't as good as some of the people said it was, but honestly, it wasn't a bad book by any means. Yes, some things were handled very poorly, but others were done very well. Powerless was an enjoyable experience for me, but I wanted more from it, Powerful was simply heartbreaking and amazing, Reckless was a heavy victim of the second book syndrome, and Fearless was an enjoyable experience tainted by poor execution. Lauren has the potential to write really good books, there are some scenes in the book which are so beautifully written and the novella 'Powerful' showed a lot of what she can do with a good story. After 'Reckless' my expectations for this book were low, but tbh I was enjoying the first half so much—like honestly, I did not have any problems because I was vibing with the book. Me and Rowan both were having fun at the start, and honestly, the romance in this one was going really well too. There were occasional bomb drops of the word 'Pretend' that made my eye twitch, but they were not enough to make me hate it. It was looking out to be 4 stars, but the second half changed so much for me.The pacing, for one, bothered me a lot. At times I would be so invested, but then there would be moments where I wanted it to move along and wrap it up because I felt like it was dragging. She paced this so viciously because those dragged moments would actually make me want to stop, but then a scene would drop that would have me so invested that it just bothered me. The repetitive nature in this part increased, and the 'Pretend' in this part made me wanna dnf this book!!! Like synonyms exist!!! One Google search!!! The plot twists for the sake of shocking us and them serving no purpose were there—one of them made me gag and I hated it. It really flipped the story and made me disgusted. But honestly, there was just so much going (not in a good way), and it felt like Lauren was having trouble grasping it. But besides that, the ending was satisfying and the epilogue was very sweet, even the one at the very end.The romance, I must say, Kai in the first two books wasn't my favorite, but he was so good in this. He played the desperate-for-her part so well, and the chemistry between these two was so on point. Every interaction that they shared enhanced the book. Their thoughts about each other were raw and intense that it actually made me fall in love just by reading them. From a romantic perspective, this book really delivered because the forbidden nature of this book provided us with so much angst and longing that we deserved, and it just hit in all the right spots. There wasn't miscommunication, there wasn't any denial—it was all there, and it felt so natural between them. Honestly, the romance for me made the book worth reading because it was building up to what it executed, and I can't praise it enough for that. Like, the scenes that me and Rowan talked about were sooo good, like the good things about this book that we talked about was the romance... the other was just venting out our frustration.SPOILERS!!SPOILERS!!SPOILERS!!The characters, Kitt was very frustrating to deal with because my emotions were changing about him at such a rapid pace, but I never fully settled on anything other than frustration and annoyance. Every scene of his was so eye-roll worthy, and the plot twist she pulled with him actually being bad through made me more mad. And the thing that was my last straw would be how he threw such a big tantrum—like A BIG ASS TANTRUM—only for him to say 'I hope you both love each other' at the end as he died. LIKE BITCH WHY WERE YOU WHINING THEN. Paedyn was really good in this one. I had very minimal problems with her, and her character development could be seen. And Kai was the star of this book—he made scenes with Kitt bearable, and honestly, he and Paedyn really aced this book, made it out to be a more enjoyable experience than it could've been.The plot, honestly, I really liked how the first and second trial went by. It made it feel more enjoyable and reduced the repetitive nature of the book, but the third one dragged. The whole incest thing put me off so bad because it was just so disgusting. There were intimate thoughts and scenes, so it was just very off-putting for me. The writing was inconsistent at times. Again, the plot twists were poorly executed. Some things were done very well, but they didn't outweigh the things that didn't. And honestly, the inconsistent pacing + the repeating nature of Kai's nicknames for Paedyn also annoyed me. If you can overlook these things, I do believe it could be a really good experience, but for me it was tainted because these hindered my experience a lot and I could not enjoy it fully which is sad because this book had immense potential.This honestly is her best work after Powerful lol.__You better ace this miss Roberts__The end unfortunately did not (w)reck me because I was expecting that to happen but I cant wait to see what happens next!__Haven't even finished Reckless but I know the end will (w)reck me 🤭","4.5⭐️ I genuinely don’t know if I can properly put into words what this book did to me. I’m feeling all the emotions. My eyes hurt. I’ve been staring at my wall for like 20 minutes just contemplating life.Listen after hating Reckless I wasn’t even sure that I was going to read this and oh my god am I so happy I did!!! THIS WAS EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND MORE!!! Is this series going to be for everyone? No absolutely not, I feel like you’re either gonna love or hate it, and I was scared I was gonna turn into a certified hater after reckless but NOPEEEEEEEEEE, I feel like Lauren Robert’s took all my issue I had with reckless and wrote fearless and said BET…. Let me prove you wrong.This isn’t a heavy fantasy read, the romance is the absolutely the main focus so also know that going in… but Kai and Pae actually own my soul at this point so like….. actually they own pieces of my jagged heart because WHAT THE FUCK I HAVE WHIPLASH!!!! I’m actually in severe emotional turmoil. THE ANGST. The longing. The tension. THE YEARNING?!!!!!!! Kai Azer. KAI AZER. No. Stop. This man had me in absolute SHAMBLES!!! Idk how but Lauren Robert’s somehow made him even better in this book. I’m sick. His complete and utter devotion to Pae had me on my knees. Pae and Kai’s romance in this was everything I was hoping for! The forbidden aspect, the push and pull, them giving in to their love for one another!! I felt like this was the most their chemistry shined and it was so palpable! I felt like in reckless their love wasn’t believable, that was so not the case here! My heart broke right along with theirs. I love how both of them was sacrifice everything for the other.Pae isn’t my favorite FMC, but I grew to love her in this book despite her royally pissing me off at points. I felt like she went through some much needed growth and her confidence in herself made me feel like a proud mom. But again… she did still piss me off, WHY DIDNT YOU JUST RUN AWAY WITH KAI?!!! Why did you go through with marrying kitt?!!!!!! Pissed me off so bad. Now listen, was the plot revolutionary? No, but like for me personally…. I GOBBLED IT UP! I loved that she had to go through trials again, I felt like it was super fast paced and easy to get lost in! Also the amount of plot twists that I never saw coming that had my jaw on the floor….. I’m still speechless. Kit and Pae being half siblings was not on my Fearless bingo card and it’s actually hilarious to me. Haters are gonna reach and say there was incest in here… BFFR. Idk maybe I just read too much dark romance but I loved how blindsided I was by this and how shocked it had me, I also just thought it was so funny. Also the fact that they all just acknowledged it literally one time and moved on…. DEAD. Small issues I had that made me incapable of giving this 5 stars:- Lauren did Mak so dirty, I’m so bitter that did not need to happen, I understand he’s at peace now with Adena but like IM NOT!!! I’m suffering.- It was pretty clear that Kit was sick and most likely dying early on…. But I hated how Kai was the one to ultimately take his life. Like why did you do that to my sweet baby angel Kai?! Hasn’t he suffered enough?! - Ending was just a little rushed.All in all I absolutely loved this. I highlighted almost every word that came out of Kai’s mouth. These quotes made me pass away.“She is the single most destructive thing I have ever desired, and yet, it is the diamond on her finger that will destroy me.”“Paedyn is not a right or a wrong, not something as simple as a yes or a no. She is confusion itself, a feeling unplaced, a color between black and white.”“I could fall to my knees, beg to be the only one worthy of witnessing her.”“I’m breathless at the sight of her, doomed by the hope of having her. It’s a beautiful ruin, a devastating devotion. This girl holds my heart in her hands, could crush it between her fingers and still have me thanking her for the touch.”“My name means nothing to me until she speaks it. Nothing until she claims it as her own.”“My favorite color is a shade of her, a sliver of the vibrance she exudes. And I will gladly drown, gladly burn, gladly fall into those blue eyes until the day she looks at me for the last time.”“So if you leave, I will follow. If you stay, I will bow. Because there has never been a moment when you did not own the only piece of me that mattered—loving you made me matter. And I ache to be full again.”“You don’t need a blade. I would bleed if only you asked.” “She is a vision, something so ethereal in this moment that I may just believe there is a God. She is the closest thing to a deity.”"

The prose - BEAUTIFUL and EXQUISITE. The story is so atmospheric and really just whisks you away to this small country town.I think the author did an incredible job at concealing many things from us. For a good while I wasn't sure who I liked and who I didn't. They're authentic and real. So well rounded and relatable.I sobbed so many times reading this - this book wrung me out emotionally. I was so invested with every single one of the characters over here biting my nails (which I don't do) just dying to find out what happened.From cover to cover this was an amazing story. Short chapters, beautiful writing, an engaging and consuming story that will have you flipping the pages into the wee hours in the morning to find out what exactly happened on this farm... you will want to untangle the entire thing and when you do - you will be shocked.Packed with twists and unbelievable revelations.

""she's a phantom in human form. like trying to catch the wind in your fist, unable to see it even while feeling it slip between your fingers.""

long story short: this book is about pae and kai walking in the desert the entire book. kai, what was it like carrying the whole book on your BACK!!— as someone who thoroughly enjoyed powerless, this book was a major letdown. with how powerless ended, this book was set up perfectly for an amazing enemies to lovers story, BUT WE DIDNT GET THAT. thank god this book was fast paced and that i buddy read this, bc i probably would’ve dnfd this one if it wasn’t for those factors. me rating this 1.5 is me being generous tbh. nothing in this book was memorable, the poppy scene was really cute but that was it 😭 i hyped this book up so much in my head only for it to leave me so utterly disappointed!! i overlooked the overused words/phrases in the previous book but i couldn’t in this story bc it was driving me fkn insane!! i’m surprised i didnt get whiplash from the amount of times everything was repeated. they were having the same convos, the tropes were all the same and going through the same scenarios the WHOLE book. pretend was used a total of 61 TIMES.. i literally wanted to jump into my book and slap them both. we all know no one is pretending here STFUUU. the “i hate you but i want you so let’s pretend” bullshit got so tiresome.kai: i can pretend she is nothing to me kai not even 2 secs later: i can no longer pretend 🤪🤪also, calling each other “enemies” was the biggest reach ever since they were kissing, flirting, dancing and bantering every chance they got. the back and forth was also so draining. i wouldn’t of mind if it was only for a small portion but they literally do this the entire book. it would go from “i could kill him/her” to them making out then back to “i could kill him/her” 

“do i haunt your dreams, plague your thoughts, like you do mine?”

the writing:the random long descriptive sentences were so weird. some sentences were formatted and constantly repeated but in a different way. you know when you are trying to reach your word count in an essay so you start writing random sentences that makes absolutely no sense just so you can achieve it, this is how this book is written lmao.skin is splattered with slices, covered in cuts […] skim fingers over the jagged skin.my brain reading that: “what would you do if when you okay so he said yes would go” (PLEASE TELL ME YOU ALL KNOW THIS)plot:error 505: no plot was found. i wasn’t kidding when i said that they walk the desert majority of the book lmaoo. they literally just yap and walk as they try to find their way back to ilya. it was so clear that powerless wasn’t supposed to be turned into a trilogy. this story was a whole lot of ✨NOTHING✨ there was literally no direction in this book, it’s so obvious that this book was just a filler. i felt like i was constantly reading the same thing over and over and over again. they just fight, she tries to escape, constantly pretend they hate each other and then make out. the repetitiveness was giving me a major headache. for a 400 page book there was no substance. 

“and then she smiles, bright and big like the night sky hanging above us. i fear she could rival the stars.”

some notes i had while reading:1. how do these characters survive when they only eat sticky buns 😭 2. what is the point of kitt’s depressing pov in this book. it was pointless and added nothing to the story. pls just get his crybaby ass out of my book, we don’t care about his severe daddy issues. 3. how is this book fantasy?? since there are no trials (so no powers) there is no fantasy element to be found in this story, it just reads like every romance book EVER. this whole book was just to build up pae and kai’s romantic development.4. why is this book lowkey a rip off of dance of thieves 5. pae willingly following kai back to ilya without a fight is so unserious. this girl was fighting kai every chance she got in powerless but now she’s just letting kai take her back to kitt?? i know they were chained together for some time but pae is a smart girl, she would’ve found a way to escape the restraints 6. why is calum out of all people advising kitt??7. THEIR FIRST KISS WAS THE LEAST ROMANTIC KISS EVER!! you are telling me i waited a whole book for THAT. it felt like the author just wanted to get it over and done with. cut the cameras and do it over again and make it more passionate. — nothing “major” happens until the last couple of chapters. but it was all still anticlimactic to me bc i saw it from a mile away with how it was teased. i’m sorry but with how some people were going on about how the ending was purely shocking, i literally thought someone died only to get to this basic cliffhanger 😭 there were no heart racing moments, no excitement or anticipation, nada. also wtf was that plot twist towards the end?? was that added for shock value too??— will i be reading the next book? of course, i feel like the next book should have an actual plot unlike this book and everything is set up well for fearless. and imagine all the angsttt. i’m really hoping lauren goes in the right direction with that book!! 🤞 even though this book was a mess it was still a quick read.「 the powerless trilogy 」#1 Powerless — 4 stars #1.5 Powerful — TBR#2 Reckless — 1.5 stars","2.00!“Hate me enough to make me want you.” I cup her jaw, feeling her eyes burning into mine. “Ruin me""
What a waste of potential tbh. I would say that despite enjoying the first book I had minimal expectations so I cant really blame this book being bad on my expectations because they were not high at all lol. The writing in this book was so mid like 😭 the author just went on writing the same thing over and over again until we reached the last bits which was supposed to be mind blowing but came off as too predictable. I did enjoy the first 80 to 100 pages to be honest but then the constant push and pull and the way the author filled this book with too many quotes that they didn't even hit like they should and 😭😭 I cant even start at how tropey it was like surely you cannot write all the tropes in this book and expect all of them to hit the readers the same way. It just got so claustrophobic in there that I wanted to finish it. Paedyn our FMC 😮‍💨 I really liked her in the first book but I was so frustrated when it came to her character in this one, dont get me wrong I still enjoyed reading her point of view but I feared that my eyes would be stuck at the back of my head if I read Paedyn saying 
""I would not hesitate to kill him next time""
 and not doing that the next time one more time😭 because saying it once or twice makes sense but more than that and you look like a fool which unfortunately Paedyn did look like for majority of the book. It's that I thought with how things ended in book 1 Paedyn would put up a little bit of fight and she did for like 80 pages but then it vanished?? and I hated that so much.Kai, I enjoyed his point of view as well and I did have fun reading about him and I liked that we got an insight of his past, I also liked his flirty nature and the way he would speak of her and his dialogues in general but when you're sent out to kill her and you're trying to be string enough to do that YOU DONT START FLIRTING WITH THEM but I had almost very little complaints with Kai because even poor writing can't do Kai wrong. As for Kitt, I found his pov similar to how I felt Apollo's pov was in ACFTL.....boring and unnecessary.The plot was where?? for a romantasy there was barely any fantasy in it. Dont get me wrong, if it was a full romance book it would've been an easy 3.5-4 stars but as a romantasy it failed to deliver on anything but the romance and even a part of that was annoying. The author said that this book was a build up to the third book but there was honestly nothing building up until like the last 30-50 pages and I am not even lying when I say this this could have been a 100-150 paged novella if we keep in mind the important things that happen and if you want to add more romance to that but dont want to overfill it 200 pages at best and it would have been perfect, would have had us at the edge of our seats and would have given us some actual content in one go rather than it being dispersed among filler scenes and it would've been more easy to write and would have given Lauren more time to focus on book 3 so she could have delivered a massive finale. A little bit of this book was about Kai going after Paedyn (100 pages at best) and then it was them trying to go back to Ilya. The ending I saw coming because I honestly saw no other suitable way to end this book and basing it off peoples reactions my suspicions were confirmed so even for what most peopled saved this book, failed for me.The romance, I did enjoy the dialogues exchanged, the tensions and angst at times (until it got too much) and some of the cute moments that they shared but one thing that this book lacked was slow burn because everything happened so fast and wasnt this supposed to be enemies to lovers?? what I read was definitely not enemies to love it was two people being in denial like the constant push and pull was fun at the beginning but it got so tedious because it was the same thing repeated until the end and I wanted scream at them. I wanted more slow burn like yes the first book was slow burn enough but when you end powerless saying that Kai would be going out to kill Pae you would expect more fresher slow burn and thats why I did not really love the first kiss, it was written well but I just didnt like how fast it happened. It could have happened later on as well. I do admit that there was angst and tension but it didn't hit me. I liked the development the character got through romance but theres this thing called balancing a book and there was no balance here and tbh if I wanted that I would have just picked up a romance novel instead of this.I did enjoy some parts of it and I liked Kai + the fast paced nature of this book and I can see people who only want KaiPae romantic moments would really enjoy this book but honestly I wanted that but only to an extent with balance, political intrigue and a plot because otherwise I would've just read When Gracie Met the Grump which is sitting right beside me. Overall, A disappointing experience and im hoping that the conclusion redeems itself with more Mak scenes.~~~Look what just came in the mail 🙈•Buddy reading with the one and only Roxy"
Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,4.27,"I’m just slapping my head so hard! Why did I wait so long to jump into this MARVELOUS JOURNEY? I’m telling you, my friends: this is the BEST ABBY JIMENEZ BOOK! Absolutely her best work!I cried and laughed so much, and sometimes I did both at the same time! The book brings out so many different emotions you’ve buried inside and helps you set them free!A workaholic, responsible ER doctor’s path accidentally crosses with a small-town mayor when her car gets stuck in a ditch. Blame it on a mischievous raccoon!Alexis comes from an ultra-wealthy family of world-renowned surgeons but differentiates herself by becoming an ER doctor. At age 37, she has suffered enough from the emotional, verbal, and physical abuse of her ex and her own family.After a car accident, she finds herself in a small town called Wakan. (Wakanda forever! Okay, I wrote that to see if you’re still reading!) Daniel, who saves Alexis from the ditch, is a caring sweetheart and definitely a dreamy book boyfriend! Yes, he’s younger than her, the mayor of the town, an efficient carpenter, and runs his grandparents’ B&B. The guy checks all the boxes! I don’t know how Abby Jimenez creates the best hero characters in her books. Each one of them is exceptional. And luckily, this time Alexis is also easy to root for with her resilience, honesty, and genuineness.As Alexis spends time in that small town, taking a break from her responsibilities, extra busy schedule, and burdens from the past, she realizes she can find happiness in a place and with a man she never imagined before.I have to admit, some parts of the book truly hurt me. Reading about the traumatic experiences Alexis has been through was really painful. I felt so sad, angry, and heartbroken. The angsty parts were truly realistic and hard to digest!But like the sun coming out of the clouds, the sweet and promising love story in the book warmed my heart!I love this book so much! I am absolutely giving it five small-town, amazingly adorable hero, second-chance, emotional stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","dnf @ 59% i really tried to finish this book, like it had so much potential to be good bc the ratings are so high but i felt it was about to put me back into a slump bc of how boring it was and the fmc was unbearable!! she treats daniel like a child bc he is 28?? um, he literally knows more than you do so pipe down, he’s not that young. and also, how does she have a medical degree but is so helpless with life - she didn’t even know what a fkn broom was!! the mmc literally had to show her how to clean and cook like BFFR RN- she didn’t know what a breaker was, couldn’t make her own coffee and doesn’t know how to peel potatoes.. but calls her friends privileged?? YOU GREW UP WEALTHY LITERALLY STFU!! LIKE GIRLLL YOURE ALMOST 38 AND CANT DO DAY TO DAY NECESSITIES AND CANT EVEN STAND UP FOR YOURSELF TO YOUR SHITTY TOXIC PARENTS AND EX BF - alexis, i hope you go broke and i’m stealing daniel from you bc you don’t deserve him you ungrateful witch 😭 but honestly, i feel like i read a completely different book to everyone else lmaoo. — ok but mostly, i hated how they got together so early on in the book, like they have sex in chapter 4.. they’ve probably known each other for like an hour at this point and she was going on how she won’t sleep w him bc she doesn’t do ONS but then BOOM, she has sex w him like girl bffr pls you’re draining me 😐 the insta-lust/love threw me off, it leaves no room for the characters to grow and it just leaves the story to DRAG ON AND ON!! ppl say there was a lot of tension and chemistry between them, WHERE??? i felt nothing, it was so forced!! there’s no pining, longing or realisation that they’re falling for each other. this is why i stick with slow burns!!and don’t get me started about the ring light and the dick pic chapter situation.. like who gives a fuck about the angles and lighting ITS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT ANY BETTER!! AND WHY WAS HIS GIRL COUSIN GIVING HIM ADVICE ON HOW TO TAKE A FKN DICK PIC 🫥 also, i predicted the ending from the start and i had to check; shocker, i was right.","I loveddd this book!!! My first ever Abby Jiminez book and I'm excited I now have a new author to read! I loved that the conflict in this book is so realistic. I had no idea how they were going to resolve it which had me on the edge of my seat and made it that much more heartbreaking. I also loved all of the small-town characters. One of my favorite things about small-town romances is the found family feel which this book has. Also, how could you not falling love with a man who has a pajama-wearing baby goat🥹"
People We Meet on Vacation,Emily Henry,3.85,"i believe in the concept of soulmates.this may seem at odds with my overall extremely cool, edgy reputation, but let me explain. sure, your soulmate might be Some Guy, but equally it might be the feeling of flipping your pillow over to the cool side, or when the airplane seems to be fully booked but slowly the trickle of people doing that awkward slow-walk to stow their luggage comes to a stop and there's no one sitting in your row, or those authentic actual cream puffs where the puff part is pretty dry and disappointing but the cream is like ice cream if ice cream was actually good. (i do not like ice cream. this is just one more point in favor of my potentially being an alien.)you may believe that i have opened this review of a romance novel with a discussion of soulmates in a way to tie in the content of the book, and in a way, you would be right. but not really.sure, yeah, the alex and poppy contained within these pages are probably soulmates, as is the case with, you know, the genre as a whole.but I'm here to talk about MY soulmate. and with every passing day I become more convinced that surely, certainly, without a doubt, that that role in my life is filled by emily henry.okay, no. that's a bridge too far in creepiness levels even for me in my love for her, a love which I have declared in multiple reviews here, on my blog, in my bookstagram in a series of tangential-to-stalking posts, in one of those letter boards i used to have when they were trendy, in her DMs, in her comments, and so on.but i should clarify that it's her WRITING that is my soulmate.my favorite super-specific subgenre of all time is magical realism where I can really believe that the magic might just exist in our dumb old boring world, and she is the master of that. plus she includes lovely romances and incredible banter and the best ever friendships and a million other good and perfect things.i cried on a Greyhound bus rereading a million junes. i, a person who does not cry even in the privacy of my own oblivion AND a person who does everything but cease to exist when on a cross-country bus trip, cried! while REREADING!i loved when the sky fell on splendor so much that i...also made my review a love letter to its author!i so adored the love that split the world that i basically almost looked past the insta-love, something that has previously forever been impossible for me to do!and when i heard about beach read, an adult rom-com interrupting an all-star lineup of YA magical realism, i wrote the email equivalent of getting on my knees and begging to the publisher right away.and that's not where everything came to a screeching halt.that, like everything else emily henry writes, or i guess wrote to that point, was a mix of fairytale-like dreaminess and real-world Harsh Reality. ot had the real characters and the engrossing writer and the dialogue of a champion like everything else.and this...well, on the first read, i thought this did too. this felt a lot more rushed than some of emily henry's other books. the writing was fun and fresh and flirty when you sped through it, but if you slow down and try to relish it, it fights you on it. sentences get clunky and overloaded.this book is in many ways my kryptonite (positive): written by emily henry, bantery, angsty. the big three of romances.and in many ways it's my kryptonite (negative): it's big-man-tiny-woman. it has a happily ever after that is more like U(nhappily)EA or O(verly compromised)EA. alex is fairly boring and poppy is not a girls' girl.on first read, all emily henry romances were simply an emily henry prescription for me, and i used them up immediately and delightedly to feed my addiction. (sorry, that metaphor turned unexpectedly dark.) but upon reread, it became clear that emily henry's characters are so full and have their own lives to such an extent that they sometimes seem like...they should not be together?a big part of me hopes that someday, emily henry will get back to the young adult magical realism that has made it to my top five favorite books and my top favorites of the year and the hard to reach upper echelons of my grueling rating system several times over.but if she doesn't, that's okay too. i'd read math textbooks if she wrote them. (but only then and not a moment before!) i just hope that she can figure out how to keep her romances as magical and well-constructed and unique as the first books. but either way she's got that instant #1 new york times bestseller status, and that, i am willing to admit, is ever so slightly more prestigious (not to mention financially rewarding) than my enduring love and affection.and she has that anyway.bottom line: i'm a grump. but it's emily henry forever.-----------------reread updatebinge reading emily henry books just to feel something(updated review to come)-------------pre-reviewand the emily henry withdrawal starts...now.(it actually started last night, when i finished this book, but it hit too hard for me to even mark it as read.)review to come / 4 stars!-------------currently-reading updatesi would die for emily henry, but that wouldn't help me get my hands on this book as soon as possible.so i subscribed to book of the month instead.-------------tbr reviewsome people write enemies to lovers romance. some people write friends to lovers romance.emily henry said why not BOTH...nobody is doing it like her!!!-------------announcement reviewwho do i have to bribe to get my hands on this book?i am willing to offer anything. (and by anything i mean A Large Amount of Cookies and/or My Undying Love and Devotion.)","A light-heartened and quick read that is totally predictable, entirely forgettable, and unoriginal.Poppy and Alex go on a vacation together every year. But will Poppy and Alex ever get together?This was just like The Bachelor, You've Got Mail, and a touch of The Notebook. Usually, I don't read romance but this one had some high reviews on GoodReads, and I wasn't so sure on the thriller I had selected. This book had a very light hearted feel which was nice after the last book that I read that literally was so dark that I was having nightmares. However, it was entirely predictable. After about halfway through, I was wondering OK can we just get there already? These romance type books really bother me because they are so unrealistic. Poppy lives in New York and has a jet-set lifestyle while Alex still lives in their small Mid-West town in Ohio, working as a teacher at the public high school. The characters are so quick to give up everything in their lives. In the real world, some things can't be changed so easily. Some people are not compatible no matter how much they love each other. It is a big deal for one person to want to get married, have children, own their own house, and the other person never wants to get married, never wants to have children, and wants to live with a bunch of people in a commune. Some people need a quiet calm place to feel safe. They need to have a job so that they feel financially safe especially when the other party doesn't want to get married. Just agreeing to ""everything"" will not work out long term. This book could have been so much better. In fact, it could have shown that there are some people who are wonderful to be around and go on vacation with, but they are not good at sharing your life with. For example, you might be madly in love with someone with a gambling/drug addiction. That person might make you feel like you are the most important person in the world, make you laugh and smile, and your eyes alight every time you think of that person. But you can't live with that person. You can't depend on that person to make sure that the rent will be paid or that they can show up to take you to your doctor's appointment. This book totally glossed over the fact that you can have deep, intense, magnetic, earth-shattering feelings for someone, but the relationship will not work out. It would have been so much better if Sara actually said, ""I know he loves you Poppy, but he gets you one week out of the year and he's mine the other 51. I want him to travel the world, and that's love, not standing in his way."" That my friends is the difference between memorable and forgettable. That's why we remember Casablanca, because the ending isn't predictable, and Rick was honest, realistic. The author also could have done a better job with the romance. Poppy and Alex have been doing this tango for 12 years. Yet we are supposed to believe that they just spontaneously happened to have these encounters? It rained so they decided to take their friendship to the next level? That is so lame. Alex couldn't think of anything more thoughtful (even though he is supposed to be this incredibly thoughtful guy)? He didn't buy all of the flowers in the flower shop? He didn't tell Poppy that she looked beautiful in the light? He didn't save up all of his credit card points to try to take her to a nice vacation, something that would really ""speak to her"" as a traveling guru? He didn't try to show off his muscles to try to catch her eye? I mean I have been out of the dating game for awhile, but I remember it being more exciting than this book......Emily Henry has a new book coming out April 25, 2023, Happy Place.2025 Reading ScheduleJan	A Town Like AliceFeb	BirdsongMar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr	War and PeaceMay	The Woman in WhiteJun	AtonementJul	The Shadow of the WindAug	Jude the ObscureSep	UlyssesOct	Vanity FairNov	A Fine BalanceDec	GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta My Bookstore at Pango","I think I want to give a million hugs to the author right now! I fell so hard for her latest book Beach Read, which is still my favorite romance book of last year!I thought nothing she could write would be better than this lyrical, dreamy, feel-good tearjerker love story. But after reading this heartbreakingly amazing book, I’m taking it all back: this book is the best thing I’ve read in so long! I can honestly say this is not only going to be this year’s best romance read for me, but it will also take its place among my all-time favorites and on my must-read list of at least three times! It’s freaking good!It is an unbelievably amazing mashup of When Harry Met Sally, Love, Rosie, and One Day, with the vibes of the best ’90s Meg Ryan romcoms!The couple’s first meeting and their road trip are truly inspired by When Harry Met Sally, as the author mentioned at the end of the book. However, their 12 hilarious, inspirational, adventurous, and exciting trips, and the way the story unfolds, make you gather the clues to find the missing pieces and complete the puzzle to understand their 12-year-long friendship. It’s outstandingly smart.Poppy and Alex were so real, so powerful, so genuine! I feel like I’ve known them for a long time. They’re polar opposites, wanting different things from life. Poppy hates Linfield and khakis, while those two things are Alex’s favorites. Poppy is vivid, energetic, hyperactive, adventurous, and a risk-taker, whereas Alex is more serene, picky, bookish, calm, and controlling. Poppy never wants to settle down, desiring to experience different things in life, while Alex sticks to his routine, living in the same neighborhood, and dreaming of being a happy family man.But could wanting different things from life stop them from yearning for each other?Two years ago, something happened on their Croatia trip. Now Poppy misses her friend like crazy; she’s not happy with her life and cannot concentrate on her job. She decides to take a leap and asks her best friend for one last trip to Palm Springs to fix their relationship. What could go wrong when you’re having an adventurous holiday with your favorite person?Right!?I don’t want to give any spoilers, but I can only say one thing: there’s a part in the last third where Poppy gives a powerful and bold speech at the bar. The speech made me cry for at least three hours! My husband finally lost control and put duct tape over my mouth to make me shut up. I think I’m also suffering from dry eye syndrome. I may have shed at least five gallons of tears, and I think I’m out of tears for a long time! But that emotional speech and the entire book made my entire year!I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!Okay, I’m stopping now! I’m giving five gazillion stars to this amazing book, and I’m specifically giving the last third the entire galaxy!I’m a million times thankful to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this fantastic reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter"
Silver Elite,Dani Francis,4.08,"— 1/5 star ☆i received this book as an ARC, and i hated it. after initially leaving a one-line review, I was bombarded with comments demanding an explanation which I deleted because seeing them gave me a headache. i firmly believe that I don’t owe anyone a justification for disliking a book — it’s a free country, after all — but I’m also open to discussion. so, let’s talk about why this book was trash in my humble opinion 😊to put it bluntly: I never dnf books. whether it’s a standalone I’m not enjoying or a long series I’ve lost interest in, I always see it through to the end. so when I actually put this book down at 72%, fully intending to quit, that says everything. and even though I did eventually finish it a couple days later, it wasn’t because I was hooked — it was because I forced myself to push through. it was that bad. I truly and I mean truly wanted to love this book. the feedback that the arc readers have given made me start it in the best mood ever!! fully believing it’s gonna be four or five stars.If I had to sum Silver Elite up in one sentence, it would be this: death of substance.I’ll start with the author’s own words. In a Q&A, when asked what inspired her to write this dystopian novel (a genre known for its complex themes, political undertones, and societal critique) she replied:
“I was craving a dystopian fix! I’m a huge fan of dystopian stories, especially ones with kick-ass female leads. But I find that a lot of these types of books are for young adult readers, and I’ve always wanted to find a series that’s on the spicier side. When I realized there weren’t a ton out there, I decided to create my own spicy dystopia.”
 to me, this reads like someone wanted to take YA dystopia and slap sex onto it. that’s fine if your goal is entertainment — not every book needs to be politically profound — but when it comes to a genre like dystopia, depth matters. these stories typically mirror real-world issues and invite critical thinking. but we got a shallow, trope-heavy romance with little to no true world-building or thematic integrity at all!! what happening here is a disconnect between the genre’s potential and the execution. the focus on romance, while not inherently bad because I LOVE romance, reduced the book to a series of tropes that are often used for cheap entertainment value. It genuinely breaks my heart that nearly every romantasy book these days aren’t original, unique stories but a recycled blend of the same tired tropes. It’s the reason so many of them end up as disappointing 2-star reads for me.Romance has its place in storytelling, but in a dystopian context, it should feel like a consequence of a deeply troubled society, not a distraction from it. the lack of meaningful world-building is a huge issue here. A dystopian world should feel fully realized, with a detailed backdrop of political systems, social structures, and the oppressive forces at play. you could’ve named one real incident instead of saying that. It honestly blows my mind—especially with everything going on in the world right now—that your takeaway was “I wanted dystopia and sex” instead of highlighting something meaningful or important. it’s embarrassing!!! The world is literally going upside down — in some countries women’s rights are being taken down like we’re living in the handmaid’s tale and in other countries people are dying every single day and what inspired you to write a dystopia is spice?? if you check my shelves I literally read spice day and night but this feels insulting to me. 🥴let’s take the hunger games for comparison since this book is being compared to it, the setting there isn’t just a backdrop but an active character in the story, shaping the lives and choices of the characters. here, however, it seems like the world-building was either an afterthought or barely touched upon. it’s basically a love story set in an indistinct, forgettable world—essentially a bunch of nothing. there’s no tension, no struggle, no reflection of real-world political systems or the complexities of human nature under duress.going back to the comparisons that are happening now.. the marketing comparisons to “The Hunger Games” is not only misleading — they’re insulting 😭 it lacked all the emotional weight, those immersive tension scenes, and moral complexity that made those books successful. the tagline calling wren, the fmc, “Katniss for grown-ups”? that shit is absurd!! If Katniss and wren were in the same room, Katniss would hand her spine back to her. Wren was inconsistent, she lacked conviction, and her personality seemed to reset every few chapters, she didn’t even stick to herself. and what does “for grown-ups” even mean here? Because it certainly doesn’t refer to mature themes or layered storytelling — it just means there’s sex.wren also thirsts after every single male character introduced, to the point that it becomes repetitive and exhausting. and ironically, for a book marketed around spice, the romance was forgettable to me. the chemistry wasn’t there at all they didn’t feel good together. the smut scenes felt hollow as well. there was no intimacy that made me feel anything. I kept seeing people rave about the mmc, cross, and I genuinely wondered if I’d read a different book. I couldn’t remember a single meaningful thing he said or did LMAO.he left no impression on me. he was built from the most basic template of a love interest: broody, mysterious, “dangerous” but soft for her—except there was no substance beneath the tropes. a backstory that was give to thousands of mmcs before him. no motivations I cared about. he was a placeholder, not a person.the plot was an incoherent rollercoaster of pacing issues. Sudden bursts of “action” or dramatic stakes were immediately followed by several chapters of absolute nothingness. the story didn’t feel like it was building toward something. the book was existing solely for a few pre-planned moments and snappy lines that can go viral. it was a patchwork of scenes that hoped you’d be too distracted to notice there was no depth holding them together. it’s giving powerless trilogy 😭 the writing itself has to be some of the most soulless, robotic prose I’ve encountered. I say this with no exaggeration: AI-generated writing could felt warmer and more human. there was no voice, no emotion, no cadence. Just clinical sentences doing the bare minimum to string scenes together.let’s also kill the “fourth wing” comparisons while we’re at it. and this is coming from someone who has critiqued the empyrean series before. but if that series did one thing right, it was being addictive. I couldn’t put it down. but silver elite? I was fighting to stay awake. it doesn’t just fail to live up to that level of addictiveness, it isn’t even in the same realm. this was a slog, not a sprint.— thank you random house (del rey) for an arc!!──────── ✿ ─────────the initial one liner review: reading this book felt like a death eater kept performing the cruciatus curse on my poor innocent body for 500 pages!!","Infinite stars!

This book is my Roman empire.

""Maybe our choices are the catalysts that set the course of events in motion. Maybe our fate isn't so much predetermined as it is influenced by the decisions we make""
Tell me why I loved this book so much?? I was so excited for it!! Like my expectations were through the roof but it still managed to surpass them?? It's literally the bane of my existence. It consumed my soul, it had me hooked so bad!! it did not let me go, honestly, I tried to get up and do my work but I would find myself tucked in my bed with my Ipad because this book was so damn addicting!! AHH stupid me decided to read this on the most busy week of my life, I literally missed my assignments deadline because I was reading this and I had to beg my professor to accept :) (He gave me a lecture but he accepted it(the lecture was as long as the class)) but this was so worth doing that like I actually do not care I would skip my assignment and read it all over again if I had to and I envy all of you so much for being able to read it again for the first time :( I want that again. Buddy reading this with Iqra made this book even more fun, like we were so in sync and we binged it sooo fast. Everything that could go right for a book, fortunately, went right here.The writing style was simply amazing, it was honestly easy to follow, I kind of predicted some of the plot twist but there were one or two that caught me off guard, the way it's written is so easy to grab your attention like I honestly cant get past 10pm these days but it had me awake till 4 am, simply, because I could not resist. This book is a siren, I'm afraid. This honestly gave me what Fourth Wing couldn't, even though I liked fw's first book this was 10x better, like pull all the good stuff from fourth wing amplify it and all the bottled potential and ace that and you'll get Silver Elite. The academy setting made me it a more enjoyable experience because I just have a soft spot for settings like that. The friendships, the romance, the plot, everything was balanced so well that I honestly had no complaints except for how short this books was (It's 516 pages) It can easily be 1500. Also the sense of nostalgia was so strong with this one because it's written in a way where it took me back to the 2010's dystopian era while remaining unique with it's own idea and I loved that feeling so much!! Like I was craving it so bad. I also feel like the letters and the test results that were at the end of some of the chapters will help people enjoy this book more!!MY FAVOURITE PART: The Characters;Wren Darlington, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her. Okayy, so I always loved her and I didn't feel annoyed at all. I enjoyed her development throughout the book and I really liked how her character shaped up to be but I just felt very connected to her, I was enjoying reading her pov, her inner monologue so much that I wasn't bothered, she was so badass like if you want a strong badass fmc, look no further. She was actually such a diva lmao she had everyone fooled and I loved reading her deceive people. She was so cocky and sarcastic but not too overly quirky, she wasn't weak and got shit done and honestly it's been so long since I've read about an fmc who has had in this extreme of a chokehold like ufffff her badassery was so hott and I love how she never felt insecure, she knew she was good enough and pretended to be bad just for her mission and she atee.Cross Redden, A MAN, A MAN, A ma-ma-ma-mannn. If you think Wren was amazing, breathtaking, beautiful, hot?? wait till you meet Cross he was so charming like he had this irresistible charm. This bitch wouldn't even do anything at times but the hotness would be radiating off of him and woohooo I was fanning myself. The things he said, he did had me creasing. He knew how to vex Wren and he did it in the best way, his comments on Wren's tests had howling because it was soo funny, we also love a man who's jealous and admits it right int he fmc's face that he is. I knew he was a softie at the core of his heart because the things he did <33 the action scenes didnt help reduce his hotness, they amplified it, the descriptions were so yum. This never happens, the last time I liked both the male and female character to this extent was when I was reading tog and before that was when I read the mindfuck series, so, to see characters who I could love like that felt so refreshing to read.Side characters, I really enjoyed the cast of side characters that were presented to us. They had the perfect amount of page time, it wasn't too overpowering and it also wasn't underwhelming, we had Kaine, I liked him a lot and I really liked his humor as well, the banter that he brought and the way his character was written and the way his actions foreshadowed the future was really fun to read. Xavier, I actually like him and I did find him cute at times BUT why was he so susss. Lydia, I never trusted and never will trust this raggedy ass bitch. Ivy, she was cool, I wanna see more of her in the next book!! Roe, ahahaha he reminded of that guy I forgot his name but that greasy bitch from throne of glass that we hated so much in kingdom of ash but make him more unhinged, insecure and psychotic, you'll get roe.The romance, WHERE DO I EVEN START!!!!! It was everything, I was a little hesitant when it started because it was lusty when it started and I was like hmm idk how to feel about it but the development was top notchhh, there were bits of a love triangle but it gets resolved within the book and its not overly influenced on the book and even tho the love triangle made me conflicted I always knew Cross would be the endgame loll like Kaine would do cute stuff and try to steal my heart but Cross would just open his mouth and we all would be Team Cross, it was enemies to lovers to an extent, it had angst, a little bit of slow burn, forced proximity, natural chemistry, the sexual tension was off the charts, and the spicy scenes were soooo hot like she delivered. I have never been thsi passionate over a debut book!! It was so good I wanna cry cuz I know I'll never experience anything like this for such a long timeeeee. I love books like this but i hate the aftermath.The plot and the worldbuilding were so good, they were given ample of time and it was just overall well balanced, i was so invested in it and I wanted to know what was going to happen next, each chapter left me wanting more. The plot twists were so enjoyable and gave this story an edge I liked learning about the past, there were the last few chapters that fucked with my brain so hard that I wanted to cryyy ugh writing this review is making me wanna reread it already like I Honestly did not know who trust and its set up so good, the letters, the way they act, its all written so well that it makes you question your sanity. The base work of the worldbuilding was there, it wasn't in detail but it was enough for me to be satisfied and not notice its lacking but I would like to see it expand in the next books.Overall, the best book of the year for me!! definitely read it.P.S; I highlighted so many quotes but I removed this book from my kindle and they go deleted :(_Guys I've been trying to read my cr but my minds still stuck on this 😭__I haven't even read the last chapter but I'm telling you this book is my favourite book of the year. I love it sooooooo much .___I have heard such good things about this book!! and I am so happy that I got an ARC, let's hope it meets my expectations.-Buddy reading with IqraThank you to Netgalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone for giving me an E-Arc of this book*","MY FAVOURITE BOOK OF THIS YEARRR!!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️Imagine that one book that had ur heart racing, blood pumping, fighting sleep for one more chapter, giggling blushing biting the tip of ur finger while twirling ur hair whenever the main characters interact, soo sickkk when u read a crazy plot twist, fascinated by the world, gives u that nostalgic feeling, basically making u emo for the characters the plot the action the romance??? Yeah, well, that was this book for me xxIf the x men and divergent had a love child it would be this book.   The second I finished this book I SLEPT for seven hrs straight 😭 the way this book had me fighting sleep but also wide awake for it too. Like I had adrenaline pumping thru my veins I was feeling such a rushhhhI litch found it the worst act in history to have to put this book down to do anything else like feeding myself or talking to ppl. LIKE THIS IS NOT THE TIMEEE I NEED TO DEVOWWER THE BOOK OR ILL IMPLODEIt had EVERYTHING I was looking for. It being set in an academy too?? i felt like a caveman who just saw fire for the first time 🧚‍♀️. The plot, the action, the romance, the tension and chemistry, the amazing world building. Everything was so perfectly balanced and evenly placed in the book. It all had a time and a reason. In no way is this peak masterful literature but it was a good time and the vibes were sooo buzzy I couldn’t get enough! Most of the plot twists were kinda predictable but some weren’t and I loved that. I went in with no expectations except knowing the blurb sounded like it would be something I’d enjoy and turns out I was right. There was not a single dry page IM TELLING U 🤚 like u’d think it would be crazy amounts of info dumping but it wasn’t — the world building was so accessible and interesting while also being intricate and detailed. Gahhh pls I wanna gobble this book again I don’t feel like leaving. Wren, the fmc, is so loveable and amazing. It’s been a MINUTE since I’ve loved on an fmc this much. Especially in the fantasy genre it’s harder for me to relate or her to become someone I would love or be friends with but wren?? She’s sister material. I never not once got annoyed with her because she was genuinely smart and savvy it didn’t feel forced or like a gimmick. She was good at the shit she knew and acknowledged when she wasn’t so she took it on herself to learn. She’s also the sweetest girl everrr like she can be snarky and sarcastic but also vulnerable too 😩 I love her so much 🥹 she’s been thru sooo much ugh I wanna protect her with my whole chest. CROSS??? THATS MY MAN I CLAIM HIM‼️ he is everything I look for in an mmc. Miss Francis rlly took every want out of my brain and said dinners on me. So who am I to deny a delicacy? 😋💋The brutal sarcasm that gets you laffing louder than a hyena on crack, the quiet soft spot for her, to then PATHETIC always only for her, is competent in his job, gets shit done, doesn’t talk much but only with herrr- he’s litch this and moreee I cannot do him justice u just have to read it 🤚 no bc this man was HUNGRY for his girl. The way he never shied away from how he felt. GOD. He was sooooo blunt about how he NEEDED her — eye rolling toe curling shit like you wouldn’t believeeeeeee the crazy tension.  This guy had no chill and I was licking my fingers, smacking my lips, wiping the plate kleannhhhh. I’m talking I had to savour every interaction every glance every passing jab at each other 🫦🫦🫦🫦 God.

Better Than the Movies,Lynn Painter,4.27,"(2.5/5)To say that I disliked this book would be somewhat of an understatement.My first problem with this book was that Liz, the main character, was absolutely infuriating. The writing read like it was a not-like-other-grills YA contemporary romance from 2010, which, honestly, except for the year, is exactly what this book is.Ever since her mother died when she was young, Liz has been obsessed with rom-coms and finding her movie-worthy happily-ever-after. Enter Michael, the neighborhood boy she was (and still is??) in love with when she was literally in kindergarten, and Wes, the infuriating boy-next-door. One of them is going to help her get the other. You know where I'm going with this.Honestly speaking, it was painful to see Liz adamantly going after Michael even after a) it seemed like fAtE wAs TrYiNg To KeEp ThEm ApArt, and b) his most appealing trait was his SoUtHeRn DrAwL. Like, umm, no thank you? And then there's the fact that Liz hadn't actually seen him or talked to him since elementary school, but was still in love with him. Seriously. Liz is better at romanticizing her life than me when I have six assignments to finish for school and three hours to do them all.It was even more painful to see how she was slowly isolating herself from everyone around her, except Wes, and how somehow, in some way, most of her problems stemmed from the fact that she never really got any closure from her mother's death. That part might have actually been tragic, but it wasn't addressed very well until the end, and everything else was annoying.Specifically, all of her gushing over Michael was just not it. I was disgusted and cringing every five minutes, to the point where I had to pause the audiobook and do history homework to attempt to burn the scenes from my mind multiple times. It was not fun, to say the least.That being said, the audiobook was actually quite good. I think I would have jumped out a window if I was actually reading this book in text format, but somehow, the audiobooks narrator's ability was enough to keep me from taking such drastic methods of escape. The narrator was magically able to keep me at least somewhat interested in the happenings of the book, and their voice is one of the two saving graces of my reading experience.The only character I could really tolerate was Wes. Poor, poor Wes. I'm going to say it right now: Wes did not deserve everything that Liz made him go through. The dude has been simping after her since they were children, and agrees to help her get another dude just because he likes spending time with her?? Get this man a medal. And maybe a back brace for carrying the entire book on his shoulders.I won't deny that Wes and Liz's relationship was cute, but at the same time, while it was developed a lot throughout the course of the book, I never felt that we were given the outcome of that development. It was always very two steps forward, three steps back with them. There were a lot of tropes both used and spoken about in this book, and I felt that they were alright, but nothing too special. The plot in general was actually quite nice, the only thing that really ruined this book for me was Liz's character herself, and her inability to communicate with literally anyone in her life.Overall, I felt that this book had a lot of potential to actually be a cute and interesting, light-hearted story. Unfortunately for us, the main character makes you want to tear your hair out and then set it on fire, even if her love-interest is the human equivalent of cotton candy. I'll be honest and say that I was expecting more, especially from the MC, but if you're able to ignore that sort of stuff, I'd definitely recommend this as a sweet, quick romance if you're looking for one.","UPDATE! i finally read the sequel🤩 (01/08/25)
“Enemies-to-lovers—it’s our trope, Buxbaum."" 4.9/5 :)
~the actual soundtrack of Wessy and Libby~
A rom-com with rom-com references, fake dating and enemies to lovers, all while the MCs are neighbors and childhood friends frienamies??! This was like a dream come true.A certain someone didn’t realize why he was calling her Buxbaum until like halfway through the book… and then they realized that’s her last name… totally not me~cons that I remember~Unfortunately I think this book just spoiled the entire plot of The Great Gatsby…Also, I wish the characters could stop thinking ""what the hell"", please. That phrase can get annoying after a while. Maybe change it up each time or just say something like ""why not"".Sometimes I don't understand how Liz thinks because I can't connect with her. But I guess when the supposed 'love of your life' is standing in front of you, it's hard to always act rationally. She might seem a bit 'not like the other girls', but that's part of who she is and I like her for it. She could be a little slow and oblivious sometimes (especially when it comes to her love life…)~pros that I can think of right now~I know it'll never happen to me, but the story actually sounds realistic. Some girl who's been unlucky all her life turns out to be not so unlucky after all… *continues to daydream*When they were stargazing and eating s’mores in his backyard, OMG IT WAS SO CUTE!I love the quotes at the beginning of each chapter. The rom-com references also fit in very nicely, although i never seen/read any of them.Helena is my favorite character in here. She's such a cool and chill person, yet she was treated so unfairly for something she can't even change. She seems more like a good friend than a mom. I wish I have a friend like her…I was really shipping Wessy and Libby so the minor flaws doesn't really affect me. It shows how much I liked this story :)Recommend to everyone!! Especially fans of Tweet Cute! (not to be that person, but this reminded me of it)Overall, an amazing rom-com that made me cry and laugh and smile. A cute book with a cute cover. This book is now my favorite rom-com ever. :)03/12/21are rom-coms supposed to make you cry? or am i just too emotional while reading…?i’m genuinely curious 👀━━━━━━━━━━━༻༻❁༺༺━━━━━━━━━━━if only my life were better than the movies...","— 5 stars ✰
“she’s not you.““what?”“she. isn’t. you.”
this was my first lynn painter book and i’m honestly shocked to say that i ended up LOVING this book. i mean hello?? i thought i was over highschool romances but she really did an amazing job with this ya novel because istg i couldn’t stop giggling. she really made me feel like a middle-schooler again because i caught myself grinning like an idiot like.. a bunch of times🫡better than the movies is about liz buxbaum. a seventeen year-old teenager, a hopeless romantic and a daydreamer through and through. when her childhood crush michael returns to their town, she wants to impress him big time. for the better or worse, it seems like her archenemy next door, wesley bennet, is hitting it off with her beloved crush. with the help of wes, she hopes to win michael over and go to prom with him.. what could go wrong, right?— liz is a hopeless romantic, everything that happens in her life — she compares it to a movie, a romcom. she seeks that picture perfect love story but sometimes she is chasing something that isn’t really worth it. i had my problems with liz in the beginning, but she definitely grew on me. while i was mad at her for lying to her best friend, i kind of understood where it was coming from and as we follow her through her story, we see her growth and development.— wes-my-beloved-bennet. i love him, you love him, everyone loves him. charming, witty, funny, athletic. yes, he is all that. liz never really looked at him like that tho, for her he was just the annoying neighbor who teased her. but slowly she notices why everyone loves him and that is the moment we, as a reader, fall in love with him as well. the banter between him and liz was incredibly cute and SO swoon-worthy. the way he remembered all the small details about her, i literally died dead. 💗💕💞🩷
“you look best when you’re you.”
did i mention the tension? god, the tension in this book 😮‍💨we really get everything in this book — childhood nemesis, drama, lots and lots of jealousy, friends to lovers but, some more drama. but overall just an amazing comfort read. this is just a book i will get back to when i need something cute to lighten up my mood, make me blush and giggle. maybe even make me scream into my pillow.wes bennet, I LOVE YOU !"
The Love Hypothesis,Ali Hazelwood,4.12,"I want to say this is a case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” But then again, isn’t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?The Love Hypothesis follows Olive, a PhD student who wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive’s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.Olive is a woman in STEM, but that is really all she is. I admit, I loved this representation, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she’s not American (she’s Canadian), she’s not male, and she’s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it’s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it’s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she’s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I’m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in. Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.Other than that, there was nothing. One part of the problem is Adam himself. Adam felt very, very bland. It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it’s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially from Olive. I usually like fictional men like him, even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new, but this case didn’t work for me. You could say he needed much more seasoning.Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn’t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5”8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that’s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive’s mind (since it’s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I’ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. The whole book, we don’t really know what Olive looks like or what she likes, and all we know about Adam is that he is a young, hot-shot professor who hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. Oh, and we can’t forget that he’s big, especially when you’re reminded every fucking page. That was it.Speaking of, Olive’s personality also felt a little childish sometimes. The situation that led to Olive kissing Adam (without knowing, of course) is completely unrealistic, so it’s one you need to put your logic to the side for. It made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date. Because . . . yeah, that’s the actual situation. Olive’s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive’s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it’s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she’s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.Pretty unrealistic scenario for a PhD student, if you ask me. Also, it’s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum, specifically demisexuality. It’s briefly mentioned in the beginning (even the term is used) and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam, “It’s not that I want to not have sex. I just . . . don’t particularly want to have it. There is something weird about my brain, and my body, and—I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t seem to be able to experience attraction like other people. Like normal people. I tried to just . . . just to do it, to get it over with, and the guy I did it with was nice, but the truth is that I just don’t feel any . . .” She closed her eyes. This was difficult to admit. “I don’t feel any sexual attraction unless I actually get to trust and like a person, which for some reason never happens. Or, rarely. It hadn’t, not in a long time, but now—I really like you, and I really trust you, and for the first time in a million years I want to—” For starters, I literally got second-hand embarrassment, and second, I can’t help but wish it was was expanded more on. It was as if the author just wanted to add more to Olives lacking personality so she sprinkled some pretty damn humiliating ace representation. Many people might not realize how ignorant it really is when you take a misrepresented and underrepresented sexual orientation and make your character say “there is something wrong with [her] brain,” making it seem like she “isn’t normal” because she experiences sexual attraction differently than “normal people”. Saying this is stereotypical, ignorant, and generally rude.Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating. But all good things must come to an end. Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the first real kiss, feeling the comfort of the other’s touch, realizing you’re falling for for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn’t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced that I wondered how the two would develop feelings. They were also in moments where they had been “dating” for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn’t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren’t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they weren't friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole “We're dating, so we need people to see us” scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they’re fake dating. They just felt boring.While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn’t understand how or why Adam liked Olive. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn’t anything to appreciate.Olive first had a crush on Adam, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into “I love him” mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don’t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue. And the sex scene? We don't talk about it.I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn’t laugh at anything. Well, I did laugh at the stupidity of this book. The side characters also felt too immature for me, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) were ridiculous and could have been solved easily if they literally just talked like the ‘adults’ they were. Overall, The Love Hypothesis had zero appreciation from me. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull. So if you’re still interested in reading this, please ignore me and my emotionless heart right now and give it a chance. You might end up finding a new favorite if you think about it. If not, then you can join me, and we can question our feelings together.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","idk what kind of drugs y’all are on but i evidently did not receive my portionmaybe manvi is right and i just really hate popular booksbut, this was just… not good?the pure 
agony
 of having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about iti actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he’s not happy.this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can’t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let’s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i’m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn’t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of „raising“ good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of „buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him“. first of all, have you considered that you’re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive’s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict. there’s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man’s physical attributes and if it’s not the eyes it’s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big. HUGE. ENORMOUS. A FUCKING GIANT. HE HAS MUSCLES. I GET IT!!!!!! HIS FINGERS ARE MASSIVE AND SO IS HIS DICK. GREAT.you didn’t have to tell me in every paragraph though. i know i have shit memory but i am not close to dementia yet. once or twice would have been enough. like what do you want me to do? shall i applaud him? good job growing, i guess you ate your carrots as a kid, go you!have i mentioned that this book could have been 350 pages shorter if they had just talked to each other? communication, so important.this book started every chapter with a hypothesis except that most of them weren’t actually hopotheses but who cares. who cares. wait… my test theory prof is calling and i think he does. other than that, the science was actually the best part of the book. also the criticism of the bad working conditions of phd students was very well done. i’m only a master’s student but a phd might be in my future plans and i can already feel the poverty, so #relatable.there were only two chapters i liked: chapter 16 and chapter 20. small spoiler ahead.chapter 16 is the sex chapter and in chapter 20 a certain character gets called out on their behaviour and adam does this sexy thing of nearly beating them up.having read another review that has quoted chapter 16 though… ugh… cringe. idk what i was on reading this. in my defense i haven’t seen my boyfriend in a week so maybe i was feeling touch starved.also, there's this very fine line between finding your partner so sexy that you can't control yourself and premature ejaculation. i am not saying that adam belongs in the second category. but i am.i still stand by my opinion that chapter 20 was sexy.i did actually like adam even though he’s a very stereotypical grumpy-only-drinks-black-coffee-and-eats-broccoli kind of character. he is definitely kinda bland. but maybe i just like my men bland *shrugs*.i have like zero opinions on olive though. she was there i guess. all in all: i don’t think this book has done anything new or swoon worthy. the characters were average. the story was average. the writing was average. i don’t really get why everyone is so crazy about it. i guess the STEM aspect was fun but even that has been done before i think?overall, i was mainly bored and infuriated by the amount of unnecessary drama and height descriptions. you all do you i guess. but i’ll do me: 1.5 stars","once upon a time, i read this book, and despite the fact that i have a heart of darkness (sorry joseph conrad) and am full of hate and vitriol (makes me a fun gossip though) and eat romance novels for breakfast (as in am very picky about them - i'm actually not a big breakfast eater)...i enjoyed it.and then i read everything else that this author has ever written, and i hated all of it.and when to came time to revisit...well, welcome to judgment day.i hated this too.maybe most of all.(well, almost most of all. a love interest putting our protagonist's entire boob in his mouth is still not quite as terrifying and unsexy and jail-worthy as j*cking *ff into the discarded bra of the girl you s*xually *ssaulted, a real thing that happens multiple times in an actual ali hazelwood novella.)i am an adult woman. i am tall. my hair is a normal, non-neon or -pastel color. i own zero pairs of knee-high socks with lisa frank prints on them, i am capable of feeding myself, and i do not live my life between instances of awe-inspiring misogyny from men that only other men can rescue me from.this is a relatively typical list of traits, i think, and yet these details completely prevent me from enjoying even a moment of any given ali hazelwood I-Big-You-Small-Let's-Spend-40-Pages-Talking-About-How-I-Can't-Fit-Inside-You ""romance.""c'est la vie.bottom line: i officially give up on sunshine, rainbows, love, and happiness. and also this author.---------------------original reviewExcuse me a moment. I just have to give myself a little pep talk. Won't take more than a paragraph or two.Okay, Emma. I know you - gag - felt...feelings during this book. I know you were invested in the romance in a way that you have rarely been invested in anything that can remotely be construed as warm and cozy and positive. Your most-watched movie is Spotlight and when you were at home alone for a week you spent it rewatching Mindhunter and You. Your heart is typically shale-esque, in hardness and brittleness and darkness. So I know that you're tempted to give five stars for the fact that it cracked your Grinchy shell and made your heart grow three sizes or whatever, but no.This is not a perfect book even though reading it was, like, a near-perfect experience.Even I, who thinks the miscommunication part of any romance is the best part due to the fact that is the most angsty and suffering-based, thought there were about 7 miscommunications too many here.And I could have used a bit more personality from our love interest. Maybe, I don't know, actually I take that back because men should leave being fun and characterized to women, who do it better.Okay. End pep talk because it isn't working. This is an insanely cute and skipped-heartbeat-inducing book and I want to give it five stars for that alone.Maybe I'll come back to it.Bottom line: Yippee! There's nothing more fun than enjoying a romcom!---------------pre-reviewthis is an extremely cute book that simultaneously rivals normal people in anxiety-inducing miscommunication.review to come / 4 stars!!!---------------tbr reviewscience nerds fake dating!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Casey McQuiston,4.06,"I am a soulless void. I have definitely said this before, but I don’t know if you’ve really HEARD me. And they say actions speak louder than words, so here I am.Taking this book, which everyone has hailed as pure joy / cookie-level sweetness / the greatest romance of our generation even though it’s fictional / overall so happiness-bringing it seems like it should be relegated to black market dealings…Rereading it...and dropping a three point five rating (already gives a Scrooge-like aura of grumpiness) to...two point five. (DON’T HURT ME.)And generally being so discombobulated and displeased that I have to write a whole new review.(If you know anything about me, you know I am too lazy to write multiple reviews of one book unless the circumstances are truly life-ending-ly dire. That’s where we’re at.)This just. Did not do it for me.Let’s talk about why, in bullet points, so as to hopefully limit my wordiness and therefore limit how mad at me you guys will be (please don’t yell at me I am already heartless and depressed):- THE ROMANCE: First time I read this, I felt like the human equivalent of a waffle. Sweet and fluffy and, uh, delicious. (I didn’t have a third one.) This time, the plot (which is just romance) never grabbed my attention, and the cheesy love story...grated. (Get it? Because cheese? Come on, now you can’t yell at me. That was too good.)- THE SMUT: Okay, I’ll admit this is personal preference. I don’t like when there’s too much smut in a book. That’s a me problem, however, and usually I will remedy it by just not reading it. However if I had skipped all explicit scenes in this book, I would only have a pamphlet trying to get me to join the fictional perfect glorified Democratic Party in my hands. (But more on that later.) Anyway, a romance that is 99% either sexting or sex is not convincing or fun for me. Sorry.- THE CHARACTERS: I love Bex or Bea (I think it’s Bea), and I love Henry’s friend whose name I can’t remember (is it Pez? Or is that just a candy), I love June and Nora so much I would marry them, and also remember their names, which is apparently high praise for me. Henry and Alex, however...I hate very much. They are annoying. Alex is obnoxious and made me feel like either a) a person with a hangover yelling at the still-drunk people to shut up or b) a grumpy old man telling snot-nosed children from the 1950s to get out of his yard. Henry is just boring.- THE POLITICS: This is, by far, the WORST thing about this book. It’s what got my first read to drop from presumably 5 to 3.5. Single-handedly. And it’s even more gruesome the second time. This is the most idealized, grotesque, good-versus-evil look at politics I have EVER SEEN. In this book, the Democrats are a rainbow-wearing gloriously diverse coalition of kumbaya-singing angels, and everyone else is a villain we won’t talk about. Democrats are 100% motivated purely by the love of Doing The Right Thing, and they have never done anything wrong, ever, in their lives. The American people love them implicitly and will turn historically red states blue just to show them that. It’s not only sickening, it’s damaging. DO NOT IDEALIZE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE NOT CELEBRITIES. Don’t you think I want to get EMMA + AOC tattooed on my lower back? I do. But I won’t because she is a person who is driven to power, and all of those people have flaws.In the interest of full transparency, I am a leftist, so I by definition think the Democrats are a little better than the Republicans. But I mostly think that glorifying parties is f*cked up and wrong, and results in things like sainting Pelosi and falling in love with Fauci and generally being unable to hold people accountable for doing their job (which is representing you), and therefore results in corruption and useless politicians and the end of the world.Dramatic enough for a stopping point?Bottom line: Before you guys start yelling at me, can anyone refer me to a good dentist? I got a cavity in every tooth from how saccharine this book is.--------------------reread pre-reviewrounding this rating down because the overall political fanfiction vibe is a lot harder to ignore on round 2. potential updated review to come / was 3.5 stars, might be 3 now----------reread updatesstarting the year as i mean to go on: buddy reading with lily--------------------original reviewTHIS IS THE CUTEST FLUFFIEST BOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.This made me...blush? And I famously cannot blush. One time my high school English teacher overheard me saying I didn’t do the assigned reading and he called me out in front of the whole class, and I, like a tiny badass (pretending my heart wasn’t pounding and I wasn’t more nervous than I’ve ever been), was like “Yeah, I’m not trying to hide anything. I didn’t do the reading.” And he, taken aback, went, “...You’re not even blushing.”So, to recap: me, a school-obsessed profoundly shy 15-year-old being called out in front of all her very cool peers by her scary old man teacher = no blushing.The sheer adorableness of this book = Blush City, population me.CASEY MCQUISTON IS A STAR.This book has:- amazing banter- the best side characters - fantastic friendships - so much humor (I laughed! At a book! When does that HAPPEN!) - tons of angst (actually too much angst sometimes - I got a little tired of this book towards the end) - a great meet cute (except not actually a meeting. A re-meet-cute? Can I coin a term?)- the best idea for a forbidden / enemies-to-lovers romance EVER!!! No exaggeration.So, in short, Casey McQuiston is, after just one book, a complete auto-buy author for me.However.This was not a perfect book. And in truth it made me cringe many times.Like, yes, on the one hand everyone is right and this is the cutest, fluffiest, most fun read of all time.On the other hand...I do not want my politics to be cute-fluffy-fun. I do not want them to be revisionist history where the current administration is absurdly well motivated and diverse and perfect and there is no corruption or back-hallway negotiation at all. It’s not realistic and to be honest, it makes me cringe.If I wanted an idealized-to-the-point-of-unbelievability fictional American president, I’d watch the West Wing and ignore the bigoted parts.I also think the scene with the Queen of England was Cringe Central. Again, not realistic, just completely good politics versus completely bad politics depending on which better serves the plot.This just felt...very juvenile. And I’m not saying that romance novels need to have the best ever take on politics. I’m not even saying that I was reading this book FOR the politics.All I’m saying is...I care about politics and seeing it idealized and completely unrealistic took me out of the story??(Can I say the word politics more.)Anyway. Even that was not enough to take away from this book so much for it to be a negative rating or an unenjoyable read.But...it was a takeaway. (SORRY.)Bottom line: Casey McQuiston give me your next book immediately please, and also thank you for not writing it about politics. (OKAY I’M DONE USING THE WORD POLITICS NOW.)--------------------original pre-reviewnothing but respect for MY (alternate reality where the fictional president from this book is the actual) presidentreview to come / 3.5 stars--------------------tbr reviewi'm a simple girl. i see a bajillion five star reviews of a contemporary, i read that contemporary","me, awkwardly watching all the raving reviews for this book and being scared to give my pretty negative, highly unpopular yet ultimately very honest opinion:Ok, so please don't hate me, I'm fragile.But also, in all seriousness, I didn't like this book. I know, I know, how dare I? Well, let me explain to you in detail just how I dare. Beware of the long review!A few months ago, everyone was getting ARCs for this book and absolutely everyone was loving it and giving it five stars. Obviously, I was pretty hyped up for this one, as you can imagine. I knew I had to read it, and I knew, just knew, that I was going to love the crap out of it! It was looking to be one of my favorites of 2019!Except, that's not really how it all went down.I mean, don't get me wrong! It didn't absolutely suck, nor was it the worst book I've ever read. It was nice. It had its cute moments. I actually laughed at some parts. I just wanted more. I wanted a cuteness overload. I wanted to fall head over heels into this story, I wanted to love these charcters, I wanted this to be a five-star read!It wasn't. Obviously.I've been reading a bucket load of contemporary romances lately and it's all in the hope that I'll find something to make this cold little heart of mine melt! I want something akin to The Hating Game, a book that killed me, revived me, and killed me again, twice over because that's how many times I read it in the span of 24 hours.But, alas, my search for such a book has proven futile as no other contemporary romance will do. And I'm so, very sorry to say, but Red, White & Royal Blue didn't even come close.Now to the review!Maybe this book is heavily overhyped or maybe I'm just a miserable, heartless girl. Both are possible, but either way, I had a lot of problems with this book and I'm not gonna pretend otherwise.No, there is no one thing that makes me think the book sucks. There is no one major flaw that I can point out and blame for my rating. If anything, my issues are a series of small things that will surely be overlooked, or even praised by the masses when the book is released.For starters, this book felt to me like it was trying way too hard at times.If this book were PG it would undoubtedly be turned into a Disney Channel movie, down to the unrealistically happy ending where we all pretend the world is made of rainbows, cotton candy, and unicorn farts.And, honestly, I wouldn't necessarily mind that. I love happy endings. If the book had been only about romance, it would have been fine. But, the book insisted on shoving politics down my throat and the overidealized ending seemed forced, disingenuous, and so utterly predictable! It also felt like the author was trying to force a political view on us.The world the book shows is what ours would look like through rose-colored glasses. It's a world where the female president of the United States is a white, Texan democrat. Where leaked personal emails have no impact on presidential elections. Where a royal prince believes empires are the literal devil, despite benefiting from the monarchy in every single way possible. Where First Son of the U.S. and the British Prince would go everywhere without anyone taking a picture and being surrounded by a million bodyguards. Also, their affair wouldn't have any global consequences that would impact international relationships not just between the U.S. and the U.K, but with every other country as well.It's also a world where people who don't buy into this PC world are demonized for their beliefs. Where if you aren't on board with the particular brand of politics that the author is selling, then you might as well be the devil incarnate. In the end, there are no consequences to anything. It made all the obstacles between the romance seem weak and insubstantial. The author put so much focus on the laughable politics that I couldn't help but roll my eyes.  She tried to tackle racism, international relationships, homophobia, complicated family drama, equality, imperialism, and just about every other social issue currently being talked about, all while also trying to deliver a good romance.And it didn't work!The politics in this book seemed so forced! And so unnecessary. They made the book drag on for ages. Seriously though, there was no need for this book to end up being 432 pages long! That's just uncalled for.So yes, maybe I am heartless. I'm willing to accept that now.Those things I mentioned are ones that a lot of people are undoubtedly gonna find cute. People are gonna argue that 'the book doesn't have to be realistic!' and I agree. It's just so insanely unbelievable and so politically forced that I could help but be incredibly annoyed by it. Sorry. But also, I'm not sorry.This was supposed to be a cute, romance about two adorable gay boys falling in love! Not a book about idealized political views. If it had been only a romance novel, I would have liked it more, although honestly, not by much.I liked some of the dialogue. I laughed sometimes. It was cute. But sometimes the characters felt off to me. Like they were trying so hard to be relatable and likable that they broke their established characteristics. Also, the very premise of the book is enemies to lovers and it’s not really even that In the end, this book just wasn't for me, I think. Many of you will love it. I'm sure of it. I just couldn't love it how I wanted. There were too many subplots, too many social issues trying to become part of the main story. I think a book that did this better was The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue. And not to be that person that compares all the gay books, but I think that one was better at weaving everything in there in ways relevant to the plot and showing realistic consequences of the character's choices.I went into this book expecting one thing. I got something else instead, and in the end, I think that's the real problem. If I'm honest, all the issue I mentioned are things that in a book I enjoyed, I might have overlooked. Sadly, this wasn't that book. Hopefully, you all have better luck with it and please be respectful of my opinion. My issue with the book has nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ aspect, it has to do with the overall execution.Also, just a warning, this book is NOT, Young Adult. It contains explicit sexual content!**I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.**Follow Me Here Too: My Blog || Twitter || Bloglovin' || Instagram || Tumblr || Pinterest","I recieved this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This book is going to avoid rightful criticism because it’s a “fun, fluffy” romance novel and “isn’t supposed to be that serious.” There’s no denying that a lighthearted story about two men falling in love is sorely missing on mainstream shelves, but we need to ask ourselves why this is the book that got picked for the “Nicholas Sparks treatment”--the $16.99 retail price, the mainstream publisher, all of the things most modern romance novels don’t get, particularly ones with LGBTQ characters. I mean, seriously, can you think of one contemporary author outside of YA who has gotten famous writing LGBTQ romance novels? What about fiction in general? I know, me neither. It’s depressing as hell. So why this book? It’s not because it’s actually good. That much is for damn sure. I have a theory. We’ll get to that in a bit. Red, White, and Royal Blue follows Alex Claremont-Diaz, a Mexican-American kid whose mom was elected president in 2016. We’re supposed to conceive of this book as a sort of gay Chasing Liberty meets Parks and Recreation: a heartfelt, optimistic, unfailingly patriotic romp where the stars are, yeah, two hot dudes, but they’re carried on the broad, benevolent shoulders of Lady Liberty. President Ellen Claremont is a white, Southern, centrist Democrat--because, sure, this is an alternate universe, but let’s not go wild--with two children, wannabe journalist June and politics-obsessed Alex. Alex’s arch nemesis for about 5 percent of the book is Prince Henry of Wales, and then he’s his secret boyfriend for the next 90 percent. At the end, they’re outed by Ellen’s political rival, which results in him soundly losing the election against her and turning Texas blue.CM writes in the acknowledgements that this book started as a fun project and, after the course of the actual 2016 election, became a sort of therapeutic, wish-fulfilling exercise. I get that; I wrote fanfiction about Pete Wentz being my boyfriend in the 6th grade, so why not a President!Hillary AU? I don’t begrudge her that. My issue is that someone else picked up this book and thought it was a good idea to publish it.There are so many little things that make this book bad: the fact that Alex and Henry are “arch rivals” for literally about ten pages until they’re kissing, and then there’s no plot for a hundred pages; this whole minor plotline where the First Family gets caught with a private email server that reads like a smug joke (“maybe this would matter in some OTHER America, but not this one!”); Alex wearing a red white and blue Gucci bomber jacket instead of a suit as if it’s some world-ending transgression; when the First Family and two of the royal siblings go to a gay bar in West Hollywood and no other patrons post any photos or sell any quotes to gossip magazines...I could honestly go on forever. These are the stupid things we’re not supposed to criticize because this is a “fun” book, so I won’t.How about instead, we talk about when Henry says “I’d rather be waterboarded...Your country could probably arrange that,” and we’re supposed to see that as a cute zinger. Or when Ellen says “My UN ambassador...said something idiotic about Israel, so now I have to call Netanyahu and personally apologize.” And then we move on to pizza and beer. The problem with this book isn’t just that it’s overly precious and poorly paced; the problem is that it is trying to be both Veep and House of Cards. It exists in a world where we are to believe that a prince “refusing the crown’s money” (as if he isn’t steeped in it, as if he doesn’t benefit from it every minute he’s alive) is somehow the apex of morality. It exists in an America where email servers don’t matter in an election. It exists in a Britain where a prince would say “One does not foster a lifelong love of Star Wars without knowing an ‘empire’ isn’t a good thing.” These cutesy one-liners and feel-good plotlines do nothing to contend with the imperial violence they’re hinting at, violence from which Alex and Henry both benefit. Okay, so Ellen chats with Netanyahu and June wants to be bffs with Ronan Farrow. Following these fun details to their logical conclusion, I can only assume that Ellen orders drone strikes in the Middle East and Henry’s grandmother is a violent racist. If I were supposed to be having a good time reading, that notion would certainly jerk me out of it quickly. The point this book misses is that it doesn’t matter how liberal the President is—the system is still a gruesome, ever-grinding machine. This book isn’t absolved from that reality, not when it makes glib references to war criminals and WikiLeaks.If this book had leaned harder into its Disney Channel inclinations, this would be a much different review. My Date With the President’s Daughter and What a Girl Wants and The Princess Diaries, all members of the canon to which this book belongs, were successful (to varying degrees) because the idea of the President or the Queen were distant, hazy fantasies rather than political and imperial figures. If Will Friedle had leveraged his relationship with President Richmond’s daughter to pass stricter gun legislation, the movie would have approximated the tone of this book. It’s a jarring, unwieldy juxtaposition.Even if we leave all of the politics out of it, there isn’t much to redeem here. The sex scenes are jarring; in a break with modern romance conventions, CM describes the undressing and kissing in vivid, pages-long detail, then quickly skirts past sex. It reads like Harry Styles/Louis Tomlinson fanfiction written by someone who gets all of the angst but none of the mechanics. And this brings us to my theory: why this goddamn book?Others have described this phenomenon in more depth--these thoughts aren’t mine alone. And I want to note before we get into it that I know CM isn’t straight. But when we look at who gets famous writing about young men falling in love with one another, we’re certainly not looking at a room full of men. By and large, the people who write this stuff are, as far as the publishing world and audiences at large perceive them, white women writing for a white woman audience. Regardless of their intentions and the complexities of their personal identities, that’s the lens through which their books are marketed and purchased. Publishers see the success of Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda and The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue and they want more of the same--big on the pining and handsome young guys, light on the details of men having sex with each other. This book isn’t coming out because it’s a beautiful tale of gay love despite challenging circumstances. It’s coming out because some suits saw dollar signs.So, let’s review: this book is painfully unaware of how painfully unaware it is; it’s an ice cream truck driving through an apocalyptic wasteland. Sure, ice cream rules, but are we just gonna ignore how utterly useless it is in the current landscape? And isn’t it a little offensive that it’s blaring “God Bless America”as it goes? Shouldn’t we feel a little miffed that someone thought to send us ice cream when we really need a damn life raft? There are many ways this book could have been a hell of a lot worse, but it’s not the story you deserve."

Update: One of my Goodreads friends brought this article to my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, and each time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating. I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly, Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings. She expressed that “as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.” This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author. Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle and Colleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist. In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.” Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen “wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father. This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful. I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me. But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him. Then we have the way that Colleen's father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a ""person who does bad things"". Now, I've been thinking about this line. I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way. Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However, from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man. We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on, he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to. Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se. I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist. So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma, it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily. It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all. I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the “I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there” line, yet Atlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor. I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age. This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book. The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas. Moreover, this expands my discontent with how Colleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious. A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle, it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book. I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame. With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle, you should not, because everything that he did, he did it consciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping (weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines. I also think it is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, because diminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow. Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover. Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book is the audience. There is this #coquette aesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic, I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover. It's pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily's plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn't a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They've transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention that I also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote ""where did you get the magnet lily"" or ""you fell down the stairs"". I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with. When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be because they call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”. That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like “There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellen and I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is “light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person, although I still question Colleen's decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is that I strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant. I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose. The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood is the internal misogyny that I see Colleen weave into her books. Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby because she believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones. What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of “what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle. This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’. It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the character Devin and how Colleen Hoover writes him as the gay stereotype. He's overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books (very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line: “A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.” I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children's names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that's obviously possible too. There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you’re okay <3━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━���━━━━","::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW ::: 

Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.

HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely 
  spoiler-free review
. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it. The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to 
everyone

Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did I just 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago (as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making.

I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . . 

Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????

Is it against the law to not use absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books???? Second . . . . 
“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”


According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . . 
“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”
Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddy Chelsea was the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it up perfectly when she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*cough Me Before You cough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . . 

To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutes super creeper Mr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s also rich and a neurosurgeon and very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months), annnnnnnnd due to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where 
“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”
 (because THAT’S going to fucking work) and then saying 
“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”
 and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining 
 “sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”
 and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero, buuuuuuuuuuuut you just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because you know he wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . . 

Nope. I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself). I went to the wholesale club yesterday and stocked up on big ol’ batch of . . . . 

I will be using it freely.Many thanks to the library for having nearly every book I ever want to read – especially books like these that are only approved to fangirling 5 Star reviewers prior to publication."
Book Lovers,Emily Henry,4.11,"✨...I would…take the vasectomy over this✨To get it out in the open: No this is not a bitter rivals book at all, no she’s really not an ice queen and it’s literally not a secret, no he is most certainly not Roy Kent (even accidentally), and no the romance isn’t ultimately central to the story. I found this to be more of a sister relationship story with a romance subplot. The romance/relationship was basically reserved acquaintances to quick fondling friends. I thought I could love it but I just couldn’t keep making excuses or trying to convince myself that the next page would have the moment I’ve been reading for.If I was really trying to start something, I’d call this Frozen fan fiction. I mean seriously the word frigid is used enough, and the amount of ice/ice queen/frozen/ice in my body/I’m literally a block of ice with eyes language is astounding.I honestly don’t foresee many people having my same reaction to this book. I think it’s a fine, easy read but absolutely nothing special. Emily Henry’s name attached will make it special to a lot of readers and that’s fine. Sally Thorne is that kind of author for me. I thought it had potential, a lot of it, but it ultimately fell so flat. That disappointment made me the most upset. I gave it 2.5 stars for the “fine” easiness of it, but I didn’t round up because I think it could’ve been more than fine but it wasn’t and that’s the boob punch. Full review below. Sorry if I’ve wrecked your dreams of this one. Personally, I didn’t like it but I’ve been told I’m petty. This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat. ✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different. My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g. Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene. Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a. The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs. I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much. This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.  She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t). I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.* She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad! (You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel. Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done. I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one. ✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope. Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, but I don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising. There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy. Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically all hinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina. Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family. That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case. The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t. *Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy!

OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD THIS IS MY FAVORITE ROMANCE BOOK EVER NOW EMILY HENRY I'D ACTUALLY DIE FOR YOU I'M SERIOUSi finally read book lovers. and i literally want to DIEthis is about to be a ramble, so just bear with me.here is a nice little dilemma: there’s a bright side and a not so bright side of emily henry’s books. on the bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.on the not so bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.do you see that double edged sword?book lovers is my perfect romance. it will never, ever get better for me than this. i know this is such a bold statement, but let me explain why: book lovers had everything i want in a book, let alone a romance. it made me feel seen through nora. the workaholic city girl who’s seen as cold and withdrawn (nora’s ex’s you never even cry in the prologue was a personal attack). the neurotic control freak who’s terrified of even giving a tiny bit of that up. the older sister who would do anything for her younger sister. i don’t think the way i 100% related to nora will ever be replicated in any other book (this book and conversation with friends will always be it for me).this book is actually on my top 5 books EVER. my top 5 (in no particular order) now goes: the secret history, conversation with friends, persuasion, anna karenina, and…BOOK LOVERS.if you’ve been following me…you know how monumental this is for picky romance bitch elle. this makes up for every single horrendous romance book i read last year that i one starred.holy shit. this book is PERFECT. the characters, the chemistry, the emotions, the banter, the romance?? i actually cannot stress how perfect this is.i am picky and i am a cynic. i have been so consistently disappointed by anything romantic in my life. but this book made me actually realistically hopeful for the fist time. because while romance was the main plot, nora and charlie’s respective problems did not get overshadowed. the heavy topics mentioned were nuanced and fleshed out and handled with such a great amount of depth.nora is me. i can’t describe her another way. i have never read a character who so closely resembles my personality (frances from conversation with friends resembles the way i think + my self reflections, but nora’s personality is just completely me). emily henry crawled inside my brain and took my thoughts and my experiences. wow.reading this made me stupidly optimistic that maybe i can too find a very hot and swoon-worthy guy who can deal with me in all my control freak, neurotic, workaholic, bitchy city girl glory. one can dream.see? this is what good romance books do to me. it makes me actually have…(gags) hope.charlie is the perfect combination of sweet and sarcastic and aloof and brooding. also, at one point, he lines up all of his utensils in a row which was just SO hot to me? and the way he’s so blunt and straightforward and honest and heartfelt without being an asshole or cringey. he’s loyal and understanding and never makes nora sacrifice anything, which is something we really don’t see in romance books. god. what a perfect, perfect man.not only that, but this book has THE best banter and chemistry i have ever seen. and i don’t mean that lightly. and charlie. i promised i’d elaborate on charlie in my pre-review, so here is me trying to sum up just how much i love him.and this book. this book is also a love letter to all eldest siblings. the way nora loves her sister and the responsibilities charlie had. anyone who is the eldest sibling or an older sibling will 100% understand. emily henry is always able to write family with such heart and depth, and this is no different.i will never shut up about this book. i’m about to become SO insufferable for the next month.i can’t get over how perfect this book was. i’m going to reread it again tomorrow.","welcome to my main character era.i love emily henry.https://emmareadstoomuch.substack.com...i’ve loved her since the first incarnation of my reading accounts, when i discovered a million junes based on an act of love from the universe, probably, and never looked back.i loved her fascinating, unique, sometimes creepy always lovely magical realism filled with banter and growth and stunning images.when she moved to romance, her books felt less like My Books, ones written specifically for me, but it was kind of wonderful to see them be The Book for so many other people.and then this one came along.and i hate to center myself again, but…just kidding. this is the same person who genuinely said yesterday that the rain was holding out for her walk home exclusively. i have no problem with indulging in narcissism, so:this one feels pretty made for me.i love sisters, and here our almost-as-important close-second relationship after the romance is between two crazy close sisters.i love nora, our cold and tough and mean but on the inside very kind and lovely and of course book-obsessed protagonist. (it will come as no surprise that i relate to her. or, well, relate on the first and third points.)i love charlie, who passes my single requirement for romance novel love interests with flying colors. (this single requirement is, of course, being obsessed beyond logic with our main character.)i love banter. it is the best part of any romcom and it isn’t close. this has plenty.i love having-it-all happy ever afters. i love when the magic perfect ending doesn’t just include love, but like 9 other neatly tied up subplots ending with confetti and rose petals or whatever too.i love being a tall girl, and i love that this book recognizes our struggle!!!i love dream jobs. i love tropes. i love mean-girl characters. i love little kids. i love books!!!when it came to this book, it feels like — beyond my missing magical realism, and the not-very-enemies beginning of this enemies to lovers, and some excessive sister sneakiness — i loved (almost) it all.bottom line: emily henry forever!!!4.5------------------reread updatethere's no problem that can't be solved by rereading every emily henry book---------------pre-reviewplease respect my privacy at this time (deciding whether to give my third romance five star ever).review to come / it's either 4.5 or 5---------------currently-reading updatesthis is the best day of my life---------------tbr reviewanyone have any tips on hibernation?"
The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,4.13,"EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.You will cry, because this is VERY sad.So a discussion occurred in my head after I rated the book. A voice in my head: Come on. You can't post that on Goodreads. Me: *glares* Why not? A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. Me: *weary* Not that again. VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS.Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me.VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's John Green. Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. Me: *stares*VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA!Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads!Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't.VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! Me: I didn't. I mean, I liked it, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues.VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples.Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! “My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”
VH: So? It's beautiful.Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your thoughts to stars? REALLY?VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite.""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.""
VH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry?Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?“They don’t kill you unless you light them,” he said. “And I’ve never lit one. It’s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing.”
Me: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor!Me: I know!“It’s a metaphor,” I said, dubious. “It’s a metaphor,” he said.“You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...” I said.“Oh, yes.” He smiled. “I’m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.”
Me: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a METAPHOR!VH: What's your point, you freak?Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how awesome they are. VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.Me: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. reading lady. Because she has such a sweet voice and everything. Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* wish fulfillment hello.VH: I am so not convinced.Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They can't exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford. So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of Before I Die. And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished A Monster Calls because I was crying so hard. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried like a bitch every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you used to be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that used to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, ""I'm gonna make them cry."" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: ""ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.""VH: But--Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:“I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”
Me: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME.VH: ...Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser and his even more loser sidekick loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book.VH: *suspiciously silent*Me: Are we done?VH: FINE. Ugh. Okay. *Waves white flag* I surrender.Me: Yes! *clicks ""save review""*","Update (25/06/2014)-
Since I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I’m going to clarify few things.-Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review.-Stop harassing me. Why can't you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions, they’re going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it. This world is full of people with differing opinions, differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes, learn to respect them even if you don’t agree with what they have to say about your favourite books. Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesn't make you a good person and me a bad person, It simply shows that people like different things. Every reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone (or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants). Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readers.Shakespeare and J.K Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Green’s book flawless that it’s not allowed to be criticised? -Stop cyber bullying and trolling me. Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book. Remember, every time you comment any bullshit here, you’re giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity. Also, your hate messages aren't going to put me down. I’m a strong girl and I’m always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water. I don't fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where most of the fans are immature cyber bullies who can’t respect other’s opinions. Also, I've caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review, this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful comments.-Lastly, I’m NOT shaming anyone for loving this book. You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to. I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book; I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book, I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books, I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyone’s going to love them, I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat. Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews? Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviews?Alright, now let's begin with the review.
**WARNING- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**
 EXPECTATION-REALITY-So I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December 2012 after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful, life-changing, thought-provoking and blah blah it is. Surprisingly, this book was so special that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it. It didn’t only disappoint me but also angered me. I'm surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece. Ugh! I’m going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of Worst books ever.
The characters-
 Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cut-outs I have ever seen in any book. Both of them were like 60-years-old stuck in some teenager's bodies making them very boring and unlikable. Hazel was such an annoying, stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face. One great example of her stupidity-”Why are breakfast foods breakfast foods...Like, why don’t we have curry for breakfast?”""A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault.But a hot boy . . . well."" Augustus and Hazel have the same boring, pretentious, know-it-all and indistinguishable personality. Hazel is the female version of Augustus (no, I’m not going to call him affectionately with Gus) and he is the male version of Hazel. These two characters meld together and have no depth at all. I couldn’t connect with them, I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them. 
Romance-
 It fell from the sky. Seriously, I don’t get what’s so “beautiful” about the relationship between them. They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other 
~love at first sight~
. The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere. I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustus's house just minutes after meeting him. WHAT THE HELL? How stupid can you be? You fall for a guy's words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house! What if he were a murderer or rapist? Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Frank's house was so effing disgusting. Anne Frank's house is considered to be a place of remembrance, a place where 2 families hid during the dark days of Holocaust. If anyone makes out at such a revered site, they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are. People present around will be disgusted, they won't stand and watch much less clap for the ""lovely"" couple.
Writing-
 Cheesy. Emotionless. Terrible. Want to hear some favourite quotes of mine? “My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”...Why compare your thoughts to stars and constellations? *sighs*""Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."" ""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.""...Yeah, that’s the thing about chocolate, it demands to be eaten. ”I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.” 


 “There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever.”Me-There were senseless dialogues, brain-cell burning metaphors and words thrown around in the book from the dictionary. I’ll stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine. And you know what? Teenagers living in the 21st century DON'T speak like that. No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds. Also, genuinely sick teenagers don’t have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time. One thing I don't buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise. They become terrified, confused, depressed and angry. They DON’T magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life. This book made me roll my eyes in disgust. 
(UPDATE- In response to gazillion questions and arguments I've been getting on the paragraphs above, I have written a detailed explanation below)***

Plot-
 Predictable. Boring. Uninspiring. Put me to sleep. I had to plough through the whole book. Cancer is hard, it's painful but this book didn’t show me that. I couldn’t feel Hazel and Augustus’ struggle against it. I couldn’t feel their pain. TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novel.Me throughout the book-""He died eight days after his prefuneral""WHAT THE HELL?? Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEK!!!Ok, so this book made you cry, right? If a book makes you cry it doesn’t mean that it’s a masterpiece. I can understand that you must’ve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and must’ve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesn’t make it an awesome, life-changing and beautiful story. I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion, it was one of the worst books I ever read. Before you start calling me a cold-hearted bitch for hating and criticising this book, let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not.*** I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or can't have a large vocabulary, don't accuse me of something I haven't said. I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think it's appropriate to use them in their conversations-""I’m awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard” “That kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production”. (wtf?!)It's hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single time.I am a teen and I go to high school, I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills. That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age. They write amazing poems and honestly, it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect. They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously say""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations"".Btw, none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry (the only book Hazel claims to read is An Imperial Affliction) then what's the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues? They aren't geniuses, they aren't teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory, existentialist philosophy and poetry. Therefore, it's not plausible for them to speak with profound words. I would believe their monologues had they shown interest in Kant, Sartre, Nietzsche and Heidegger.Now going over the cigarette metaphor, Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus, giving us another stupid dialogue ""It's a metaphor. You keep the killing thing between your teeth but don't give it the power to kill you"". Funny that he won't kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus, promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others. (What a genius!) Not to mention that he mocks Hazel's cancer right on her face and guess her reaction? She's impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphor.There's a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter. I don't buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible. There's no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK. I've read Green's post on Augustus' character being pretentious and imo, he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious; they are extremely unrealistic as well. Augustus' pretension is not ""an intentional flaw"", it's simply poor characterisation.I'm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent. A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too. I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge. I couldn't sympathise with the characters and feel their pain. That doesn't mean that I'm cold hearted. It's not my fault that I couldn't get emotionally connected to the characters, it's the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with. It's the author's fault for making shallow, judgemental and annoying characters. It's the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust. It's the author's fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book. I'm NOT hating people who have cancer, I'm NOT hating the characters because they have cancer. I'm hating them for who they are. I'm hating the book because it's poorly written. I don't need to have cancer to analyse this book. Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book. Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book. /end rant","I HATE this book. Absolutely hate it. Not just from the bottom of my heart (which would literally mean my ventricles, and so, no) but with my whole heart. I hate it, hate it, hate it.I hate the fact that it made me laugh, so hard! I hate the fact that it made me smile, so much!I hate the fact that it made me chuckle, so profusely!I hate the fact that it gifted me with so much Laughter, Smiles and Chuckles when I was expecting to come face to face with tragedy at any moment....it changed my expectations, made me believe in Something which did not happen...or maybe did happen.I hate the fact that while Hazel Grace 
fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once
, I just 
fell
...no warning, no time to process the myriad emotions coursing through me, nope, nothing, just a huge endless void-filled fall and then a sudden crash that took my breath away, like literally...I hate the fact that I fell in love with this bound-to-end-in-oblivion, bound-to-end-in-disaster boy who stared with blue blue eyes and put the killing thing right between his teeth, but never gave it the power to do its killing. (Putting a cigarette right between your teeth and never lighting it, yes, that's Augustus Waters for you, people, a guy huge on metaphors and symbolism...that hopeless boy).I hate the fact that when I least expected it, the story, the words just grabbed me and pulled me in so deep that even the thought of ever resurfacing never entered my mind.I hate that the fact that right in the middle of my dance in the rain of laughter, dry wit, and humour without any warning, without any lightning as it's precedent, this thunder would stun me, startle me, wipe the smile right off my face, and sober me up, wake me up from the intoxication of the very real yet false jocularity spun by them, a humour which was nothing but human tragedy waiting-to-happen-and-had-already-happened in disguise and then push me back into that rain to dance again.I hate the fact that I'm not making my much sense right now....that right now 
my thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations...
And yes, all the hate above is a metaphor, a symbolic word for love... weird, right? But right now I can't bring myself to say that I love this book....I don't, I don't, I don't (yes, I do, I do, I do...)So, *deep breath*, it's a story of a girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster, a girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 13 who's still alive at 16 thanks to a miracle drug which didn't work it's miracle in about 70% of the people but it did work in her. So, even though her lungs suck at being lungs, she's still alive and well not kicking, but breathing, with difficulty (because remember her lungs suck at being lungs), but breathing nonetheless. She's been nothing but a terminal case ever since her diagnosis. The doctors are simply finding ways of keeping her alive rather than removing the cancer ridden lungs and replacing it with a new one, because let's face it, her chances of surviving such an operation are like next to nothing and why waste a good pair of lungs on a given, bound-to-fail body? So, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis.Enter Augustus Waters. He's 17, gorgeous, in remission, and very frankly and much to her surprise interested in her. It's a match made in Cancer Kid Support Group, in the Literal Heart of Jesus (you'll know what that means when you read the book...you'll laugh, trust me, you will). He is a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. He's the unexpected, hot, gorgeous twist in her story...a story which is about to be completely rewritten...Their story begins with a staring contest...he stares at her...So she stares back...because let's face it...(Spoiler Alert: She wins.)And it progresses into something brilliant, something as bright as the stars, into Something with a capital S....I hate this book. (This needs indefinite repetitions, I hate it).I hate the fact that I fell in love with their always. 
""Okay""
I hate the fact that Hazel Grace took the words right out of my mouth when she said what she said about being a vegetarian...
""I want to minimise the number of deaths I am responsible for,""
 and about not knowing what's cool...
""I take a lot of pride in not knowing what's cool.""
I hate the fact that I fell in love with this blue-eyed boy who drove horrifically and his cheesy and yet very endearing attempts to be Prince Charming....(but more so with him...the surprised, excited and innocent side of him..)

""May I see you again?"" he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.I smiled. ""Sure.""""Tomorrow?"" he asked.""Patience, grasshopper,"" I counseled. ""You don't want to seem overeager.""""Right, that's why I said tomorrow,"" he said. ""I want to see you again tonight. But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.""

I hate the fact that Hazel Grace felt like a grenade and all she wanted to do was minimise the casualities when (not if but when) she blew up...I hate the fact that I felt sorry for a lonely swing set...a Desperately Lonely Swing Set Which Needed a Loving Home...or maybe it was simply a Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Which Sought the Butts of Children...and the fact that I absolutely love this sentence....The Lonely Swing Set... or maybe Just Vaguely Pedophilic...And even though I fell in love the way you fall from a cliff or a building, (don't really know how that feels..since I've never done that)..I hate the way she fell in love...I hate this kiss....because for who so firm that cannot be seduced?

And then we were kissing. My hand let go of the oxygen cart and I reached up for his neck, and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes. As his parted lips met mine, I started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way. The space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment I really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing I'd spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle, worth the chest tubes and the PICC lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors.

I hate the love letter she wrote him...(Spoiler Alert: It's a Venn diagram love letter.)I hate the fact that she did not agree with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (in which Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, claimed that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs.) Something like this...Unless and until your needs of the previous level have been fulfilled, you don't even think about the needs of the next level. Of course, like all psychological theories this one too cannot be generalized or accepted universally. Because if there is one law in psychology then it is that there is no law in psychology, there is no given universal laws for human behaviour or thoughts or anything. Every theory has it's use and flaws, applicable to some while not applicable to others. And this one is not applicable in this situation. Nope, not at all. I hate the words, the word play in this book...
a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies....triumphantly digitized contemporaneity....
I hate the fact that it made me laugh so much, smile a lot, fall in love so hard only to exact revenge later on for giving in to the false security of humour and love by making me cry....oh god, cry so much....so much...
Because that's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.
I get it...totally get it...I hate the fact that I ever read this sentence...
""I lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel Grace...""
. I hate it, I really hate it (forget metaphorical resonances, forget symbolism, I actually hate it).I hate the fact that it made me cry so much that the lovers of-god-knows-which-century entwined on my pillowcase were drenched in the torrent of my tears and were probably ruing the fact that there was no umbrella during their time.I hate the fact that I stayed up whole night reading this book, half of the night crying, and even after finishing it I couldn't go to sleep, so the rest of the dawn just pacing in my room with all these haphazard, desultory stars jumping around in my mind finding absolutely no avenue to become constellations.....and my eyes puffy (Note to self: Do not stay up all night or add crying to it if you do to avoid puffy eyes.)Why do I do this to myself??And I absolutely hate this...I hate that this story is stunningly overwhelming, insightful, irreverent, raw and devastating...and to quote Markus Zusak, it's the kind of story reading which ""You laugh, you cry and then you come back for more.""
Some infinities are bigger than other infinities...
...I'm grateful for having known this little infinity...grateful for this epic love story of two star crossed lovers....[image error]I like my choices. I hope you like yours.And by hate you know I meant love, right?I love this book. Right now, my thoughts are too jumbled up..."
The Hating Game,Sally  Thorne,3.87,"This is another one of those books I've owned since it (almost) came out but I never got around reading it. Funny story: I almost bought another copy of this because I thought I lost my copy of it. I'm embarrassed to admit that I almost cried. Books are expensive. I'm so glad I found my copy and didn't buy a new one though, or I would have been crying but they wouldn't be happy tears. The elevator scene. I don't get it. When you say two characters truly hate each other, I expect hate, but this wasn't it. It was nineteen percent in and they were already throwing lustful eyes at each other.I will be honest though and say that even if a romance has that, there is still potential for the story to pick up and be enjoyable. But, in this case, it wasn't. There wasn't one moment where I enjoyed reading this. I was bored the entire time. It's a wonder I finished it.This is just one of the worst romance novels I've read. Office rom-com my ass. I found nothing funny about this. Where was the comedy? There are also hardly office scenes besides the two staring at each other the entire time. There is really no humor in this whatsoever. Josh and Lucy's banter was not in any way funny. I don't get it man.I'm not going to write a full review for this but I'll mention some things I quicky wrote on my notes as I was reading:3% in: Apparently Josh’s blue Post-its make his desk the male version of hers. Also because he has mints instead of lipstick, whatever that means.14% in: Lucy has her first wet dream with and of Josh. She then spends every waking moment thinking of him, his muscles, his body against hers, and, well, you get the point.19% in: Josh kisses Lucy in the elevator even though he didn’t ask her because he’s been trying to prove a theory he’s had for a while. Before he kissed her, she put her arms in defense and thought he was going to kill her. After kissing her, she's clearly weak, meaning she enjoyed it, of course. When she asked him why he kissed her, he just said “I had to prove a theory” and ignores her wonder because he really didn’t answer her question. 24% in: The office gang has a paintball match. Danny, a designer who used to work with Josh and Lucy, is clearly interested in Lucy, and in that moment, she is as well. Danny tries getting close to Lucy but Josh snaps at Danny when he talks to her. He also shot him with his paintball gun when Danny waved to Lucy. Like, seriously?? You’re that jealous???32% in: Josh takes care of Lucy. He lowkey shows signs of jealousy when Lucy calls his brother cute (keep in mind that his brother, Patrick, is getting married. I don’t know what Josh’s deal is).47% in: “But . . .” My voice is plaintive. “I thought . . .” His eyebrows pinch together in a fake display of incomprehension. “You know . . .” “It’s rather hurtful to only be wanted for my body. I didn’t even get the date beforehand.” He looks down at our hands again.This scene just made me laugh. Here’s how this went: Lucy tells Josh she wants to be friends with him, or something.Josh asks Lucy what she means by “something.”Lucy says to be friends or to be people that don’t hate each other.Josh asks Lucy if Danny is her boyfriend, which she answers to no but not directly. The two have a moment where they’re all lovey again. Lucy then tells Josh she’s gonna try and play the “Or Something Game” with him.The two then get sexually tensed.Josh then tells Lucy he wants her to have her date with Danny and kiss him and that he wants to know if it was good. He says the Or Something Game cannot proceed until she tells him. He then says if the kiss isn’t as good as his (Josh), she can’t kiss him (Danny) again. Did I mention they were in a janitors room? Well they are so after this Josh pushes Lucy out. Lucy makes an excuse for him after his boss looks for him. Josh returns 20 minutes later. Moving on. Lucy then tells her that if the Or Something Game involves sex, it will be a one time deal. Once. The two agree. He then writers his address on a blue sticky Post-it note and hands it to her.And now, Josh, you’re telling me you didn’t get a proper date when you could have denied the sex and maybe, I don’t know, asked for a date instead, Or Something???????? Did I miss something?? Lucy's date with Danny clearly didn't go well. Danny kissed her, but she didn't like it, so Josh won. She's now at his apartment, telling him this, admitting it, yada yada. As Lucy is about to leave, this is their conversation:“You’re not going to miss me, are you? You can manage one little Tuesday on your own.” He touches the little toy car in my hand and spins the wheels a little. I try to be nonchalant, but he probably sees through it. “Miss you? I’ll miss looking at your pretty face, but that’s about it.” The relationship was just pathetically sad for me at this point. 51% in: It’s the next day. Lucy sends Josh a note saying “I want you for more than your body.” Josh replies with “Glad to hear it.” Lucy then calls Josh and tells him she’s bored (implying she wants to come over), and he says “Better come over then.” And you know, personally, I don’t like sweat. It’s quite . . . gross. It’s normal, of course, but gross. Josh was working out, so Lucy says “I want to see you all sweaty.” She gets to his apartment and sees him, then she runs up to him and smells him, describing his sweat as “[rainwater and cedar], leaving a faint rosemary-pine tingle in my nostrils.”What it is about books and their sniffing??? Yeah I was really over it.93% in: “What are the marks in your planner?” It pops into my head. He didn’t answer last time; I doubt he will now. He smiles and looks at his plate. “It’s a bit juvenile.” “I’d expect nothing less of you.” “I record whether you’re wearing a dress or skirt. D, or S. I make a mark when we argue, and I make a mark when I see you smile at someone else. Also, when I wish I could kiss you. The dots are just my lunch break.”I get the lunch break dots, but, marking when she smiles at someone? It was probably when she smiled at other guys, considering everything else that’s happened and been said. I mean, he even kept the Post-it note she kissed and plastered it on his refrigerator . . . And also, making a mark for when she wore a dress or skirt? He's quite the observer, if you ask me.95% in: “What’s my favorite color?” “Easy. Blue.” “What kind of blue?” “Bedroom blue!” I point at the wall. “The walls. Your shirt. My dress. Pale Tiffany blue.” He tugs me to sit, then goes to the end of the bed. He opens his wardrobe door, and I see all of the shirts hanging in color sequence.“Josh, you dork.” I start to laugh and point, but he grabs my ankles and drags me to the end of the bed. There’s a full-length mirror, and I see myself, at long last sitting on the bed in his robin’s-egg bedroom. His walls are the blue of my eyes. I’ve been a bit slow.Ah yes, the moment Lucy finds out his walls are the color of Lucy’s eyes and loves it. Just, lovely.98% in: “I’ve been trying to drag you down with me. In the worst, most ill-conceived and socially retarded way possible.” We love the r-word being used in the context of Josh telling Lucy he’s loved her since the moment he saw her. So romantic.","Warning: This review will have lots of quotes and (?) maybe spoilers, I guess. The Hating Game gets all the praise in the world. I wanted to see what's up, why is this book so popular, why does everyone love it so much. I found out it had a hate/love relationship plus an enemies to lovers trope as well. I loved those ones so so much. But The Hating Game became The Problematic Game.First of all: Since the very first start, our main protagonist, Lucy, comes off as very fatphobic. And she is, you find out after you keep reading. She constantly calls their boss, Mr. Bexley, ""Fat Little Dick"". What I got from this is that she thinks ""fat"" is insulting and she calls him that. And even if he was fat, she uses it in a way that she thinks she is doing him harm. I'm gonna tell you something: The word ""fat"" is not something bad. Being fat is not something bad. I don't know why Lucy is using it that way, and it only tells me that she is fatphobic. Because example #2: Lucy wishes, at one point, that Joshua wasn't perfect as she always calls him. She wishes ""he would be a short, fat troll."" And again we see she uses ""fat"" to insult.Page 15. Lucy is describing hers and Joshua's desk. She says her desk has pink Post-Its. And then she begins to describe Joshua's and she says he has blue Post-Its and that his desk is the very male version of hers. This keeps coming back in the book, every time Lucy tries to assign gender to random things? Stuff like ""this desk is very manly, leather is very masculine and manly, this is very male, your bedroom is so feminine."" I was tired to keep reading this. First of all: things have no gender, even less COLORS HAVE NO GENDER COME ON. If you like pink that doesn't mean anything and if you like blue that doesn't mean ANYTHING AT ALL EITHER. Gosh. People need to stop thinking like that, it's just hurtful and not at all good. ""The dark brown headboard, plushly upholstered in leather, saves the room from femininity.""I just don't even know what this means, why was this written, why do you want to keep saying this in your novel. Page 27. This next thing is the worst thing for me about the whole book because it has no excuse. Lucy uses the g* slur. No one should ever use the g* slur. And Lucy is white, privilege and I bet 1000% she doesn't even know what the meaning around it. She just uses it as an adjetive, of course, it is always used like that. Here is the complete quote:Monday to Friday, he turns me into a scary-looking woman. I look like a g* fortune-teller screaming about your imminent death. A crazed lunatic in an asylum, seconds from clawing her own eyes out.Also if you noticed, Lucy is ableist as well. She constantly uses the words ""psycho"" ""mental"" ""crazy"", etc. And in this passage she compares ""scary-looking woman"" with the fortune teller, so that clearly depicts how Lucy sees them. And then she uses ableist terms. What's new about these white romance novels tbh. I truly expected something else when I started this book, not all of these problematic quotes and words. I did expect it to be this white because there is not one POC in this book which it's weird because the worls IS NOT WHITE, PEOPLE. THE WORLD IS DIVERSE, IT HAS PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES. But white people like to think they are the only ones in the world to be honest. So in Lucy's work place there are only white people. They even describe the white skin of one of the coworkers like he has ""silver-blond skin."" That's such a weird term and it just shows me the heights people want to go to describe white people. Ok. Page 66. Lucy says this: ""The investigators will see my fishnets and heavy eye makeup and assume I'm a hooker."" First, she thinks the investigators will ""assume"" she is a stripper because of things she's wearing. LUCY, PEOPLE WEAR FISHNETS AND HEAVY EYESHADOWS FOR THEIR DAILY LIFE SOMETIMES. That doesn't mean anything. Plus she says it in a way that also disrespects sex workers, like it's bad they will assume she is a hooker??? What's wrong with being a hooker? Gosh. Something that keeps bothering me but that's just me. I get it. I GET THAT JOSHUA TEMPLESOMETHING HAS BLUE EYES. You don't have to repeat it to me, Lucy, every single sentence. ""He has blue eyes but now they're navy because he's angry and now they're serial killer black because he's horny and now they're Tiffany blue and bluer than the Atlantic ocean wow"" Stop. I hate it. AND/// Lucy also has blue eyes???? Come on. And in another passage Josh says his ex-gf has brown eyes and that she's boring. Thanks a lot. Joshua Templesomething is a very abusive hero. He is also very controlling to the point to click CALL END to a phone call Lucy is having with Danny, this other guy. HE LITERALLY TOOK LUCY'S PHONE FROM HER AND ENDED THE CALL. !!!!! Signs should be up and red lights should be turning on. This is seriously so wrong. He gets 1000% jealous and angry when Lucy talks to other guys and it's just so gross. He calls himself a ""jealous psycho"" yikes Joshua, why. I expected Joshua to be this cool ice king type of character but I got this?? I got a guy who definitely uses his big body to an advantage towards Lucy's small body. He's always ""caging"" in and you can see that he definitely overpowers her. More bizarre quotes: ""His sweat smells like rainwater and cedar, leaving a faint rosemary-pine tingle in my nostrils."" Wow I didn't know sweat smelled like rainwater and apples and rainbows and flowers and Lucy is always smelling Josh 24/7. This reminded to SJM books *cough* you all know how she loves to say how male someone is or how male this situations is lmao and include scents to every single male character that appears in those books. So I believe The Hating Game has that kind of writing in mind. ""I think about what kind of girls he probably dates. Tall, cool blondes. I feel it in my tiny undersized brunette bones."" This just screams the ""I'm not like other girls he has dated"" trope which I hate. And very girl vs girl personality she has. She doesn't hate women, Lucy I mean, but she is always thinking like the girls Joshua would have dated or dated before her and they were always ""blonde and tall and beautiful and nothing like her."" This bothers me so much. So what the hell does it matter if they were blonde? Being blonde doesn't mean anything and you are just stereotyping people, Lucy. Come on, be better. So tell me, why is this book so popular? When there are better books with this same kind of trope and relationship without the abusive hero and racist phrases and -phobic and ableist remarks. I can't believe this book is popular ~ I guess I can if you all love CH books lmao you would love this but ??? It has some serious issues and problems and problematic things that even if you loved it you definitely should talk about them because it's not good to just put them under the rug, to forget them just because you loved a character or a relationship. If this keeps happening, publishers and authors will see this sells and abusive heroes sell and heroine being fatphobic sell and IT'S NOT OKAY.","5 Stars!! I honestly think 'The Hating Game”' is that kind of book anyone would enjoy – wonderfully written is a very entertaining way, griping from the very beginning and perfect if you love enemies to lovers stories. I’ve read many books with this trope, so trust me when I say Sally Thorne’s debut novel was a great one. More than great actually. It was fabulous! It was fan, entertaining and so refreshing. Needless to say, I devoured this little gem from start to finish. 

“I'm twenty-eight years old and it seems I've fallen through the cracks of heaven and hell and into purgatory. A kindergarten classroom.""

Lucy Hutton met Josh Templeman when Gamin Publishing and Bexley Books merged to avoid financial ruin. They are the executive assistants to the two owners of “Bexley & Gamin” publishing house and they have been hating each other from the moment they met. Well...almost! Lucy and Josh are opposites in every way. While Lucy is sweet, fun and quirky, Josh is grumpy and cynical. From the very beginning, Lucy and Josh have been playing different games – games like ‘The Staring Game’, 'The Mirror Game’, ‘The HR Game’ and of course ‘The Hating Game’ - trying to frustrate and intimidate each other. 

“I should mention that the ultimate aim of all our games is to make the other smile, or cry. It’s something like that. I’ll know when I win.”

Everything seems to get worse between Lucy and Josh when they find out one of them will be the other boss. But the dynamic between them changes again with an earth shattering kiss. This was such an awesome read! I’m not exaggerating when I’m saying this was one of the most entertaining enemies to lovers story I’ve read so far. Lucy and Josh’s story was fun, sweet and so well done. Told entirely from Lucy’s POV, “The Hating Game” has one of the best slow burn relationship I’ve read in a while. I loved how the relationship between these two unfolded. The transition from enemies to lovers was perfection IMO, gradual, believable and gave me tons of butterflies. 

“Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day.”

Lucy was an awesome narrator and a fantastic, endearing heroine. I loved her portrayal. She was sweet, kind, considerate and so much fun. She was a genuinely good person, a refreshing, relatable character I’m sure many readers will love from the very beginning. I think what I loved the most about her was the way she pushed Josh’s buttons. *grin* Pure entertainment! As for our male main character…Josh was so much more than I’ve initially thought he will be. He was arrogant and a little cruel, but not too much to be annoying and like Lucy he loved their “silly” games. Btw, I totally loved their games myself. 

“…if I were your boss, I’d work you so fucking hard. So fucking hard.” 

They were fun and enchanting and I couldn’t read fast enough to find out who will win a certain game or how their relationship will unfold. I loved Josh’s humor, his shirts...lol, his sweetness, his vulnerability and of course the fact he was a cuddler. The man was very swoon-worthy most of the time. The witty banter between these two was fantastically done. They made me smile and grin so many times as the story progressed and I really had a great time watching them hate each other less and less and slowly falling in love. The sexual tension between these two at times was…combustible and all the sexy teasing…so good! LOVED IT!!

“All I want to do is kiss you until I fall asleep. I want to slide in between your sheets, and find out what goes on inside your head, and underneath your clothes. I want to make a fool of myself over you.”

I really enjoyed Lucy’ POV, but I have to admit I really missed Josh’s because there were many times when I wanted so badly to be in his head. Also, I wouldn’t have minded an epilogue...just saying! All in all, 'The Hating Game' was a great debut novel. If you are looking for a fun, sweet enemies to lovers story, with two engaging, well developed main characters and delightful dialogue, don’t hesitate and pick this one up!"
Twilight,Stephenie Meyer,3.67,"Okay, I have to say that I picked this book up partly due to all the hype (and partly because it's involved two of my favorite genres)... I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least tried to.Let me first say that I am a huge romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I really wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, very wrong. A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:1. Lack of characterization:Bella- Okay... I absolutely hated this girl. She was the worst female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be that dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is very unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have loved for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very ""plain"" looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I hate Mary Sues.Edward- Okay, this boy is just way too possessive and stalkerish (it is not romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and ""bad boys"" usually don't sit there and say ""I'm dangerous, stay away"" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.2. Writing style:Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. 3. Descriptions:I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is that shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was so much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so ""hot"", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was ""hot"" or not.Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus sparingly (aka: only when it is truly needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.4. Plot:Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something finally happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, ""Look, there's a plot right there."", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole ""romance"" between Bella and Edward is not the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.5. Plot holes The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens never aged! And the ""children"" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that someone would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of that many morons! (Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...) Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so ""human loving"" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to ""fit in"", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not that uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his ""siblings"" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: ""Well it is a fictional vampire book."" That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.6. VampiresLike I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost ""misunderstood"" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they are creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures do not sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that sparkles in the sun. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think ""vampire"" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special ""powers"", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are ""vegetarian"" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: ""Write what you know"". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.7. MessagesI am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. (All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. (Bella goes on and on and on about how hot some part of Edward is every other page)3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are so very important. (Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. (It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is wrong with people these days?!)5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for everything.(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. (Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. (This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.8. The Obsession:Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward ""belongs"" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected much better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a much better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!And, oh just for the record... Twilight is NOT the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually has talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.Though, it does make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should really take a look at this.","Actual rating: 1.5 stars. Believe it or not, there are actually a few books that are worse than Twilight.Ok, funny story. I was sitting on my couch with my husband last night finishing up Twilight. I slammed the book shut and began rubbing my temples. Then, my husband goes, ""So you finally finished, huh?"" ""Yes. I can't believe I used to like this book,"" I said. ""Hahaha! Yeah, I remember you were on Twilight's balls hard."" Yeah, yeah, yeah...There isn't a single book on my shelf that has fluctuated between all ratings besides Twilight. No, your eyes do not deceive you. I actually have read Twilight 4 times. I used to hail from Shelfari.com and the first rating I ever gave Twilight was 5 stars. After I made the switch to GoodReads, I decided to give it 4 stars instead. So, recently I was browsing my GoodReads shelf (I often do that to clean up ratings), I noticed Twilight was sitting pretty at 4 stars and was on my ""favorites"" shelf. At the time I thought, ""Wow, that's not accurate at all. Maybe it deserves 3 stars?"" But I quickly decided, no, no, no...I'll just do a fun little project and re-read the series and give them all better ratings. If your curious about the details of the project, stop on over here: Project: Hindsight. And hey, if you like what you see, won't you subscribe? Yes? /end shameless self promotion. The coolest thing about re-reading Twilight is that it has caused me to create really cool new shelves such as:""Kill me now""

""Idiot heroine""

""This is *not* literature""

And my personal favorite: ""Where's my chocolate?""

One of the first things I noticed during this re-read was how incredibly boring it was. Bella is dull as a doorknob. And the first few chapters of the book are essentially a 'Bitch, Moan, Complain' session. So, we have Bella moving to Forks, WA because she wants her mother to be happy (more on that later). And she's all like, ""Ohhhh, I hate this place. It's green. Ewww, it's wet. Fuck my life."" And what's one of the first things Bella does when she arrives in Forks? She cooks Charlie dinner. 

No, I don't have an issue with a female character enjoying cooking, but it is practically thrown in my face that Charlie can't fend for himself; Bella has to cook. Well, what the hell was he doing before she arrived?! Oh, ya, did anyone else realize that despite the fact that she says she is not allowed to call Charlie by his first name; she almost always calls him Charlie? WTF. Bella goes to school and during lunch she first cast her eyes on the Cullen family. 



 Her next period happens to be Biology (because that's where you'd meet a vampire, right?) and as she walks past the fan Edward goes: 

And she's like, ""WTF. Do I smell?"" Little does she know that Eddie just wants to devourer her little, ivory skinned ass. His reaction is so off-putting that she cries when she gets back to her truck. All because Eddie doesn't like her. Who the hell cares, Bella? Conceded much? Get over yourself. But no, she just obsesses with it. 
""Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Everyday, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens had entered the cafeteria without him.""
 Meanwhile, poor Mike is trying to put the moves on Bella and invites her to a beach trip. Speaking of the beach trip, here is something the editors should have picked up on. When the beach trip is first brought up it's supposed to be happening in two weeks. But, as Bella goes on and on about nothing in particular, a few pages later she mentions 
""...just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks.""
 Wait, what? Anyone notice something? Six weeks have passed and the beach trip is where? Not only that, but the girl's choice dance was also two weeks away and here six weeks have passed...
""I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago.""
 Anyway, moving on. Some random shit happens causing Edward to swoop in and save danger prone Bella. The worst thing about Twilight is how incredibly dependent Bella is on Edward. When she's not with him, she is always thinking about him. And that doesn’t make any sense. She barely knows him. They've had like two or three conversations and she has thoughts like: 
""And what was my other choice--to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him.""""It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now.""""You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.""
 And then, because Edward must always prove to Bella that he loves her more than she loves him, he pulls this line: 
""Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most because if I can do it---if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.""
 Are you kidding me? This is not love. But how could it be, with Edward torn between eating her and making out with her? Edward is a controlling creepy creeper. He had been watching her sleep for weeks before they started talking! Meyer are you condoning stalkish behavior?! 

Not.Fucking.Cool. I once read that Stephenie Meyer had a dream and that is how Twilight was born. She says she actually started writing from chapter 13 (The Meadow) to the ending. Oh, ya, that's where we find out Edward sparkles in the sun!  Then, she went back and wrote the first half. It totally shows. While it's true the entire book is a shit storm in action, the second half is noticeably worse. The first half can easily be summed up as ""Bella's Bitch Fest meets Creep-ward"" and believe me when I say, it's really not as bad as the second half. How is that even possible? I have no idea, but Meyer pulls that shit off flawlessly. And ya know? I have a theory on that. Because Meyer had a dream about Bella and Edward and their 'true love' and she went to work on the second half before the first, there is all this raw emotions, strange pet names, and banter that's supposed to be romantic but fails miserably. I just felt terribly uncomfortable reading it. And to top it all off, it was so bad, like, eye bleeding bad! It made me so angry I actually pulled out a pen and started marking this damn book up. Don't believe me? LMAO, seriously folks, I took notes. Feast your eyes on my personal copy of Toilette Twilight That's French for toilet, stolen from Haleema. But I think the French word works pretty well. Hey, if you say it fast enough it sounds dangerously like Twilight. Just saying..

I've also noticed a trend with Meyer. She doesn't write fight scenes. There was a huge build up for a fight with James and we see nothing of the fight. Bella is informed of what happened after the fact. Good job, Stephenie. You totally ripped off your readers there. So, Carlisle is sitting there fixing up Bella on the ground (and he randomly has Morphine, by the way -_-) and Bella is in the process of passing out. But first, Carlisle has a little conversation about Bella's mom and she somehow finds the will to mention to Alice what she knows about James. Like, really? Go to sleep Bella. You talk too much. I won't bore you with the details of the ending. I'm sure you already know. But I do want to say that Bella's mother is the most selfish character (next to Bella, of course). First she ships her off to Forks so she could be with her new husband. And no, do not tell me Bella chose to do that. Renee is the parent and it's *her* job to make sacrifices. Then, when Bella is in the hospital after the fight with James, she acts like she can't be bothered to stay with Bella. 
Then she sighed and glaced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall.""Do you need to go?""She bit her lip. ""Phil's supposed to call in a little while...I didn't know you were going to wake up...""
 Really?? Really, Renee?! Your daughter almost died and you are seriously acting like this? Un-fucking-believable. Oh, but this shit gets better: 
""I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,"" she announced, proud of herself.
 Huh? Do you want a cookie for that? It's your job! 
""I can stay if you need me.""""No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.""She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay.""I'll be back tonight."" Its sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it.
 And what does she think Edward and Bella are going to do? She has a broken leg, broken ribs, and cracks in her skull. C'mon now!Then Edward takes Bella to prom, he kisses her neck. The fucking end.Would I recommend this? Bahahahahahah! You're shitting me, right? I'm about to go do this to my bookshelf:

But I'll tell you what I recommend. I recommend we all do this to our copies of Toilette. 

Amen.Continue on with the madness with my review of Midnight Sun and New Moon.*****BONUS TIME***** I love bonuses! They are so much fun! Have you seen the Twilight parody by The Hillywood Show? No?!

More reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.","Oh my. This book, to me, is like chocolate: a delicious, sinful, addictive indulgence which you convince yourself has beneficial qualities (zinc, calcium, keeps me quiet at that time of the month...) in order to justify your addiction.By ""beneficial qualities"", I mean that it's reading, and since when is reading bad? :) Let me say quite clearly that I'm a sucker for romance, especially the intense, passionate, tragic kind. I don't read romance novels*, though, because to me they are lacklustre - Meyer's book has the extra edge I need, though, a great way of keeping doom hanging over the main characters' heads: she's human, he's a vampire.Sound corny? Yeah, I know, and the only reason Meyer gets away with it as well as she does is because Twilight doesn't try to be anything it's not, and it has such conviction. Only Meyer could get away with giving her narrator the name Isabella Swan. She says in her little bio at the back that she wanted to write believable characters: an interesting choice, then, to write about vampires, but I believed in them, and without such a willing suspension of disbelief, the story would have been a farce. True, a lot of people haven't been able to suspend their disbelief with this book, but that doesn't affect my reading experience :)Seventeen year old Bella's parents are divorced. She lives with her mum in Phoenix, Arizona, and spends time with her dad Charlie in Forks, Washington State, where it rains almost constantly. She hates Forks, but when her mum remarries a baseball player, Phil, and starts travelling with him, Bella decides to move to Forks.On her first day at school she notices the isolated group of five beautiful, graceful siblings. Rosalie, Alice, Emmet, Edward and Jasper. One in particular catches her eye: Edward Cullen, with his rust-brown hair and topaz eyes. She is more than a little surprised and shocked when he seems to have developed an acute, profound hatred of her. Her fascination deepens, especially when, after a brief disappearance, he saves her life. She soon figures out what Edward is, and the knowledge doesn't frighten her. The shaky friendship between them develops into something much stronger, and Edward reveals his overpowering reaction to her smell that nearly made him kill her on the spot - hence the look on his face that so shocked her, and the restraint he put on himself during an hour of Biology.Let's not forget he's incredibly handsome: even though Bella describes almost every glance he makes and every twitch of his lips, not once did I get bored and roll my eyes. My fascination grew alongside hers, until I too fell in love with Edward - in a totally girly, daydreamy way. Yes, I admit it. I don't know if that makes this a girly kind of book - these days those boundaries don't seem to matter so much, and the vampire family is pretty darn cool, what with Edward's extra ability to read minds, Alice's premonitions, Jasper's ability to affect people's emotions, their speed, their invincibility... Bella is at one point compared to Lois Lane, because Edward and his kin really are like Superman.One of the things I love about YA books: the clarity with which they are written. Granted there is some repetition in Twilight, but to me it's necessary repetition. There's nothing superfluous in Twilight, nothing that shouldn't be there, and the flow, the pacing, is great. It's a fat book, but I read it in two days. I read it with breakfast, on my walk to the subway, on the subway, up the escalator, through the ticket gates, to work, in my lunch break ... you get the picture. I couldn't get enough of it, and it left me with that same craving for more that Harry Potter did (I remember scrounging around for loose change as soon as I finished one of them and dashing off into the city to get my next fix. It helped that four were already out when I started). There's plenty of negative stuff you could say about this book - the writing, the characters, the obsession - but again, I couldn't care less :)Another thing I loved was all the vampire myths Meyer scrapped. These vampires aren't burnt to ash by sunlight: their marble skin glitters as the sunlight is broken into miniscule shards, like diamonds - hence why they are living in Forks, where the sun hardly ever shines. They are not hurt by crucifixes or stakes through the heart. They do not sleep at all, nor do they eat human food. They drive fast cars really really fast. And they can fall in love. Awwww.Seriously though, this was one of most fun, most enjoyable, most romantic books I've read in a long time, and I'm so happy there are two more out with a fourth on the way. They are, somewhat predictably, making Twilight into a movie - still in the early development stage - but it's rather fun to go to the author's website and see her own preferences for actors to play Edward etc. Can't say I'm familiar with most of them, but her top choice (now sadly too old), is indeed a perfect match. Who knows who they'll really cast, but as with the book, the characters have to be right or the whole story will be just silly and sappy._____________________________________*Since reading this the first time back in 2007, I've started reading some romance novels. Yes I've been corrupted. Or rather, I've always loved romance stories but had trouble admitting it. Now, I just don't care :)"
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.40,"5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the 
Outlander
 and 
Ross Poldark
 kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!","”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, so GOOD!! I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told! We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich. I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out. Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that. And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:
Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-P
Evelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.” Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh, WHAT. A. WOMAN!  I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.” ”I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the huge 
BUT
 – I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky. Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron was truly the best thing about this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?” To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.” Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… just 
BECAUSE!
 There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutely 
E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!
 Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I just LOVED them!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs* ”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.” ”I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.” The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.” ”I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.” My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charming Ashley for this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)","➸ 4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen. psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point. ➳ evelyn hugo:

“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”

she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality. ➳ celia st. james: 

“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”

SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭 oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖 ➳ harry cameron:

“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.

the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳ monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book. ꒰ evelyn + celia: ꒱

“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”

i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️‍🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo. ───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc —this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩"
Ugly Love,Colleen Hoover,4.01,"1.75 stars ✩⋆oops this is awkward. i know this is a beloved CoHo book and yes, i loved this back then when i first read it but rereading it now i- don't look at me.my reading taste have changed oookay? i might have overlooked every shitty thing back then but now that i'm more petty, have the penchant for holding a grudge, and have high standards for books ooohh boy. ✧ 
what is this about?
↳ okay so this is about Miles and Rachel oops sorry, i meant Tate and Miles. Miles being Tate's brother's best friend and Tate being Miles' therapist, ugh sorry, i meant friends with benefits person and the whole time she was hoping he would change his mind because duh she's falling for him while Miles just implicitly leads her on even though he's clear about his rules and pushes her away the whole damn time because of his past but he won't stop their little arrangement because our mans is horny as fuck.also, Miles is a pilot. this is an important fact. ALSO also, this is not Tate and Miles' story- this is Tate + Miles and Rachel's story. i read this years ago and the only things i remember is that Miles got horny while he was wearing swim shorts? (idfk why i remember this don't ask), Miles and Rachel's shower scene (again, idfk why i remember this but i wish i can unsee it thank you very much), and then the Nick Bateman trailer??anyways, that's all i remember and i know, they're all irrelevant but do you know what i forgot?? huh? do you? DO YOU??! well, if you've read this then you can probably guess what i didn't remember because HOLY SHIT- the scene at the end. guys... GUYS. What. The. Fuck.i was speechless- S-P-E-E-C-H-L-E-S-S. i canNOT believe i forgot that scene holy shit. the anger. the annoyance- the fucking rage that i felt when i read that oh my god. anyways, i'm ranting again and y'all know the drill so,･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･ 
SPOILERS AHEAD
 ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．⤅ dislike #1: Miles' povyou know what, i'm gonna be straight to the point: MILES SEEMED MORE IN LOVE WITH RACHEL. or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it was that intense. now, now. lemme explain.the problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking ✨ s h a k e s p e a r e ✨ 
She doesn't realize she's everywhere She's in everything Everysingle thing has just become Rachel, It's consuming me.My thoughts aren't thoughts anymore.My thoughts are Rachel.I can't fall in love with you, Rachel.I look at the sink. I want to look at Rachel.I breathe in air. I want to breathe in Rachel.I close my eyes. I only see Rachel.I wash my hands. I want to touch Rachel.
do y'all see this ⤴ ? this is the type of thing i wanted to see from Miles' pov when he's talking about Tate NOT Rachel but we never got to see this until the very end. and then when we get to the present chapters it's 98% in Tate's pov where we see her falling in love with Miles and this is annoying to me because seeing Miles treat Rachel like a goddess in his past chapters and then Miles being a little dickhead in Tate's chapters ugh-energy? not m a t c h e d.and with most of Miles' pov being in the past and falling in love with Rachel, obviously i couldn't help but compare and overanalyze every single thing and think he seems more in love with Rachel. and the thing that annoys me the most is that Tate's present pov and Miles' pov alternates so whenever we read Tate and Miles' romantic progression, the next chapter is Miles being so deeply in love with another woman, it's just...i could've done with just one past Miles pov instead of making it every second chapter or making it 50% of the whole content and showing the way he fell in love sooOOoooOo deeply with Rachel instead of just having 1-2 chapters of his pov about Tate, who's the actual heroine of the book. it's just so bleh and icky the whole time she felt like second best for me and i just felt bad. i know i've always complained about telling >>> showing in other books but this is the only time i'll ever accept all tell, no show.⤅ dislike #2: i can't with the doormat behaviorwhat makes everything more annoying is how Tate just lets him use her for sex and forgives him way too easily all the damn time like bish NO make him work for it for once and stop being a doormat it's annoying (yes, i know i've said the word annoying one too many times but that's how i felt 99.9% of the book OK).
“If any other man ever treated me like he did, it would be the one and only time. I don’t put up with the things I’ve seen a lot of my friends put up with. However, I find myself continuing to make excuses for him, like something could actually justify his actions last week.”
ma'am pLS-the whole time i was just yelling at her, 
TATE, YOU ARE NOT HIS THERAPIST
. ugh this pissed me off so much i couldn't even cheer for their romance because Miles was eh and honestly had no redeeming qualities in the present and then reading about his past pov being all in love with Rachel and in the present he just uses Tate for sex and pushes her away quite rudely all the damn time is, again, A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G.⤅ dislike #3: repetitive romanceno seriously. all they ever did was have sex, Tate hoping he would renege his rules and tell her that he does indeed love her and want a relationship with her, Miles pushing her away, Tate forgives him and then they fuck. repeat.⤅ dislike #4: pain. just- P A I Nand then- AND THEN i was just reading Tate and Miles' repetitive interactions where i thought the same shit would happen again and again in peace but THEEENNN.........hold on, lemme just give y'all a moment to breathe.......are you ready? OK
""My God, Rachel.""
um excuse me- you're probably wondering, mel, did he really say his ex's name, his ex who we've been reading about in his past chapters and won't shut up about how much he loves this other woman, while having sex with Tate?? well, i don't know let's look at the quote again shall we? are you guys ready?
He pulls out, then thrusts inside me again, this time with all his strength. It hurts.Give me your pain, Miles.""MY GOD, RACHEL.""My God, Rachel...Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
there. did y'all see that? okay? good. now, not gonna lie with you guys, this one HURT. when i read this scene i didn't know how to feel to be honest. was i shocked? appalled? speechless as fuck? all of the above?? yes. now with this scene, my annoyance reached its peak and is higher than the fucking stratosphere because why you ask? well, it's because there is NO GROVELING!! Tate leaves, Miles lets her go and says it's hard to feel bad for her because she's never felt real pain, then goes to Rachel for closure, goes to Tate and explains his past vaguely and all is forgiven???i'm pretty sure this is where my hatred for hero fucks up so bad but heroine forgives them after one speech trope came from. now, some might say that he gets a pass because of his sad past- because it really was sad by the way - but you see, for the majority of the book we've been reading about how Miles fought for and loved Rachel, and Tate fought for and loved Miles, for once i wanted to see him fighting for Tate but we never got to see that because again, there is 
NO. GROVELING.
───── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ─────i can't believe i rated this 5 stars back then. i don't know who pre 2019 mel is. we don't know her.honestly, because of the ending, i was this close to rating this 1 star because that's how annoyed i was with everyone but i felt generous today so. as always, i liked the emotional writing and how i can feel the longing and passion between Tate and Miles when they're having sex, the whole ""ugly love"" message, and learning about Miles' past and why he's the way he is?? it was so sad. but overall, everyone annoyed the f outta me (except for Cap- he's the best character in this book), this is basically Miles and Rachel's story, and the ending was unsatisfying as fuck.* * *original rating (july 2015) ── 5 stars","**** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: 6 STARS!!! **** Casting for Miles...  Holy WOW!!! What a beautiful story!!! It was absolute stunning perfection in every way. My heart is just overflowing with emotions ♥Starting with Slammed and Point of Retreat, then with Hopeless, Losing Hope and This Girl, and once again with Maybe Someday, Colleen Hoover has proven over and over again that her stories are unique, powerful and incredibly well written. I have come to trust her writing implicitly. I love the passion she conveys in her words, the depths of the connections she establishes between her characters, and the effortlessly beautiful style in which writes her stories. Without a doubt, she is one of my favorite authors.
Ugly Love
 is beautiful, sexy, and heart-wrenching. It's powerful, compelling and emotionally charged with a unique storyline that was truly unlike any other I've read. For days after  I finished reading, my mind would drift back to Miles and Tate and relive moments of their story because I just couldn't let go.________________ I fell in love with the story on page one. You might think that the first page is a little early to proclaim undying love for a book but I instantly felt connected -- it was like I'd just stepped right into the story.We first meet Tate when she moves in with her brother for a fresh start where her path quite literally crosses with airline pilot Miles Archer as he lies passed out drunk outside her new place. Despite her initial judgment of his character, she quickly learned there a whole side of himself he was hiding from the world -- a deep, bottomless pit of pain and sadness.She wasn't looking for a relationship and he wanted nothing to do with love but they had an undeniably powerful attraction towards each other. Drawn together, but unwilling to give themselves wholly over, they agreed to a friends-with-benefits arrangement following Miles' two, unwavering rules that would forever keep a distance between them.
“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”  
The more time they spent together, the more complicated things became as the lines between friendship and love began to blur. As Tate began to give her heart over, Miles fell further away. The pain of his past was so great that he never again would allow himself to fall in love. Not for any reason, or for anyone.
""It's not that I don't like you, Tate… I just don't 
want
 to like you. I don't want to like 
anyone
. I don't want to 
date
 anyone. I don't want to 
love
 anyone.""
However even through the most painful and ugly times, there's a healing power to love. This story left me emotionally drained but on the most amazing book high you can imagine. It was a powerful journey that showed how even after the worst possible devastation, love can always find a way.________________ Every single moment while reading this book, I was feeling something, and feeling it strongly. It was thrilling, mysterious, sexy, alluring, emotional, it was everything in the exact perfect balance. From the start, it was clear that we were not seeing the full picture so each scene gave us another piece of the puzzle that was Miles' past. Everything just made me want to know more. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!Miles was such an intriguing character to try and figure out. Enigmatic. Mysterious. Smart. Sexy. Sensitive. His past so full of pain that it shut him away from wanting any hope for his future. Not only was he unable to move on, but he genuinely didn't want to.... and he was willing to do everything in his power, to sacrifice anything, to never again have to experience so much pain. Seeing him struggle internally with both his aversion to love and his growing attachment to Tate was just heartbreaking. His pain felt so real that I can honestly say, I've never wanted to hug a fictional character this much before.
""Tate,"" He says in a pained whisper. His face moves to my neck, and one of his hands grips my waist... His other hand moves to the back of my head as his lips rest against the skin of my neck. ""What do I do?"" He whispers. ""What the fuck do I do?""
We were shown the story through both Miles and Tate's POVs in a mix of both present day storylines and flashbacks. The present was told from Tate's perspective and, because of how mysterious Miles was, we got to see flashbacks from his POV six years earlier. And as these little pieces of his past slowly began to line up with his behaviour in the present, I was able to begin putting together the real story he was hiding.He kept so much hidden that all the little things between them -- the hint of a smile, the stroke of a thumb, a quick glance -- became so much more powerful and meaningful. And because of the build up of all these little moments, when Miles and Tate finally got together it was explosive!Dear long-time CoHo fans, be prepared for hotness!!!!!  This is a whole new side to Colleen Hoover's writing and let me tell you, it is sexy and steamy!!! Trust me, you will be fanning yourself ;)
""The couch or your bed?"" he whispers.

""Both,"" I reply.
But on a more serious note.... The more I read, the closer I got to discovering the source of Miles' pain and when it hit, it was gut-wrenching!!! I can honestly say that few character's backstories have ever made my heart shatter as Miles' did. I cried -- no, sobbed -- so much that I could no longer see the words and so I just sat there with tears steaming down my face absorbing the huge emotions this story evoked.
""If I were capable of loving someone… it would be you.""

I want to promise you though that this story is worth every tear because the way all the pieces of the story come together was absolutely gorgeous. The ending will leave you with a joyous feeling but the journey to get there is not an easy one. It's beautiful but so broken. Ugly love.________________ I've read the book twice now and I know I'll be reading it many more times to come. I have the book hangover of the century and I'm finding it hard to let go of Miles and Tate because of how strongly I connected to them. Truly, I don't think there can be greater proof that this was a wonderful book.I've loved every book Colleen Hoover has written but this one is my favorite. Ugly Love is a must-read book of the year! I loved every word, I felt every moment, and I will never forget this story.I don't give out a lot of 6 star ratings (in fact this will be the first one I've given this year) but the truth is that this book went above and beyond. The story was powerful, the writing was stunning, and the way every single piece of it was woven together was simply breathtaking.Rating: 6 STARS!! Standalone romance.And... I still want to hug Miles ♥ Release date: August 5, 2014._____________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦ Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦ Facebook Blog Page✦ Twitter","HOLY CRAP ON A CRACKER!!!!

YOU RUINED ME AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH! IF YOU CAN'T GUESS IT BY MY NON STOP CAPS THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THAN SCREAM ""I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!""WOW JUST WOW! I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHEN I'LL GET OVER THIS BOOK HANGOVER. 

Ugly Love was nothing like I expected it to be. I excepted it too be like a 50 Shades of Grey fan fiction with just a butt ton of thrown together steamy scenes... No, it wasn't it was so much more. I knew I was going to like Miles (because he sounded so hot), but I had no idea that I was going to love him. That he was going to have an actual back story... That he was going to be actually interesting in a realistic way... I had no idea he was going to break my heart.All that being said I have a few bookish confessions to make before I really get into the review, I choose to read this book 1) because I heard it was becoming a movie and if there's anything I love nearly as much as reading it's seeing movies 2) because this is who they have playing Miles:





    
      Yeah I didn't notice the dog at first either...and 3) I also need to admit that I didn't get what was so appealing about this book that it was actually going to become a movie... I get it now. I get all the hype and talk surrounding this book. I have NEVER, EVER, EVER cried so hard in a book. That's the very last thing I thought this book was going to make me do.The characters in this book felt so real. Tate was naive and normally that would make me wanna punch a B, in her case it made me love her. Unlike most leading ladies she isn't overly sassy, or has incredible lol rebuttals,she was realistic. Her brother Corbin, OMG CORBIN, I loved every single thing about him. He has to be one of my favorite sub characters ever. He was what I imagined a brother would be and even with him not being a constant character just his presence had me. Then there's Miles and he is hands-down the star of this book. The moment you meet him you hate him. He is a mysterious mess and I thought he was going to annoy me fast. He won me over once they started going into his back story. The further they went into it the more I could feel what was coming... Yes, I knew where this story was going and what was going to happen but in no way, shape, or form was I actually prepared for it. I was a blubbering weeping ball of emotions.The switch between time and POVs was done flawlessly and revealed the perfect information at the perfect time to keep you hooked and wanting more. Colleen set up this story so at first you would only like Miles because of his looks (which I've already made clear I was guilty of)...""his shirt isn't buttoned. I'm staring at his stomach. Oh my word he has the V. Those beautiful indentations on men that run the length of their outer abdominal muscles, disappearing beneath their jeans as if the indentations are pointing to a secret bull's-eye."" And yes, he is a looker, but by the end I could have cared less about what he looked like. He could have worn a bag over his head for the last half of the book and my heart would have still been his. The relationship between Tate and Miles is like nothing I have read before. It was something else that really surprised me about this book. Saying it was complicated would be an understatement. I thought that the steamy scenes were going to take up most of this book, but it didn't... Yeah that's something that would normally make me rank a book lower, but the scenes were so well written and again realistic. They were well placed and well thought out. Just enough to make this book not ""too much"" which is what had me falling hard for this read way harder than I anticipated. The scenes are hot though like dump a bucket of water on your head hot. Miles and Tate's conversations roll so smoothly and the moments between them are so; I don't even know a word for them, they're just perfect (that word really doesn't do justice). Not only is he romantic but he made average things so hot. Orange juice is hot, rugs are hot, scrubs are hot, and curtains are so so hot. whoosh.Honestly though the scenes that turned out to be my favorite were just ""average scenes"", like when they all go and visit Tate and Corbin's family for Thanksgiving. That whole section had to of been my favorite. I loved how I thought this story was going to be Tate's but turned out to be Miles'. I love how I thought this book was going to be a light sexy read but turned out to be a heartbreaking love story. I just loved how everything came together while falling apart.. Because when all Miles story is finally shown and is laid out in it's fullest I was basically like this...I want to rant and rave even more about this book, but this is something you really need to read and experience for yourself. Ugly Love might just be the biggest surprise read I've had all year. I can't express enough how impressive the characters, plot, and play out of this story are.I didn't think that this book was going to be so hard on me... And yes, it hurt. And yes, it was a total sobbing fest, but that ending... Good golly miss molly.. That ending was perfection. I don't know if I can ever forgive Colleen Hoover for what she did to me, but God dang it I love her so much for it. I didn't see this coming and I've never been so happy to be emotionally slapped in the face like I was reading this."
Twisted Love,Ana Huang,3.72,"2.75 stars ✩⋆when i saw that this book has groveling, best friend's brother, grumpy/sunshine trope, touch her and i'll kill you, i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don't know why but this book just made me evaluate my life- myself. why do you ask? well, 
WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ⤵ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE
:
""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he'll end up in pieces, and you'll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""
and at first i was like because there's things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men: 
1. i hate bossy men (pls- i'm bossy enough as it is)2. toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3. if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4. if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ✋
and normally, my attitude is why do men but when i read this? i don't know myself anymore.i don't know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don't.but anyways, going back to the book, i like both Ava (h) and Alex (H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that's too much perfection ma'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because ✧ Bridget is a literal princess (i'm not joking)✧ Jules is jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book) ✧ Stella is this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother's best friend book the girl is always pining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i'm glad that's not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall, this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are some tw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse -`,✎ 
WHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?
➳ since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the whole Operation Emotion thing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:
""She was mine. She just didn't know it yet. I hadn't known it myself until I saw her in Colton's arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""
i only sensed attraction but i didn't get the feeling they were already at the ""she's mine, he's mine"" stage. one chapter he's acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava's pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance. ➳ telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i'm the type of person who wants to know everything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn't really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wanted all the details of how they are as a couple and we didn't really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it's mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳ Vicious reincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳ OW dramadon't worry, it's nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don't worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava's face:
""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""
and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i'm into, i will dip because that's an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you're telling me you're gonna fuck your girl the same way you've fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎ 
OVERALL THOUGHTS
again, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you're just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma'am i want to see everything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don't see Alex being all soft towards Ava. i'm excited for the next book, aka Bridget's book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name is RHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━ 
Twisted series
 ━━««#1: twisted love — ava x alex ➳ 2.75 stars#2: twisted games — bridget x rhys ➳ tbr#3: twisted hate — jules x josh ➳ tbr#4: twisted lies — stella x christian ➳ tbr","OH BOYYYYYYY! LET'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.   Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don't doubt it. I don't think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable. Can't say the same thing for her characters.   NOTHING in this book or even it's cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attempt every single trope in the history of the universe with a single story, so you can't really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.    You get brother's best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn't date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela. However, I HAVE TO MENTION the best trope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The ""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!"" but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)   Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won't kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family's company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.   IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN. But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.  He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It's like a wish version of Batman. Except Batman is actually cool.   He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY'S license, because it obviously didn't work.  Alex, and I quote:  ""Is not a TOY, so don't play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.  But yeah, Alex's broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that ""biological reactions can be mastered""  Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don't fucking explode    Our female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)  Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.   It's so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don't go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable. She succeeded.   Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.  ""I am turning you into my fuck doll"" (?????????????? I mean if you want her unresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail. I haven't decided yet.)  He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a: ""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""    Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she ""can feel the power it emanates"". I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.   Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex's penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn't tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:  ""my daddy is a lawyer""  in third grade.  It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It's all I needed. It's embarrassing enough on it's own. I hardly did any work here.  Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let's see.  Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.  *wipes sweat off brows*","the red in the flag that is alex volkov is from all my brain cells he has murdered, and the blood of the people he has actually murdered 😍 everybody who said he begged and grovelled for a year LIED, i hope you guys have to wear wet socks for the rest of ur lives 🤠 he spends half a year preparing to stalk ava, and then does that for the next half. no tears were shed on his end, i demand my money back. i wanted to be nice to this book just because of how unintentionally hilarious and satirical it was, but then he

The Deal,Elle Kennedy,4.22,"9/3/2018Updated my review because it was very long and I criticized things that in hindsight aren't as big a deal1.5 stars TW: Rape (mentions throughout + flashback scene), domestic violence/abuseLet me disclaim that there was MASSIVE potential here for a good book, but it had so many problems. I began highlighting lines that said problematic things, and I ended up having 147 notes of things that made me cringe or things that made me uncomfortable. If this book went under rigorous editing it could be the feminist read I think it's trying to be, but there's way too much perpetuation of gender stereotypes/roles, slut shaming, internalized misogyny, and overused/toxic tropes occurring.To set the mood for this review, read this real line in this book:(girl speaking) “You know what I think?”(male love interest speaking) “Women aren’t supposed to think, Wellsy. That’s why your brains are smaller. Science proves it.”Wooowwwww. Even if that’s a joke, fuck off.People reviewed this saying things like “Garrett is sooo different than other guys in NA!” And in one way, I can see it, but he’s not nearly good enough to be considered a ""good"" guy, in my opinion. It begins with him relentlessly asking the main character to tutor him. For chapters. And chapters. She says no to him EVERY TIME and yet he still corners her at parties and after class and is like ‘hey! when are we studying!’ I don't like how disrespectful he was of her space and her time from page one. One of the first times the two main characters see each other, they’re at a party and Hannah is eyeing the guy she has a crush on. Garrett is SUPER creepy because he catches her looking and is like “do you want to fuck him?” Which is 1) a disturbing question and 2) noNE OF YA GODDAMN BUSINESS. and even though it's uncomfy I just shook it off, but then he proceeds to tell her, “You’re not his type.” And she’s really wounded by this, yet he’s grinning and smirking like he’s proud of himself as he makes fun of her for liking him. HE LITERALLY CALLS HER A PUSSY FOR LIKING HIM AND NOT TELLING HIM, AND HE ALSO MAKES FUN OF HER FOR HAVING A CRUSH ON HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.YDFGVSJHBKFLFSYG THAT’S SO SHITTY UGHHHHHWhen Hannah finally agrees to tutor him (after some coercion), he says, “I managed to wear her down.” This is just so degrading. She couldn’t even agree to it willingly—he practically forced her to because he wouldn’t leave her alone about it and she was beginning to see him everywhere and just wanted him to shut up. FURTHERMORE, He coerces her into a relationship because he tells her “hey! if you go out with me, it will make you look like you have a higher status, he’ll notice you, and you can finally be up to his standards so that he’ll date you!” How….. is this normal. How is this supportable. I’m just appalled. This entire book perpetuated the concept of—and Garrett says this himself— “guys only want girls who give them a chase, and they want a woman who’s out of reach because guys want what they can’t have.” gross gross gross gross why can’t we just have 2 people falling in love? EVER? why does it have to be some slimy shit like this???Later on in the book Hannah explains to Garrett why she doesn’t drink (she’s scared of getting drugged due to past sexual assault) and he gets really serious and is like “I want you to drink. I think you should drink. I’d never let anyone hurt you” and she’s kind of pushed into it? During that same scene when she drinks with him for the first time, he stands by passively as she has 3 drinks (gulping down the first one), and then watches and laughs as she’s on stage stumbling through karaoke. He acts like “Oh, I’ll protect you! Don’t be afraid of drinking!” but then doesn’t even promote healthy drinking, or keep her from embarrassing situations. In fact, as she’s on stage singing, all he’s thinking is “I want to kiss her right now” and “im hard as a rock in the middle of this bar.” He later notices how drunk she is and says, I quote, “I love being the one who got her to this point."" at the end of the night they both end up wasted and Garrett, just in his boxers, crawls into bed with Hannah, who's only in a T-shirt. he’s taken five shots and makes a comment that’s like, “even if I wanted to take advantage of her right now I wouldn’t be able to,” referring to his limp dick, but he basically just implied raping her???? byeeee!!! They start making out and in his drunken state he thinks, “I know this is bad but I’m too drunk to care.” Ew.Also, there was slut shaming in this book. The main character constantly refers to the women that have sex with athletes as girls who don’t know any better. Girls who are stupid. She constantly places herself above all the girls that Garrett usually has sex with because she assumes that she’s better and smarter than them for not falling for his tricks. Additionally, there's a lot of pitching women against each other and comparing body types/beauty, so this isn't really the prime feminist literature that it wants to be. It’s just a constant narrative of “i’m better than some girls!!” which sucks. In this vein, Garrett calls the MC a ""total pig compared to other girls i know"" for eating 4 slices of pizza. this scene is punctuated by him saying ""there's nothing attractive about a girl who's skin and bones. i prefer them curvy."" barf gag. bye no thank uThis was cheesy. So bad. It read like fanfiction, or a wattpad smut. Totally cookie-cutter characters with predictable actions. Take a shot every time Hannah rolls her eyes, bites her lip, clenches her thighs, or sighs (you’d be in the hospital by page 5. Seriously. This girl rolls her eyes like twice a page). Completely unoriginal. The dialogue was so cringe-worthy I literally had to put down the book at a few points:“Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?”“Two,” I reply cheerfully.“Do you high five yourself?”“Of course not.” I smirk. “I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.” NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT!!!! NOBODY!!!!! oh my god i’m so heated about this. I’m a college junior, the same age as the characters in this book, and i would r u n if someone started talking to me like this. Automatic no. Soooo I have a preconceived notion of male student athletes. They’re more prone to being rapists. They’re reckless. They eat all the food in the dining hall right before I get there. I’ve never read a great book or interacted enough with male student athletes to prove this wrong, but this book certainly doesn’t help. Every guy is sex-obsessed and calls girls “baby girl” and makes crude jokes. Maybe it’s realistic, maybe it’s not. But this book does nothing to disband my belief that athletes are the worst. So was I excited about Garrett and wanting to date him because he’s ~so nice~ and ~so respectful toward women~? No. And the way that Hannah reacts to all these sexist comments is really off-putting. Everytime, without fail, all she does is roll her eyes and go, “Ugh, boys! What can you do!” For me to take a standing ovation to this, she would have needed to threaten their asses and call them out for their sexist and uncalled for comments. Instead, she just treats it like it’s annoying rather than something harmful and disturbing. I think it’s strange that she’s a rape victim, and yet she finds their comments more annoying than threatening. At one point, one of Garrett’s roommates actually threatens her to tutor him:“I’ll be very, very upset.” His sultry gaze does a slow and deliberate sweep of my body, lingering on my chest before traveling back up. “You don’t want to upset me, do you, gorgeous?”Vomit?????And instead of Garrett being like, “Hey man, that’s shitty, treat her with some respect,” he instead SNORTS and says, “Don’t waste your time, man. She’s immune to flirting. Trust me. I’ve tried.”At one point Garrett is trying to convince her to sing for him (btw, she's a music major lol) and she says, “I know Garrett will harass me all night if I don’t agree.” She even uses the word harassment!!! She knows she’s being mistreated and coerced, and yet she just acquiesces every time. I’m so tired. The problem with this is this whole book promotes the “boys will be boys” attitude. Any time an athlete says something gross, the MC just rolls her eyes. And despite that, she’s like “Garrett protects me from bad things!” and yet Garrett doesn’t do a fucking thing except feel jealous any time that someone makes an uncomfortable advance on her or teases her about something inappropriate or asks her a gross, flirtatious question. This all needed to have been challenged in the book, but it isn’t. It’s just brushed away as “hahaha these boys are the worst, they’re athletes, but what can you do?!?!?!” It’s infuriating.this book is also one of many that use the trope ""well ive been with boys before but i've never orgasmed or enjoyed sex so i think im broken"" and Mr. Right comes along and suddenly she's a sexual goddess!!! i think it's just another version of the guy-fixes-girl trope, and i think it's really annoying. you can have orgasms and special connections with each of your partners; it doesn't all have to suddenly be ""aND HE WAS PERFECT FOR ME BECAUSE I CAME 10 TIMES!!! OUR LOVE IS LEGITIMIZED!!!!!"" At the most frustrating part of this book, she LITERALLY tells him, “I’m broken and I want you to fix me.” Don’t get me wrong, there’s definitely a compelling motivation there because she feels after being raped that she can never have normal, enjoyable sex. But that’s a problem to talk about with a therapist, not to assign to a random dude, or even a boyfriend. It’s just so wrong. She wants to use him to “reprogram her body to respond.” This just falls into the category of books I hate where I just want to scream GET HELP, NOT A BOYFRIEND.The few good parts about this book that I wish could have made it better:-When Hannah asks Garrett for the first time if he wants to have sex, it’s done really assertively and transparently. I like that she felt confident enough to be direct, and when he asked her why, she had no problem saying, “Because I want to.” That was a powerful moment for me. (Even though the scene ended by her saying ‘im broken, fix me.” it was nice while it lasted)-Garrett is SO much more attentive to her after he finds out she was raped. Almost to the point that I’d wished she told him sooner so that he could quit being an asshole. Still, he’s over-protective and their relationship and dialogue and descriptions fits every gender stereotype, so there’s a long way to go.-The sex scenes are really, really slow-going and consensual. Not entirely sexy and flawless, but not unbearable.","SQUEEE!!!! I loooooved this book!! I was hooked from the very first page and spent the rest of my afternoon laughing out loud, swooning, fanning myself, and highlighting awesome and hilarious quotes non-stop! So it's about this girl, Hannah, who is crushing hard on a football player. She's not one to usually get this mushy over a guy, but he's caught her eye and she wishes she was on his radar.The hero is a a guy named Garrett. He's a bad boy hockey player with a bit of a manwhoring reputation around campus who is in one of her classes and borderline failing. He's a smart guy, but this class just isn't his forte. Lucky for him, she's acing it... and he makes it his mission to get her to tutor him. Unfortunately for him though, she's not remotely interested in anything he has to offer in exchange.

“How about a date?” I offer.That gets her attention. She straightens up like someone shoved a metal rod up her spine, then swivels her head in astonishment. “What?”“Ah. I’ve got your attention.”“No, you’ve got my disgust. You actually think I want to go out with you?”“Everyone wants to go out with me.”She bursts out laughing…“Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?”“Two,” I reply cheerfully.. “I kiss each one of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.”She snorts. “Uh-huh. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Mr. Perfect, but I’m not interested in dating you."" 

After a few days of trying his best to wear her down, he finally comes up with an idea: he'll help elevate her social status by pretending to date her -- thus making her more likely to catch the eye of her crush IF she'll tutor him. She finally relents and the deal is formed.But the more time they spend together, the closer they get... and even though Garrett swore he didn't want a girlfriend, he falls for her... and makes it his mission to show her that he's actually the guy she wants.

I have to say, this is the first time a girl’s been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they’ve just bagged Brad Pitt.Hannah takes a breath. “We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That’s what happened. Got it?”I fight back laughter. “As you wish.” “Did you really just Princess Bride me?”“Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?”She glowers. 

I loved the way their relationship developed almost by accident. Neither of them meant for it to happen. They just began hanging out, spending time together, and one thing naturally led to another. (Side note: after reading about them watching Breaking Bad together, I kinda want to watch the show too!)Just to clear up a question I've been asked by several readers: there is NO cheating and no triangle in this story. He does hook up with two girls (literally just meaningless one-night stands) before he and Hannah become a couple. But once they're together, all that ends. So don't worry!This book had the ability to make me swoon one minute, put my heart in my throat the next, then literally make me burst right out laughing out of the blue. Here, I just have to share this one scene...

The guy protests… “I don’t think you should go in th—“I burst into the locker room and —Penises!Sweet Jesus.Penises everywhere.Horror slams into me as I register what I’m seeing. Oh God. I’ve stumbled onto a penis convention. Big penises and small penises and fat penises and penis-shaped penises. It doesn’t matter which direction I move my head because everywhere I look I see penises.My mortified gasp draws the attention of every penis — er, guy, in the room. In a heartbeat, towels snap up and hands cover junk and bodies shuffle around, while I stand in the front of the room blushing like a tomato. 

Teeheeeeee!!!! C'mon, doesn't that make you want to read the book?? :DYou'll swoon hard over Garrett, wish Hannah was your BFF, and totally get caught up in their story. It's fun, sexy, but with just enough 'seriousness' mixed in to ground the story as well. I really loved it!This was one of the best college romance I've read. It had epic banter, sexy romance, and fantastic writing!! I laughed, I swooned, I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended!!Rating: 5 stars. Standalone NA romance.PS: This is the first standalone in a series of standalones. The next book will be a different couple._______________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦ Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦ Facebook Blog Page✦ Twitter ✦ Subscribe by email","5 stars!

What can I say about The Deal that hasn’t been said in hundreds of other reviews… Well, I can say I regret being so late to the party on this one. I had a friend recommend this to me when she read it back in February and every few weeks I would get a message from her asking if I’d read it yet (thanks for pushing, Jen!) I can’t say why I waited to read this, I just got busy with other books. One things for sure though, I’ll be reading book 2 in this series very soon! No more waiting for me. Hannah Wells is a smart woman. She is so smart in fact, she’s one of the only people doing well in a certain class she’s in. Garrett is having trouble with this class and it’s bringing down his entire GPA, which he can’t have being a star hockey player and all. So there is one solution. Get Hannah to tutor him. There is also one problem, Hannah is resistant to Garrett’s charms. When she finally agrees, they strike a DEAL. They become friends, then they kiss. And everything changes. 

Hannah and Garrett were perfect together. I loved their banter and friendship. I loved even more when it developed. They had such fantastic chemistry. And it wasn’t just about the sex between them. Those weeks of friendship made them really care about one another and get to know each other. I can say with absolute certainty that there wasn’t one thing I didn’t love about this book. And as much as I love books and love to read, that doesn’t happen very often. I wouldn’t change a thing about this read. If you’re like me and haven't read this one yet, I encourage you to make it your next read. You won’t regret it!!!"
A Drop of Corruption,Robert Jackson Bennett,4.55,"4 1/2 stars. Even better than The Tainted Cup!I am having so much fun with this series. Even though it is a high fantasy setting with an incredibly detailed world, the tone of the stories reminds me very much of urban fantasy mysteries I've enjoyed over the years. Once again, the plot is a murder mystery, and, once again, the delightfully funny banter between Din and Ana drives the narrative.Before beginning this series I saw comparisons to Sherlock and Watson and I rolled my eyes and thought yeah, whatever, but it's actually a fairly good comparison in this case. Ana is just as brilliant as Cumberbatch's Sherlock, and even more prone to eccentricities and social faux pas. Din narrates the story Watson-style, recounting Ana's brilliance with no small amount of bafflement, while also showing ingenuity of his own.The mysteries in both books have been really well-crafted, layered and satisfying. I've gotten much better at discovering culprits and spotting wild twists after years of reading mysteries and thrillers, but I have so far found Bennett's mysteries impenetrable. I think it is because there is so much going on and each mystery opens up to an even larger mystery before it is solved. By the time I got to the ""Aha! So it's..."" point, Ana was confirming what I'd figured out in the next paragraph.But while much of this book is fun, underneath it is something deeper-- a criticism of autocracy in a genre enamored by kingdoms and divine rule. The author's note is a must-read.Now to wait for the next book.",dinios kol my disastrous bisexual son is back!! and hes sleep deprived!! he’s vomiting!!! he’s yearning!!! he’s slowly losing his marbles!! he’s in severe debt!! he’s in way over his head!!robert jackson bennetts competition continues to only be himself oh and i need kepheus back in book three or else!!Read my full review thank you to the entire del rey team for providing this arc Bookstagram | Blog,"By the last page I already knew this was pretty much perfect, but then I read the Author’s Note in the end and knew that it just got even better. You see, Bennett just happens to share the same views on hereditary power and strongmen in charge of autocracies as I do, and he’s very much clear about it, and it is such a refreshing view in the fantasy genre that otherwise seems hopelessly hung up on royalty and chosen ones and all that absolute nonsense. Me (and Bennett apparently) — it seems that we’d prefer a bureaucracy of checks and balances any time over any strongman who claims to been born out of “right” gametes.
“Because all the characters in this story—like all of humanity, apparently—have a little blank spot in their heads that says, “Kings. What a good idea.” The idea is powerful, and seductive, and should not be underestimated. To be a civilization of any worth, however, means acknowledging the idea—and then condemning it as laughably, madly stupid.”
And true to that, Bennett gives us another fantasy murder mystery adventure with two investigators - a brilliantly eccentric Ana Dolabra (
“If she isn’t included in whatever this is, there’ll be hell to pay,” I said. “This is not a threat, but just … physics. When defied, she breaks things.”
) and her pragmatic assistant Dinios Kol (who suffers from a bit of tired disillusionment from the job where every day, despite making a difference, you see more stuff happen that makes you feel that the difference you made is non-existent) in an Empire that runs on graft alterations of humans in a fascinatingly complex fantasy world where the Iudex - the law - are among exactly those checks and balances that keep everyone accountable and keep even the powerful in check. 
“This work can never satisfy, Din, for it can never finish. The dead cannot be restored. Vice and bribery will never be totally banished from the cantons. And the drop of corruption that lies within every society shall always persist. The duty of the Iudex is not to boldly vanquish it but to manage it. We keep the stain from spreading, yes, but it is never gone. Yet this job is perhaps the most important in all the Iyalets, for without it, well … The Empire would come to look much like Yarrow, where the powerful and the cruel prevail without check. And tell me—does that realm look capable of fighting off a leviathan?”



It’s a wonderfully complex murder and political mystery that flies along through a few hundred pages without ever missing a beat, without ever dragging or rushing, paced perfectly and with constant tension and high stakes and the satisfying feeling you get when you read a story that’s plotted and executed with confident mastery. The fantasy world feels unique and well-developed, and Bennett’s world-building is top-notch as usual, and the characters are fun to follow (although a few scenes with Ana’s peculiar feasts made me want to unsee the paragraphs I just read and skip dinner), and I’d be glad to read a few books set in this universe. 
“But … when we come, the deed is already done. The body is cold, the blood cleaned away. We often find the killer, but that heals nothing, as far as I can see. It only leads to a rope, or a cage, and many more tears.” I swallowed. “Is it so strange a thing, ma’am, to helplessly look upon the slain and dream of instead saving lives?” 
Bennett, as usual, develops pretty serious themes throughout, seamlessly integrating them into the story without the slightest didacticism. The corruption that comes with power and greed and the need for someone to put in the effort to keep that corruption in check — it’s something we all can use more of in the real world just as much as Bennett’s characters can use it in theirs. As Ana says to somewhat disillusioned Din, 
 “I suspect you shall come to realize what many Iudexii eventually learn—that though the Legion defends our Empire, it falls to us to keep an Empire worth defending.”
5 stars with no hesitation. I love it as much as his Divine Cities series, although this one is a lighter, less gloomy read.  My review of the first book in the series, The Tainted Cup. ——————Thanks to NetGalley and Random House / Del Rey for providing me with a digital ARC in exchange for an honest review. 
 “You know, you are not a stupid person, Din.” “Thank you, ma’am,” I said, pleased. “Or, rather, not an unusually stupid person.” “Thank you, ma’am,” I said, far less pleased.

Murder by Cheesecake,Rachel Ekstrom Courage,3.63,"**3.5-stars rounded up**My initial thoughts upon first hearing the concept for this book were as follows:I cannot even believe this is a thing. It's like all my dreams have come true. No one is a bigger GG-fan than me!! To have the Girls all together to solve a Cozy Mystery?!What the heck could be better!?I put off reading it for as long as I could, wanting to read it just prior to the publication date, April 15, 2025. In my eyes, it couldn't come soon enough.And I'll tell you what, I did really enjoy it. Was it perfect? No, but it didn't need to be. I feel like a lot of Cozy Mystery series get better as they go, as they find their rhythm and as Readers become more attached to the characters.While I don't think it's possible for me to be more attached to Sophia, Blanche, Dorothy and Rose than I already am, I do think if the series continues, I will grow to love the format and mystery of the novels more and more.In this story, we have two things happening. Rose is preparing to host a wedding for her cousin, Nettie, and her beau, Jason, wherein an inheritance clause makes it necessary for the wedding to contain many St. Olafian traditions, so that is a focus of a lot of the action.Additionally, we have a dead body found on the premises where the wedding is to take place, and due to circumstances I won't get into, Dorothy is considered a lead suspect.Because of all of this, the Girls are trying to clear Dorothy's name, while also giving Nettie the wedding of her dreams. It's a lot for a weekend!By the end of the 1st-chapter, I was already impressed by the way the author captured each of the Girls' personalities and mannerisms; minus Sophia using a cane, which I am still scratching my head about.It was so easy for me to read, picturing all of their intonations and comedic deliveries. It was just incredibly enjoyable for me as a super fan.Overall, I found it to be a super cute, very fun, and nostalgic read for me. I felt like all four women, Dorothy, Rose, Sophia and Blanche, were executed with grace, and in a way that would make any fan of the show happy.At times I would have preferred the mystery to be a bit more front-and-center, in comparison to the drama circling Nettie's wedding. Nevertheless, it was still a great read!I'm actually not sure if this is slated to be a series, or not, but I'm really hoping for more. There's so many more opportunities for mysteries. Miami is a busy place and these Girls are always getting into some sort of sticky situation.I would recommend this to any Golden Girls fan. I don't think it would hit the same for people who haven't watched the show, but I could be wrong. As a Cozy Mystery, it was still solid, regardless of who the characters are.Thank you so much for the ARC, Hyperion Avenue. This was a hugely-anticipated release for me, and I'm honored to have received a copy early.Thank you, thank you!","Can I tell you about the speed with which I R.A.N. to NetGalley to beg for an early copy of this as soon as I saw it???? And then I read it . . . . 

Oof. This was rough so let’s talk about the positives for a second. Obviously GOLDEN GIRLS. I mean that is just a winner. And the idea of our favorite ladies from the ‘80s Scooby Dooing about Miami? Talk about the chef’s kiss of a cozy. Title and cover art? Fantastic. Staying true to the girls’ personalities and banter? Perfection. But then there was the story itself. Waaaaaay too much wedding and way too little what happened to the dead guy in the freezer. The St. Olaf traditions schtick got old super fast and unfortunately the author doubled down on things to the point where my beloved Rose was not so likeable. The key to a cozy is truly the K.I.S.S. method – keep it simple, stupid. The wedding should have simply been a vessel to introduce the dead body in the freezer – not overtaken the entire story.That being said, there is zero chance I won’t be buying a copy of this for my bookshelves if only for the nostalgia it provided and I will absolutely read the next in the series with high hopes that it finds its groove.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you, NetGalley!","I remember watching the last few seasons of Golden Girls when it was still on the air, and decades later, I've rewatched the entire series a few times. Actually, we started again for the new year and watch an episode before bed many weeknights. When the book was announced, I giggled. It could be terrible, it could be amusing. It hit my queue last week, so I jumped on in. The author does a good job balancing the comedic zingers and exuberant personalities, as well as drawing a bit of a caricature for the traits that define each of the 4 women. All their exploits are front-and-center, tho this is primarily about Rose and Dorothy. There are moments (like most cozies) where I worry it's not plausible, and there are others where things are too coincidental, but it's a lovely balance of all it is supposed to be. If you're a fan of the show and like extended fan fiction, you'll enjoy this. If you're the kind of reader who picks away at something because that's just what you do, stay away. For two reasons - stop being such a grumpy reviewer who enjoys ruining things for other people and you weren't going to like it anyway so why bother? But for most fans of the show who are readers and who enjoy light mysteries, you'll relish!"
How to Seal Your Own Fate,Kristen Perrin,3.76,"Kristen Perrin's How to Seal Your Own Fate is an absolute treat for mystery lovers, serving up a deliciously twisty tale set in the delightfully atmospheric Castle Knoll. Amateur sleuth Annie Adams is back, and this time she's caught up in a mind-bending mystery that starts with a fortune teller's cryptic message and spirals into something far more sinister.Imagine a story that's one part small-town gossip, one part family secret, and two parts pure intrigue. Perrin masterfully weaves between present-day investigations and her great-aunt Frances' daring detective work from the 1960s, creating a narrative that's impossible to put down. It's like having two brilliant detectives working the same case across different decades – and trust me, you'll be rooting for both of them.The real magic happens in how Perrin connects the dots between past and present. Annie's cautious modern-day sleuthing plays beautifully against Frances' bold investigative spirit, creating a rich tapestry of family history and long-buried secrets. Each page feels like lifting another layer of an intricate mystery, with just enough breadcrumbs to keep you guessing.Sure, there are moments when the pacing takes a slight breather, but that's hardly a complaint when the storytelling is this engaging. The book captures that perfect small-town mystery vibe – you can almost feel the weight of decades-old secrets hanging in the air, just waiting to be uncovered.How to Seal Your Own Fate is exactly what you want in a mystery: smart, surprising, and utterly compelling. Perrin proves she's a master at crafting mysteries that are as emotionally rich as they are intellectually satisfying. If you're looking for a story that will keep you guessing until the very last page, this is your ticket to a delightful reading adventure.Grab a cup of tea, settle into your favorite reading nook, and prepare to be thoroughly entertained. Castle Knoll is calling, and this mystery is too good to miss.Many thanks to NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP Dutton | Dutton for sharing this unputdownable mystery's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.","Ugh, can't say I love an unnecessary sequel whose purpose is to complicate an already confusing story and making less credible the previous book.While the first book in the Castle Knoll Files series, 
How to Solve Your Own Murder
, was somehow justified as a debut mystery, this one is the copycat of something we’ve already seen happening and still confused us.And this time we also have the foundation for a third book, which will probably be the same as the previous two but with slightly different characters (again).Generally speaking, this was fine. There's action, a mystery to solve, a spark of romance and a good recapping ending that makes sense and gives the idea of a HEA.But… I just hate the idea of not understanding what’s happening. Like, I have even taken notes this time — since in the first book I just came to the conclusion I wasn't smart enough — and it still doesn't make sense how the FMC comes to her realisations. She's the only one to put together the pieces of the story, and she does it not as a narrator who also explains to us but it just happens inside her head; and then, in the last chapter, she resumes what happened to us (and to the police officer), so we can close the book happy about it.At this point, I just think I'm not a fan of her writing style or her scheming to get everything right — if she loves to confuse us too or if that's just a bonus idk.Also, I'm not a fan of a mystery that takes place and gets resolved in the span of three days when it’s pretty clear that nothing else has happened since the last murder — six months and our writer hasn’t written a single word, or took a single photo, or even modernized her new mansion.I don't wanna be a complete hypocrite because I read the whole thing in a day and a half, and I’ll also likely read the next book, but it’s fair to say this one was a bit pointless.↠ 3 starsThanks to Dutton and NetGalley, who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest opinion.","How I LOVED the first book in this series!!!!Another fun book by this author, totally worth the read. This is the second novel in the series and does not disappoint. Always a fun mystery, leaving me turning page after page to put all the pieces together. I thought I placed the story but I was not at all correct. An excellent read and highly recommended novel. We continue the story from the first book with a new twist to the mystery…who is the woman who gave the great-aunt the fortune of death, and why? Told from the FMC’s pov and old journal entries of the great-aunt, I found myself able to easily to swap back and forth and equally interested in both storylines. The unfolding of story was just as good as the first book and I loved every minute."
This Is Not a Game,Kelly Mullen,3.55,"A quick, easy read filled with suspicious personas alongside two fun amateur sleuths, This Is Not a Game was the perfect palate cleanser for this thriller lover. Pulling inspiration from Golden Age locked room murder mystery novels, Ms. Mullen added a healthy dose of hilarity laced with plenty of sarcasm. From the layers of secrets to the endearing relationship between Addie and Mimi, I was quickly pulled into this doozy of a tale. Complex, atmospheric, and complete with a few red herrings as well as some subtle clues, it was everything I could want, including a finale complete with a classic dénouement.Despite a plot that could have rivaled some of Ms. Agatha Christie’s, the characters were easily the special sauce in this cozy-ish mystery. Eccentric, quirky, and running the gamut from charming to vile, the complex group dynamics and isolated setting made this book an out-and-out winner. You see, the moat-surrounded mansion felt like yet another persona. With a maze of secret passages and even a drawbridge, it made my list for best locked room setting in no time at all. Combined with the dual POVs of Addie and Mimi, who won me over hook, line, and sinker, this lighthearted read was an utter slam dunk.All said and done, despite the need to suspend all disbelief, Ms. Kelly Mullen has penned quite the debut. With natural dialogue, giggle-worthy humor, and a definite Knives Out feel, there simply wasn’t much there not to love. Granted, the theorizing got a tad thick there in the middle, but what else can you expect in a whodunnit? Now I’m just wishing and hoping that it was just the first installment of this unlikely sleuthing duo. After all, there’s so much more to be told about their unfolding story. So if you love a plot grounded in blackmail and characters who will fill you with suspicion, grab this book ASAP. Rating of 4.5 stars.SYNOPSIS:Widow Mimi lives on idyllic Mackinac Island, where cars are not allowed and a Gibson martini with three onions at the witching hour is compulsory. Her estranged granddaughter, Addie, is getting over the heartbreak of not only being dumped by her fiancé, Brian, but also being cut out of the deal for the brilliantly successful video game Murderscape they invented together (with Addie doing most of the heavy lifting). When Mimi gets an invitation from local socialite Jane Ireland—a seventysomething narcissist who’s having a salacious affair with her son-in-law—to a charity auction, she invites Addie. But Mimi doesn’t tell her that a blackmail threat from Jane looms over the party’s invitation. Once they arrive, a big storm rolls in, trapping everyone in the mansion. And then, Jane is murdered. Soon Mimi and Addie’s strained relationship is put to the test when they must team up to narrow down the suspects. When another body turns up, the sleuthing pair realize someone else is playing a deadly game, and they might not survive the night.Thank you to Kelly Mullen and Dutton Books for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: April 8, 2025Content warning: blackmail, gun violence, mention of: gaslighting","HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY!A cozy debut!I usually choose my cozy mysteries very carefully, as this is not my favorite genre. But after reading the enticing synopsis of This is Not a Game, I thought I would give this debut a try. When Rosemary (Mimi) is invited (blackmailed) to attend an auction by the Mackinac island socialite Jane Ireland, she asks her estranged granddaughter Addie to attend with her. During the event, a snowstorm ensues and the power goes out, leaving them trapped in an Agatha Christie style locked room mystery. When Jane is murdered, everyone is a suspect. It is up to Mimi and Addie to find the killer before more partygoers turn up dead. Thankfully, Addie is the co-creater of the successful video game Murderscape and knows how to solve complicated murder mysteries. This is Not a Game is an atmospheric mystery with a sense of humor. From Mimi’s snowmobile named Joan Rivers, to her Mary Poppins style carryall bag, she embodies the quirky old lady stereotype. But don’t underestimate this seventy-seven year old crossword and Gibson loving grandma. She is a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that she is hiding her own secret. However, I didn’t find Addie to be as intriguing. The reader is constantly reminded about the video game she helped create through her comparisons to the current mystery she is solving. This becomes tiresome and irritating instead of adding depth to the story. It also feels as if the chemistry is missing from this sleuthing duo.Overall, This is Not a Game is a promising debut for Mullen, but not quite a home run. 3.5/5 stars rounded downExpected publication date: 4/8/25Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group - Dutton for the ARC of This is Not a Game in exchange for an honest review.","If you’re a fan of Agatha Christie’s And Then There None, The Golden Girls, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow, then you will want to preorder this gem of a mystery right now!Some of the reasons I loved this book: ♜ Locked Room Mystery♜ Blackmail♜ Multi-generational sleuths (granddaughter and grandmother)♜ Mansion on Mackinac Island setting♜ Lavish party with an unusual guest list♜ Snowstorm♜ Witty banter♜ Gaming references♜ Delicious food descriptions♜ Cleverly plotted whodunitEveryone is going to fall in love with Mimi, the Gibson-guzzling grandma."
Death on the Island,Eliza  Reid,3.56,"In Death on the Island, we follow an eclectic group of characters who come together in a tiny island community off the coast of Iceland for a diplomatic event.We have the mayor of the town, an Ambassador from Canada and his wife, a local high-profile chef, an artist with ties to the island, and others. They all come together for a special dinner to open up their talks and hopefully create good spirits amongst the group.It's supposed to be a joyous occasion, and it does seem to start out that way. That is until one of the guests ends up dead of unknown causes, but what everyone quickly assumes to be poison consumption.Making matters worse, a brutal storm is bearing down on them. It's clear no one is going to be leaving the island. All the better to catch a killer, but in the meantime, doesn't that mean they're trapped with one?I had a blast reading Death on the Island. I went into it with zero expectations. I hadn't heard of this author, or any buzz for the book, but the title screamed, READ ME!!!I'm so glad I made the time for it. I was completely engaged from the start. It actually turns out this is the author's debut novel, and I'm so excited for more.I appreciated how quickly Reid gets us into the action. I was drawn into the story so fast. I liked that we were following political figures, such as ambassadors and mayors. I haven't read one like that in a while, so it was a nice change of pace.I enjoyed how the author formatted the story as well. You get the reveal of the death, and then you go back in time and track through the events leading up to that death. It was done in a countdown-style that I feel added a level of tension to it that might not have been there otherwise.Learning about this cast of characters, as well as their relationships to one another and potential motivations for why someone would take out anyone at this dinner party, was very entertaining. There was certainly plenty of drama to oh-and-ah over. With this being said, I'll admit there's a lot of moving parts and it was a little hard to track in the beginning. For a minute, I started to feel overwhelmed, but I tried to just relax into it, not worry too much about the details, and to just let Reid do her thing.Ultimately, Reid pulled it off. This had me so invested, I had no longstanding issues tracking the various characters, or their interpersonal dramas.Overall, I loved the atmospheric-island setting, which was done so well in my humble island-dweller opinion. I also really enjoyed the use of an inclement weather element to help build out that tense atmosphere, as well as the interesting cast of characters. It was so gripping trying to solve this murder mystery, my head was all over the place. I did Buddy Read it with a friend, and definitely recommend that. It was so fun trying to guess the killer together, and their reasons behind it.Thank you to the publisher, Poisoned Pen Press, for providing me a copy to read and review. I loved how this kept me guessing, and I'm looking forward to more from Eliza Reid!!!","ARC for review. To be published May 13, 2025. 2 stars. This book is marketed as a debut but the author has other books listed in the Goodreads database. A group of “international players” (from the book description….these people are NOT really international players, except for one guy) are also n a tiny village on an island offf the coast of Iceland for your standard meet and greet with an unspoken agenda as Graeme, Canada’s ambassador to Iceland is seeking to make a business deal. Jane, his wife, is along for the ride, as she is so often. There’s Hanna, whose art exhibit they are all ostensibly there to view, Kavita, the deputy ambassador, her husband, Rahal, Kristjan, mayor of the town, Ben, Jane’s friend and a Booker Prize winner and Thor and Linda, owners of a major frozen fish company in Iceland. Soon one of them will be dead and it will be up to Jane to solve the crime because they are trapped on the island due to bad weather (of course.) I was really rooting for this little mystery. I love books set in Iceland, Greenland, etc. I loved locked room mysteries. The description of the dinner was great. I would have loved more I eland specific details like that. Vestmannaeyjar sounds like a great town. But this was dull. Dull, dull, dull. I’m sorry to say it, but it’s true. Disappointing.","A locked room mystery in storm on an isolated island off Iceland, what a perfect setting for a murder mystery. This was a great debut with an eclectic cast of characters. We have a celebrity chef, a prize winning author and an abundance of authors at a dinner in a top restaurant. After a Flaming Viking cocktail, one of them drops dead. It is the second death on the island in 2 months, which is suspicious.There is so much going on behind the scenes with all of these characters. They all seem to have grudges with each other, reason to want each other dead. It was also nice to learn a it about Iceland along the way. I had a little inkling of the killer, but as always I was wrong!!Thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for my copy of this book to read. Out on May 13th."
Murder Between Friends,Liz Lawson,3.83,"Liz Lawson, known for co-writing The Agathas series, delivers a gripping solo effort with this fast-paced crime thriller set against a backdrop of small-town politics, drugs, and high school drama. The story keeps readers guessing until the very last pages with well-executed twists that are impossible to see coming. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was as captivating and intriguing as The Agathas, and I highly recommend it to YA thriller enthusiasts.While it might seem far-fetched for a group of teens to outsmart law enforcement, the book provides a plausible explanation for how the justice system can sometimes fail and how the truth can be distorted through different viewpoints. I found the amateur detective work of Ally, Grace, and Henry compelling, as each of them has a personal stake in uncovering the truth behind their English teacher’s murder. Grace, who testified that she saw Jake, Henry’s older brother, entering the teacher’s house on the day of the crime, lost her friendships with both Henry and Ally as a result. Henry sided with Jake, while Ally refused to believe Jake was capable of such a heinous act.When Jake is released after serving two years in prison due to a corrupt judge and prosecutor’s secret relationship, Grace starts to question what she really saw. Did she misinterpret the events of that night? She remembers seeing someone wearing Jake's jacket, but she never actually saw his face. As doubt creeps in, Grace wonders if she should risk changing her testimony, even if it means potentially facing charges for obstructing justice.Grace soon discovers that Ally and Henry have been conducting their own secret investigation. Although Ally still harbors resentment toward Grace for the fallout from her testimony and for not supporting her after her father’s death, Henry is more forgiving and agrees to let Grace join their efforts. Together, they search for the truth, but as they dig deeper, they uncover secrets that could endanger powerful people, putting the trio in more danger than they ever anticipated.In addition to the teacher’s murder, Ally is determined to find out what really happened to her father. Will they uncover the answers they seek, even if the truth turns out to be more painful than expected?Overall, while Ally’s stubbornness occasionally made her a frustrating character, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book. I’m rounding up my 4.5-star rating to a full 5 stars for this compelling young detective mystery.A big thank you to NetGalley and Random House Children’s/Delacorte Press for providing me with a digital review copy in exchange for my honest opinion.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","Packed full of suspicious individuals and realistic high school drama, Murder Between Friends brought the small town of Brawner to life right there on the page. With convincing amateur sleuths, unguessable twists, and a ratcheting pace that pulled me in deep, I couldn’t put this book down and read it in only a matter of hours. After all, I was duly impressed by the genuine high school feel that brought me right back to those long-forgotten bygone days. From the angsty relationships to the teenage belief of utter invincibility, Lawson drew these dynamite characters with downright perfection throughout this YA mystery novel that managed to spin tales within tales.The only issue that I had with this book was the need to suspend all disbelief. While I love a good teen investigation, the idea that three wily kids could outsmart the cops, lawyers, and parents was quite simply absurd. Once I placed that aside, though, I found myself wrapped up in a complex plot that quickly took off despite its somewhat slow start. I mean, the deliciously unhinged climax and jaw-dropping twists easily made up for the initial sedate pace all things considered.All in all, with a diverse cast, compelling first-person narration, and short, inhale-able chapters, there was no end to the fun in this delightful whodunnit. And let me tell you, just when I thought it was all over, an additional ballbuster of a twist arrived on the scene. Delivering a few shocking revelations before ending with a smile-inducing conclusion, I loved how it wrapped up the story with utter precision. So if you love suspense, murder, drama, romance, and intrigue, this is most definitely the novel for you. Just be sure to expect a less adult vibe amidst the long-buried secrets. After all, even though it works for adults, it was still written for teens. Rating of 4 stars.SYNOPSIS:Grace, Henry, and Ally grew up together on the same block. They used to be best friends--until Grace's testimony put Henry's brother, Jake, away for killing their English teacher. Now, two years later, Ally and Henry hate Grace, and Grace is doubting what she thinks she saw that night. It feels like everyone's getting a second chance, then, when due to a mistrial, Jake is suddenly released. And Henry knows his brother is innocent, but when Grace reaches out to say she’s rethinking what she saw the night of the murder, Jake’s reaction is confusing. He doesn’t want Henry—or Grace--getting involved.For Ally not getting involved isn’t an option, and there’s nothing Grace can say to convince Ally she’s not the enemy. But can Ally afford to push Grace out when she’s one of the only other people willing to believe in Jake’s innocence? The clock is ticking. Jake’s new trial date is about to be set, and he's sure to be found guilty again unless there's new evidence to prove he's innocent. Grace, Henry, and Ally are going to have to decide whether you can trust an old friend now that they’re your enemy.Thank you to Liz Lawson, Delacorte Press, and Get Underlined for my complimentary copy.

OVERVIEW
-i’m ngl. this just wasn’t holding my interest.at first i was sucked in. it had a strong beginning, but after around 12% i just couldn’t focus. idk if this was to do with the plot or if that’s all on me (probably the latter if i’m being honest). but it didn’t feel like i was reading a book i liked. it felt like i was slogging through thick mud.if you were to ask me what stood out to me in this book, i would say ‘the phone numbers’. lwk idk if the numbers are real but i was curious to see what would happen if i dialed them 😀💅all this being said, i would possibly pick this book up again in the future when i’m in the mood for a thriller. but as a mood reader, thrillers just don’t sound good to me rn. if i had the wherewithal to read this book at this point in time, chances are i would enjoy itbut i have neither time nor energy nor desire to. :(-ZE WRITING-i will say, i loved it. the prose was nice and the pacing was pretty good.i read the agathas a few years back which was co-written by liz, and i loved it. it was one of the first thriller books i’ve read so i’m no stranger to her writing. it was nostalgic in a wayi have no hate for this book, in fact, i would recommend it if i knew if there’s any other content in the second half-
PLOT
-annddddd my usual youtube clickbait title description of the book 😋my boyfriend’s brother’s in prison and it’s all my fault *shocking*that’s not a spoiler btw bc it was in the first chapter and it might also be in the summary but i haven’t read it 🥲😅but the whole point of the book is a friend group gets broken up bc one of them testified against the other friend’s brother and gets him in prison 🤠-
CHARACTERS
-ngl none of them made an imprint on me.ally was selfish and has trust issueshenry is TOO trustingand grace reminds me of my friend 😭-

The Matchmaker,Aisha Saeed,3.65,"This is my debut adult novel, and I hope you enjoy reading this story as much as I enjoyed writing it! :)","3.5🌟Ready to find your perfect match?When I first glanced at the cover for this book, I thought I was going to be a fun rom-com.An ironic situation that finds a matchmaker who finds the perfect person for everyone…but unable to find her own match.And yes, that was part of the book. But, there was also a completely different side to this storyline. More on that shortly.Nura has taken over the family business, providing an exclusive matchmaking service. Highly successful, many apply but only a few are selected. When two recent weddings are sabotaged Nura knows it somehow ties back to her.Now she finds herself being stalked in person and on line. Her home is broken into and threatening messages are being sent. Wait! Hold up, here! I thought this was going to be a sweet romance? Not a murder mystery!?This book definitely had an identity crisis. Apparently it's listed as both a mystery and a romance. Something I clearly overlooked when accepting this read.😅But with both genres competing for dominance each gave up a bit of themselves along the way. I wanted the author to choose a lane and stay in it. But just as I got comfortable in the romance or the mystery, oops…It would flip again!‍🤦🏼‍♀️Overall I did enjoy this ro-mystery.😉.I think this author has the talent for both genres. But maybe just pick one at a time?‍🤷🏼‍♀️Thank you to Random House Publishing via NetGalley","3.5 StarsFast paced and entertaining, reading The Matchmaker makes me want to go and read Aisha Saeed’s backlist. There’s something for everyone in this book: suspense, relationships, culture, and laughs. Nura is a renowned matchmaker in Atlanta who runs her company with professionalism and passion. Yet not everyone seems to be thrilled with her work as threatening letters and a podcast appear and her clients nuptials are sabotaged. Nura relies on her employees (who are really more like friends) and her best friend Azar (who she longs to be more than just friends) to help her solve the mystery and keep her sane. Nura’s close relationship with her aunt is also prevalent as is the rocky one with her cousin, and it was great seeing the family dynamics of a close knit group who make mistakes but still love each other. It becomes a balancing act as Nura attempts to run her business, find the culprit, accept the changing dynamics between her and Azur, and stay present in meaningful ways for her family. And while it seems like a lot, the story seamlessly moves between each piece, bringing it altogether in the end.  I received an advanced copy through Netgalley in return for an honest review."
Coram House,Bailey  Seybolt,3.74,"An atmospheric mystery that had me visualizing every scene, Coram House took me into the dark, snowy depths of a spine-chilling Vermont tale. Based on a true story, you could feel the ghosts of the past echoing into the present as the protagonist searched for the truth in this complex, deftly woven case full of long-buried secrets. Like unraveling a ball of yarn, we were escorted closer and closer to a series of shocking revelations via a plot that shifted and turned until the final jaw-dropping reveal. The best piece of all, though? That had to be how I guessed not one single twist from beginning to end of this compelling slow burn.But let’s get down to business. From the immersive mixed media format to the lyrical prose that made the setting come alive, this well-written debut novel pulled me in deep. You see, despite the intricate plot and many “what ifs,” I became fully invested in both the outcome of Alex’s investigation of the past and who was up to no good in the present. What really won me over, however, was Alex. Fully fleshed out and intensely well-developed, her flaws humanized her and, via a dynamic character arc, made the book sing. All told, the characterization was downright perfection in my humble opinion.All said and done, thanks to an original premise and plenty of individuals who made me suspicious, this dark tale had me applauding. After all, looking back, there was no end to the subtle clues that were mixed in with clever red herrings. As for the truth to the story, the narrative managed to expertly craft a dark history that burned with veracity while also treating it with sensitivity and tact. Ultimately, it was no great surprise that I was blown away. Taut, intense, and hypnotic, once I got pulled into this two-pronged whodunnit, I wasn’t able to put the book down. Rating of 4.5 stars.SYNOPSIS:On a blistering summer day in 1968, nine-year-old Tommy vanishes without a trace from Coram House, an orphanage on the shores of Lake Champlain. Some say a nun drowned him, others say he ran away. Or maybe he never existed. Fifty years later, his disappearance is still unsolved.Struggling true crime writer Alex Kelley needs a fresh start. When she’s asked to ghostwrite a book about the orphanage—and the abuses that occurred there—she packs up her belongings and moves to wintry Burlington, Vermont.As Alex tries to untangle the conflicting stories surrounding Tommy’s disappearance, her investigation takes a chilling turn when she discovers a woman’s body in the lake. Alex is convinced the death is connected to Coram House’s dark past, even if local police officer Russell Parker thinks she’s just desperate for a career-saving story. As the body count rises, Alex must prove that the key to finding the killer lies in Tommy’s murder, or risk becoming the next victim.Thank you to Bailey Seybolt and Atria Books for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: April 15, 2025Content warning: murder, blackmail, suicide, mention of: child abuse and pedophilia within a Catholic orphanage","This is a page-turning and gritty mystery novel. I liked the backstory of the main character: a true crime writer who has known both wild success and dismal failure with her past projects. Please be aware of trigger warnings, as the plot involves historical child abuse at religious institutions, loosely based on terrible real-life crimes at St Joseph's Orphanage in Vermont. This topic felt grimly relevant given recent news in the UK, but can be tough reading. This is an impressive debut, and I look forward to reading more from this author.Many thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for the advance copy.","A promising debut!Inspired by a true story, Coram House is a quick read that keeps readers guessing, questioning, and engaged. Alex Kelley is a true crime writer who is asked to ghostwrite a book about a Vermont orphanage and the abuses that occurred there. In 1968, a nine-year-old boy vanished without a trace from Coram House. Did he run away? Drown? Did he even really exist? Soon after her arrival, Alex discovers a dead woman in the lake and is convinced her death is connected to Coram House’s dark past. As the body count rises, Alex must prove that the murders are connected to the boy’s disappearance.I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Cassandra Campbell, Chris Henry Coffey, Jason Culp, and Jackie Sanders. I really enjoyed this format, despite needing to speed up the playback to 1.75x.If you are looking for a strongly narrative and easy to follow mystery plot, Coram House ticks all of the boxes. While I wasn’t super moved by any of the characters, I enjoyed how Seybolt pieced together the mystery of the missing boy. The interspersing of court documents helped to break up the plot and added pertinent information from the past timeline. Seybolt shows promise in this genre and I would gladly read her next offering. 3.5/5 stars rounded down"
A Proposal to Die For,Molly Harper,3.88,"This is Molly Harper at her finest! I loved how witty, fast-paced and fun this book was (as fun as murder can be). While not the core of the story, the romance is sweet while also not playing into any damsel-in-distress moments that can get tiresome. The mystery had plenty of twists and turns, and finding out the why and how even more than the who was very satisfying. Even the characters that were meant to be despicable still proved interesting and multifaceted and provided great fodder for Harper’s witty and biting commentary. If you like Molly Harper’s other books, but don’t think crime is your jam-I promise you, this will still be a book you’ll love and want to add to your TBR ASAP.","˚ ༘♡ pre-read: ╰┈➤ received an arc march 13th, 2025received this arc and a romance mystery soundsss soooooo good rn! excited for this one⋆˚࿔ a proposal to die for review 𝜗𝜚˚⋆  ┆ ⤿ 💌 3 stars! this story features a proposal planner who gets involved with a murder at a spa retreat with her client and her large friend group. I really liked the premise but the first about 40-50% of the book is hard to get into. I feel like i was thrown into this story and group of people with no real context. I constantly found myself getting lost in all the names and positions I needed to try to remember. I didn't really care much about the bride and her toxic friendships but things did begin to really pick up once we were introduced to the MMC chef and the murder takes place. Once we were more involved in the mystery I definitely began to enjoy it more! I had fun following all the clues and think the book ended relatively well! Overall, a very slow start but fun once you get into the story and murder!Thank you to Berkley for an arc in exchange for an honest review! <3｡ﾟ• ┈ ┈ ┈ ┈꒰ა ♡ ໒꒱┈ ┈ ┈ ┈• ｡ﾟ⤿ follow me on instagram!",Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for my honest opinion. This was a cozy mystery with a dash of romance. Jess has been hired to orchestrate the proposal of Trenton to future bridezilla Diana. But she keeps stumbling onto dead bodies and drama. She was such a relatable character and I was right there wanting to wring the necks of her insufferable clients and their company. Also can we talk about how swoon worthy Dean is! I really hope this turns into a series. I would love to see more of Dean’s relatives.
One Death at a Time,Abbi Waxman,3.81,"I still adore Abbi Waxman, even if I didn’t totally adore this book!I loved The Bookish Life of Nina Hill and liked Adult Assembly Required, both of which were romance/women’s fiction, which she’s SO good at! I was excited to see her try her hand at a cozy mystery. It was decent - it just didn’t work as well for me as her efforts in her usual genres.I won’t rehash the entire plot - there are plenty of reviews or the blurb for that. I’ll only say that aging alcoholic actress Julia Mann has been accused of murdering an old professional nemesis - the second time she’s been arrested for a murder, and she joins forces with her twenty-something AA sponsor/personal assistant (Natasha) Mason to solve the mystery.For me, this was too long with too many characters to keep track of, the story was chaotic at times, and I struggled to find a single character I liked or cared about - especially the two aforementioned leads. Julia is bossy and has a mouth like a sailor and Mason is just downright obnoxious most of the time. While some might find them funny - the humor wasn’t landing for me. On the good side, the mystery was solid and despite the dreaded villain monologue, I did find the explanation believable and surprisingly thought-provoking. The insights into Hollywood and the machinations of the film industry were fascinating! I also respect the insights Waxman provided into alcoholism and addiction, which was a major issue for both leads. If you have a family member with the disease, you may find all the talk about it triggering. I did. 🙋🏻It’s a decent mystery which seems to hint at a possible sequel or series. The many four and five star reviews on this one shows there’s an audience for it. I just hope Waxman doesn’t completely leave her romance roots behind!★★★ Thanks to Berkley Publishing, NetGalley and author Abbi Waxman for this digital ARC to honestly review. It’s out on April 15, 2025.","One Death at a Time is a quirky and fun cozy murder mystery with delightful characters. There's a Gen Z recovering alcoholic who doesn't quite have her life together, an ex-con former Hollywood actress with an attitude problem, a dead man in a swimming pool (the mortal enemy of the aforementioned ex-actress … the dead man, that is, not the pool), and a whole lot of criminal shenanigans. I mean, forget the murder, you guys … there's golf cart theft and (justified) dog-napping in this one. This is a fairly frenetic novel – no one ever seems to sleep and they're constantly driving all over Los Angeles (and beyond) and people are getting attacked left and right and everyone's always eating and basically I feel bad for Mason's cat because when is she ever home to actually pet the poor thing? Mild cat neglect aside, however, it's all pretty entertaining and Julia and Mason make an amusing pair. There's lots of sass and wit and humor, and the mystery itself is slightly absurd but in a well-written way. This is definitely a story that doesn't take itself too seriously – it's not exactly Agatha Christie, but it's also not really supposed be. So, yeah. The characters are great. The plot is great. The animals all live to see the end of the book. My one minor complaint is the big reveal – the murderer's actions and reasonings just seem so, so over the top. Not that the rest of this novel is exactly … restrained, but, I dunno, they just seem so excessively bitter and obsessed that it takes a bit of the fun out of it. At the same time, though, I guess I kind of get it? I mean, I wouldn't murder anyone over it, but you do you, crazy murderer person.Oh, and there's not much romance, which is nice if you're not into that sort of thing. There's some mild attraction between two characters but that's about as far as the lovey-dovey stuff goes. If you're normally a fan of humorous cozy mysteries with eccentric characters, definitely consider giving One Death at a Time a read. It's pretty great and it looks like it could possibly be the first book in a (hopefully awesome) new series?My overall rating: 3.95 stars, rounded up.Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review. Its expected publication date is April 15, 2025.","In Abbi Waxman's latest cozy mystery, former actress Julia Mann, who’s no stranger to murder accusations, teams up with her Gen Z sobriety sponsor Natasha Mason to solve a murder that threatens to send her back to prison. After Julia discovers a dead body in her swimming pool, the police immediately suspect her due to her criminal past. Though Julia would rather be left alone, Natasha is determined to prove her innocence and keep her sober in the process.The story kicks off when Julia and Natasha meet at an AA meeting, forging an unlikely partnership that propels them through the glamorous, yet treacherous, landscapes of Hollywood Hills, burlesque venues, and the country clubs of Palm Springs. Joined by a colorful cast of showgirls, agents, and even cat burglars, the duo embarks on a fast-paced journey filled with twists, dead piranhas, and giant martini glasses, leading to a series of witty and entertaining revelations. However, secrets from their own pasts threaten to complicate things further.Though I didn’t feel as much of a connection with Julia, Natasha's character stood out, offering more depth and relatability compared to the rest of the cast. The plot is well-executed with entertaining locations and high-energy pacing, though it lacks some of the quirky character magic seen in Waxman’s previous works. Despite the shortcomings, the novel’s intriguing setup and engaging dynamics, especially with its exploration of addiction, kept me hooked until the end.Overall, this cozy Hollywood mystery delivers plenty of fun and suspense, making it a perfect light read for fans of Waxman’s witty storytelling.Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for providing me with a digital reviewer copy in exchange for my honest feedback.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter"
Our Last Wild Days,Anna  Bailey,4.01,"Haunting, lyrical, and dripping with Southern gothic atmosphere—Anna Bailey’s Our Last Wild Days completely consumed me.From the moment I stepped into the sweltering, mosquito-bitten swamps of Jackknife, Louisiana, I was hooked. This is not just a thriller—this is a slow-burn character study, a meditation on guilt, grief, and the messy business of making amends.The Labasques aren’t like anyone else in this tight-knit, judgmental town. Outcasts who survive off the land by hunting alligators and selling their meat, they’ve always been treated like misfits raised by wolves—feral, feared, and shunned. But when Cutter Labasque is found face-down in the bayou, her supposed suicide barely raises an eyebrow… except from one person: Loyal May, her estranged childhood friend who once betrayed her.Loyal had escaped this town at eighteen, leaving behind a trail of heartbreak, her eccentric mother, and a version of herself the town refused to accept. She built a life elsewhere, only to return ten years later when her mother, showing early signs of dementia, begins digging up the garden with her bare hands in the middle of the night.Now back in Jackknife, working a thankless job at the local paper, Loyal is assigned to cover a routine case with a phone-obsessed photographer—only to stumble upon Cutter’s body. The sheriff’s department wants it shut and buried. But Loyal can’t accept that—not with the guilt she carries, not with the gnawing instinct that this wasn’t an accident.As she tries to reconnect with Cutter’s brothers—one numbed by addiction, the other menacing and unreadable—Loyal becomes entangled in a dangerous web of corruption, old town secrets, and smoldering resentments. Her pursuit of justice may cost her more than her peace—it could cost her her life.Bailey’s writing is unflinching and atmospheric, painting the oppressive humidity and decay of rural Louisiana with tactile, almost cinematic detail. You feel the rot beneath the surface—of the town, of the politics, and of the people desperately trying to hold themselves together. The characters are deeply flawed, achingly human, and unforgettable. Loyal, in particular, is a brilliant creation—wounded but unyielding, driven by remorse and something close to redemption.This story crawls under your skin like swamp heat—it’s not fast-paced, but it’s relentless. The mystery unravels in unexpected, quietly devastating ways, and the emotional stakes stay razor-sharp.✨ Final thoughts:If you loved Where the Crawdads Sing but wanted something darker, grittier, and more morally complex, Our Last Wild Days will absolutely deliver. This is a heart-wrenching, thought-provoking, stunningly written thriller that explores what it means to be loyal—to your past, to the dead, to your own wounded self.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4.5 rounded up because the writing deserves it!)Endless thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for the digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts. I’ll be thinking about this one for a long time.medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter","Dark, atmospheric, with tension lurking just below the surface, Our Last Wild Days sucked me in and never let go. This book began as a bit of a slow burn for me and I do struggle with them, but the author won me over with her wonderful writing, vivid descriptions, and the mystery surrounding Cutter Labasques's death. I could almost feel the humidity of the swamp, as the family of alligator hunters in Jacknife, Louisiana, went about their business. When Cutter is found face down in the swamp, it is not her brothers but her childhood friend, Loyal May questions Cutter's death. If you are looking for a book that is heavy on emotion with a fantastic southern setting, Our Last Wild Days may be the book for you! You could cut the tension with a knife as this gritty southern book gets closer to the reveal. The story slowly builds and readers soon get to meet several of the key characters who are flawed, damaged, and beaten down. If you struggle with slow burns as I do, hang in there as Anna Bailey will win you over with her searing plot and vivid descriptions. This was my second book by Anna Bailey, and I look forward to reading more of her books in the future. Wonderfully written, atmospheric, and gritty. Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own. Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖","Ughhh so heart wrenching!! Being from a small town, we know the families that deal with addiction, poverty and shunned from the community. This book delivers a message about the labels in place, whether it is troublemakers, outcasts or damaged souls. It has dark underlying tones that are painful to read how neglect and hardships can either make them stronger or angrier. The Labasques family has endured as alligator hunters deep in the Louisiana Bayou. They have known their share of betrayal and have created their own chaos and corruption in the town. When their sister, Cutter, was found dead in the swamp it was as if no one cared, not even her brothers. The one person who did care was her estranged friend, Loyal. Loyal left town at 18 years old after an accident with an alligator and some harsh words that she would regret ever writing for the world to see. Those words were like salt poured deep into the Labasques' wounds. Loyal returned to the town to care for her mom suffering from dementia. She took a job as a journalist at the local newspaper. She arrives in town, as a stranger to many and notes the demise the town has suffered since she left. The dangers are not only in the swamps infested with mosquitoes, alligators and snakes but with the people. The creepy factor is definitely there within the swamps and will have you gravitating to the end. With reminders of Where the Crawdads Sing, just not quite as humbling, because this is a dark atmospheric thriller. A great job by the author keeping it low-key and slowly building riddled implications with 4 POVs, and layers of significance. There is more than meets the surface, and exploring deeper is a worthwhile endeavor. ""How anyone survives is much as it is the mystery of how one woman didn't."" Thank you Netgalley and Atria Books for this incredible ARC in exchange for my honest review."
Bearer of Bad News,Elisabeth Dini,3.82,"A really solid debut, a mix of international intrigue, historical fiction, and mystery. Lucy is blindsided by the betrayal of her fiancé Julian, and wants to move away from town but has a big lease to contend with. She definitely doesn’t want to ask her estranged grandmother, a reclusive retired Oscar winning actress, for any help. She has a gay bestie, Adam, who mostly exists for exposition and for comic relief. Lucy miraculously finds a job listing for a “bearer of bad news,” basically go find my sister and tell her some bad news and I will give you $25,000. Also you get to go to Italy and ski resort country. So there is a truly beautiful setting here, and a fun mystery as we follow Lucy through the Alps trying to find Coco. Her employer, Taffy, is a ridiculous spoiled self centered rich person. Most of the side characters are kind of flat, but this story flows well and is pretty creative plot building. The story jumps back to historical times through a series of letters and documents. I found these sections a bit dry and difficult to follow, but I was eager to get back to the current age. And how cool that debut author has had an entire career as a lawyer prosecuting international crimes. The authenticity of the lost items in world war 2 showed her experience as the plot unfolded. Another fun cozy mystery! Thanks to Gallery Books for the finished copy. #partner #gifted","4.5⭐️ This was not entirely what I was expecting from the cover, but I really enjoyed it! (Spoiler alert: I cried.)RTCThanks S&S Audio for the copy!","A gem of a novel. While it may seem at first glance a lighthearted comedy/mystery about a caper in the Italian Dolomites, this book quickly subverted my expectations with an intricately woven half-century-old tale of heartbreak, resilience, humanity, and what we owe to each other... themes that are particularly relevant today. Not only was the WWII storyline meticulously researched, it's an impressive and ambitious feat of storytelling that spans multiple countries (Germany, Italy, Switzerland) and provides an unflinching look at both the brave and cowardly choices that ordinary people were forced to make in an impossible time. At the same time, thanks to the sharp, voicey writing in the present timeline, we never lost the much-needed levity and witty observations that made for a fun and propulsive read. I am in awe of how the author was able to bring two rich, sweeping timelines together to form a uniquely beautiful and cohesive story.Hoping for a sequel to this terrific book!(Thanks to Gallery Books for the e-ARC)"

My Thoughts
 🧠 °｡⋆˚⁺Er. Ma. Gursh.Miss Jackson you gave me such a heart attack at the end 😭😭😭Here I was like “Dang nothing is happening, this is gonna be a 3 star fs” and then I was screaming, crying, freaking out, and was considering chucking my kindle out the window. There were definitely some things I didn’t like at first, but they for sure grew on me. I’m glad I didn’t dnf because I’m in SHOCK rn bro. Idk what to do with my life now.And the fact that I got to read this months before it came out so I can’t rant to anyone…*depression noises*Though I can’t rant about everything because that would spoil, you’re in for a ride in this review.(also shout out to Ari for listening to all my obsessive rants over facetime as i was freaking out)⁺˚⋆｡° 🛻 
The Plot
 🛻 °｡⋆˚⁺This plot was so good and so well thought out, though it was a little slow at the beginning,Something I loved about it (as dumb as it sounds) is she actually died. They didn’t magically find a cure at the end that no one was expecting. Holly Jackson literally went through with her plot, even though it was heart wrenching, which is what I love in a book.While I didn’t like the fmc I have to say that the characters were so deep and realistic, as well as the setting. It felt like everything was happening real time and I was a part of the story watching it go down. Jackson’s writing is literally amazing.AlsoGUYSBILLY….*swoons* I will get into this more when discussing the characters.But he’s my MANSSSS 🤭Also I need to say thank you for all the Noah Kahan references because that made my heart happy lol.

Instead of being like “oh I’m a pain I should turn my life around” when she was faced with death, she used it to manipulate people into doing what she wanted. On top of that, how freaking hard she had to be hit over the head to be so dumb to not realize that Billy was head over heels for her. I HATED her…but she got slightly better at the end.╰┈> Cynic - Noah Kahan ♫₊˚.➥ Billy: I loved this man. All he wanted to do was be loved back. He didn’t deserve her as she constantly took advantage of and manipulated him, but the fact that he wrote a song for her is what did it for me. He was so sacrificial and just so freaking sweet.

AuffenordePublisher: ScarletPub Date: July 1, 2025Sharing with THE PULSETuscany is gorgeous and the food, people and culture lures tourists every year. I have had the pleasure to see parts of Italy, so I could vision the scenes.This novel is perfect for those who enjoy a Gothic and supernatural element. This is not my normal genre, but I was pleasantly surprised how invested I was in Anna de’ Medici Rossi/s story. As a child Anna lived in a villa in Tuscany, but her childhood was filled with night terrors an her mothers fatal accident. Her mothers accident was suspicious and a precious necklace was missing.Now, she is returning years later as she has inherited the family villa. What will she discover after all this time? Will she find out more about her mothers fate? More about the necklace?Sometimes it is nice to find out about your past, and sometimes things are better not discovered. A beautiful novel full of intrigue, mystery and secrecy. My colleagues and I at Thriller Book Lovers THE PULSE are loving this novel.","Sitting down with this book and a cup of tea I was transported to the world of Tuscany, the villas, the food, the people  the superstitions and beliefs of a world that's steeped in history. Anna knows better than most what this world can do to someone, the way it can turn the world against you on the flip of a coin but still she goes home. Now, did Anna kill her mother during one of her night terrors.... where is that necklace... does Anna know more than she thinks she knows, those were the questions I wanted answers to, and ohh did I get answers. I loved this book, it was full of mystery and suspense, thrilling in it's originality this book kept me glued to it. A solid four-star read for me I'd love to know what you think if you've read it. Thank you to Thriller Book Lovers The Pulse and Daco Auffenorde for providing a copy of this ebook, I have voluntarily read and reviewed it and all thoughts are my own.","Anna returns to her childhood home, haunted by tragedy, whispers of murder, and a cursed necklace. Her search for the truth is slow-burning, psychological, and full of creeping dread.I loved how this book oozes gothic atmosphere—set on a lush Tuscan estate with olive groves, a vineyard, and eerie underground caves. The old villa practically becomes a character itself, hiding secrets and dread behind its stunning facade. I kept questioning whether the supernatural elements were real or just in Anna’s unraveling mind—and honestly, that blurred line made it even better. I loved the moody, haunted vibes!!What I Loved: ✨Unreliable memories & eerie visions ✨Family drama + a tragic legacy ✨Hidden rooms and tunnels, dark history ✨Gorgeous Italian setting with a sinister edgePerfect for fans of dark, character-driven mysteries with supernatural vibes and gothic suspense.

"Good Girl, Bad Blood",Holly  Jackson,4.27,"FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has a truly educational purpose: especially the last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless, and numb. I loved the first book so much, and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my iPad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over-exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving a five-year-old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor, and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audience about the progression of the events and her crime-solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with the series’ name).Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case, who drug-rapped to many girls at the school, including Nat, who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When life turns into its new normal routine, and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing, and his brother Connor, who is also her high school friend, needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea what the 24-year-old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish-netting online sites, and secrets, and Pip finds herself playing a more dangerous game that will bring her to the edge of a tremendous breakdown because this time she took a few more steps to the dark side, and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading, and at the beginning, I thought the first book was a little better, but when I reached the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate went through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times, and the ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, and phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face, and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished, and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast-paced, nail-biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious storytelling. It’s addictive, and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience, Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it, and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","**4.5-stars rounded up**I have been anticipating Good Girl, Bad Blood since I turned the final page of Holly Jackson's 2019-release, A Good Girl's Guide to Murder.Truth be told, I didn't actually know there was going to be a sequel, but I knew I wanted more of Pippa Fitz-Amobi and her badass investigatory skills!After she solved the mystery behind the disappearance of Andie Bell, Pippa created a True Crime podcast about the case, along with her now boyfriend, Ravi Singh.The podcast went viral, but in spite of its huge popularity, Pippa swore off any further investigations.But when her good friend Connor's older brother, Jamie, goes missing, Connor enlists Pippa's help with finding him.Pippa's first suggestion is that Connor go to the police with his concerns. She even goes to speak with them herself, but the officers don't take her seriously. Jamie has disappeared before and they think he has just skipped town for a few days.Pippa can't ignore the signs, however, and they all point to foul play. Against her better judgement, she agrees to look into it. She can't deny a friend in need and sit by while Jamie may be in danger, or worse.As her investigation begins, she unearths a lot of secrets Jamie has been hiding. It's a wicked web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.This was such a fun story. It didn't quite capture me to the extent that A Good Girl's Guide did, but I think that's mostly attributable to first being introduced to Pippa in book one.In the initial book, I loved learning about her as a character. Meeting a girl who was willing to go outside of her comfort zone and risk everything in the name of truth and justice.Pippa definitely felt more mature in this novel, like an old friend. She still has that same fire inside her to discover the truth though. She's really a character you can get behind.The mystery was well-plotted and I absolutely adored the podcast elements incorporated throughout. Podcasts are definitely a popular plot device over the past couple of years and it felt very natural within this story.Holly Jackson has such a pleasing writing style. The setting, format and fantastic characters in these stories will keep me coming back for more as long as she keeps writing them.I cannot wait for the next book in the series!!!","I made a promise. . . . I said I would never do this again, never play the detective, never again lose myself.
Pip has sworn off solving mysteries for good. Now she's just following the trials from her one and only bout of sleuthing and updating her podcast with all the latest developments. But when a friend goes missing and the police refuses to do anything, Pip knows she'll have to step up again, even if it costs her everything.Sometimes I read a book, and it so far exceeds my expectations that I wonder afterwards if maybe I'd hallucinated. That's how I felt about the first book in this series. It was young adult, yet it was so smart, sharp, gritty, and utterly unputdownable. Now that I've read book 2, I know it wasn't just a fluke because it yet again exceeded all my expectations.I'm one of those people who grew up reading Nancy Drew (and The Hardy Boys, of course, but Nancy was my main jam). And so I'm always on the lookout, hoping some new, smart, spunky teen detective would pick up the mantle and delight me once again. And I've found exactly that in Pip.One of my favorite things about this series is the way the investigation unfolds. Clues are collected and followed up, which then leads to the next set of steps and clues. It's all very logical. And the dossier format of interviews, articles, maps, notes, etc. is so masterfully done that it feels like I'm in the middle of a real investigation.Just a word of warning: this isn't one of those mystery series you can read in any order you'd like. This book contains crucial information on the resolution of book 1, something I'm very thankful for because I have absolutely terrible book-memory. But it means you must read the books in order or risk being completely spoiled.As I'm getting older, I've noticed that I'm slowly outgrowing YA, but this series still speaks to me. Its mysteries and the way they expose the darkness of human nature, but also its cleverness and resourcefulness through its teen detective, appeals to all ages. I cannot wait for book 3!~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1. A Good Girl's Guide to Murder#3. As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
The Guest List,Lucy Foley,3.80,"Hell yeah! My choice for best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I usually hate two things in my readings:	1.	Too many POVs: I get confused easily and don’t like having to go back to remember which character was the postman who rang twice or which character had some irrelevant backstory, blah blah, unnecessary yada yada.	2.	Slow-burning storytelling: I’m an impatient person. I like to go straight to the point and cut to the chase. I don’t like stalling around facts; I just like to dive in!BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow-building tension. I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys’ club (I’m talking about the groom’s friends who act like wedding crashers and have never outgrown their teenage years). I loved the variety of interesting, rich, attention-grabbing characters. And the wonderful part is that until the end of the book, we are left in the dark with no idea who is dead or the identity of the perpetrator.You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail can turn out to be a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and avoid being shocked by the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that, but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out, and I stayed in this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams had finally come true and I had turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I wasn’t human and left some gifts on my head (yes, I washed it ten times). But when I got over my initial shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, a successful, glamorous, and overly ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from anger management issues, selfish, perfectionistic, controlling, and the worst bridezilla, marries Will, a charming, rising star of television, cocky and flirtatious, on an island off the coast of Ireland. It’s in the middle of nowhere, with limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes with dark woods and caves, making you feel like somebody is sneaking up behind you. (Perfect place for a low-budget independent horror movie, but not an ideal wedding location. Bridezilla doesn’t care; she knows best!)Our other characters: Helen (plus one) is married to the bride’s oldest and best male friend, Charlie. She has doubts about their intense and secluded relationship, is a mother, a graphic designer on long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, has her own secrets, and befriends bridesmaid Olivia.Yes, Olivia is a 19-year-old bridesmaid, half-sister of the bridezilla, suffering from a big secret that makes her lose weight and cut herself. The secret is gnawing at her. She needs to talk to someone before she hurts herself. Could Helen be her confidante?Best man Johnno seems confused about what he’s doing with his life. He shares a really big secret with Will from their high school days, giving him nightmares and making him feel like he’s being chased by ghosts from the past. And he learns something crucial that changes his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous…Let’s not forget Aoife, the wedding planner, working tirelessly to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job. But she observes everyone, looking agitated, as if she’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about?The lies, secrets, resentments, and big revelations start to fall into her lap like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony, the lights go out, there are screams, pitch black, the lights come back on, somebody is dead… na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed whom?Guess what, I’ve already told you so much, you’ve got to read the rest of it.I hate to admit it, but I am not a fan of “The Hunting Party.” That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good. I couldn’t decide whether to give it 4 or 5 stars. I decided on 4 slow-burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!OVERALL: SURPRISINGLY ENJOYABLE!","This book should be renamed The Never. Ever. Ending. Wedding.Sorry friends who loved and praised this one! It was a perfectly fine book, and it has all the right ingredients for a good murder mystery whodunnit - creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere, multiple suspects with motive to kill, loads of secrets threatening to be revealed, and five intriguing narrators to move the story along, all wrapped up in a big festive occasion.What’s not to love?Well, for starters, the characters. You have Jules, the bride: an attractive, ambitious publisher of online magazine, The Download, whose driven, always aware of the optics, self-centered personality bores me. Next up Will, the groom: an exceedingly attractive, self-assured TV star with enough plastered-on humblebrag charm to get his way on just about anything. Add to the mix Charlie, Jules’ best mate, who goes from mild-mannered school teacher to obnoxious turd in the course of one weekend, his wife Hannah, an ex-party girl turned good wife/mom who seems tempted by every hot guy/girl at the wedding, Jules’ half-sister Olivia, who is just an unstable hot mess, and a hodge-podge of a**hole groomsmen/ushers - Johnno, Duncan, Femi, Pete, and Angus - school friends of Will’s who were toxic bullies as children who grew into drunk toxic bullies as adults.These are miserable people. Miserable people aren’t fun to read about. Even Mother Nature herself looked at these people and cried miserable gales of gloomy tears at the wedding.The other thing that didn’t sit well for me was simply the utter convenience and unbelievability of the plot and how some of these characters were connected to the murder victim. It didn’t elicit that “OMG, I didn’t see that coming!” Rather, for me, it just elicited eye-rolls. On top of that, it took forever to reveal the murder victim, due to the time jump, rotating narrators style of the chapters. I understand this is to build intrigue and suspense - good mysteries do that - but since I didn’t like any of the characters, by the time the victim was revealed, I just didn’t really care.I’m sure coming off two very uplifting, lighthearted reads affected my overall feelings about this book, which was so moody and depressing by comparison, so I’ll blame the timing for some of this. That said, although it’s a perfectly good book, I’m just not sure I understand the hype. ★★ 1/2","Whenever I come across a murder mystery on an island, I just can't resist. The setting is positively atmospheric and who doesn't love a good locked-island mystery? There's something immensely appealing about a small group of people being stuck together with no escape while knowing that a murderer is among them.(And it takes place at a wedding! I love weddings!)So I put on my detective hat and get ready to puzzle this out, with much glee. But here is the first problem: not only do we not know the murderer, we don't know who the victim is either. So right off the bat, some of the fun is taken out of the whole thing.The story also suffers from a few other issues that seem to plague most books of this genre. The characters are, unfortunately, all unlikable and dumb. They have trouble saying simple things to each other that would clear up much confusion. They make mistake after mistake, and then ruminate at length about each. And they all drink themselves into stupors at the first sign of discomfort, instead of just... talking.There is so much buildup for this story. For 200+ pages, we are treated to nothing but petty drama between all the participants. There is a constant feeling of anticipation and foreboding, as if something bad is going to happen, but nothing actually does. It was exhausting. And when we finally get to the good stuff, the twists are fine, but they weren't surprising. I figured this was the direction the story was going, and it indeed went there. Overall, it was a passable way to spend a few hours, but it doesn't quite rise above all the other modern thrillers in this over-saturated genre. It's just if you're going to build up an entire story on nothing but anticipation and petty drama, when it finally gets to the payoff, it better blow me away. And this just didn't.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Hunting PartyThe Paris Apartment~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
Such Quiet Girls,Noelle W. Ihli,4.00,"4.5* Not me SOBBING at that ending 😭😭 PHEW this was a harrowing, heart-pumping, and completely gripping story inspired by true events (that I’m absolutely about to deep-dive into and learn all about!!) Highly recommend this one. Noelle is not an author to sleep on.","3.75 Stars ₊⊹⁀➴ A bus full of kids disappears and only one mother gets a ransom. One girl kind of takes charge as the bus driver is kind of frozen. One of the kidnappers starts to have second thoughts. Will these kids get out?I also heard it's based on a true story! I didn’t look it up to confirm though. So lemme just say lol it’s been an extremely hectic week for me with all kinds of stress going on so it took me a little while longer than it normally would to finish this book.I mention my stress because this story deals with hostages being held in a confined space to the point that not having oxygen is a real threat.I’ve never really considered myself as claustrophobic (at least not on a severe level) but omg the small space in this book coupled with my own anxiety that I have going on, made for a real interesting experience. 😅The pacing is great in this one, it moves along quickly, with multiple point of views covering a lot of ground in around 350 pages? Can’t find the pg count so that’s a guestimate. I wasn’t a big fan of any of the characters in this one really lol not until the end at least. The end did have me tearing up. Solid thriller- extra horrifying if you don’t like small spaces and or are a mother.

The Paris Apartment,Lucy Foley,3.65,"Meh. The Paris Apartment feels mostly like melodramatic dithering, but I guess I was somewhat entertained.Jess needs a place to stay, so she hits up her half brother. When she arrives at his residence, she finds a fancy building with questionable tenants, but no sign of Ben. As she digs deeper and asks around, she starts to realize that all is not as it seems at this apartment building. Dun dun dun!Having read a few of Lucy Foley's books, I feel like she's really good at building up anticipation. Every moment in this book is so dramatic, with dark shadows and scary sounds at every turn. That's all good, but after a while, it gets to be a bit much, you know? There's no natural ebb and flow in the tone. It's just all high anticipation, all the time.It doesn't help that every character acts so high-strung and paranoid, even when nothing is happening.
I watched as Nick's friend plucked a sprig of rosemary from one of the bushes, tearing hard to wrench it free. How he crushed it to his nose, inhaled. There was something presumptuous about the gesture. It felt like an act of vandalism.
What the heck. Who attacks a bush just to smell it? And who watches someone do that and calls it ""presumptuous""? Reader, if you're able to keep from rolling your eyes, you're a better person than I am.For a book advertised as a mystery, it sure doesn't feel like one. Jess doesn't so much suss out clues as she bumbles around, pilfering stuff, sticking her foot in her mouth, and just generally acts like an incompetent idiot. The other characters are all unlikable too, though each in their own way. And everyone is smelly, with stale breath and excessive sweat.After all that exaggerated writing, do the twists deliver? Eh, they seem pretty standard to me for the genre. I wasn't really surprised or shocked. In fact, it feels more ridiculous than anything else.Still, I was compelled to turn the pages, so I must've been somewhat entertained by all the antics.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Guest ListThe Hunting Party~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","Quoi le? (According to Google Translate What the....?"")Jess arrives in Paris at the apartment of her half-brother, Ben. However, Ben isn't answering any of her texts, is nowhere to be found, and there are some unsettling discoveries in the apartment. Will Jess be able to find out what happened to Ben? What went on in this apartment?Lucy Foley, author of The Guest List, returns to the literary scene with The Paris Apartment. The book rotates between different character points of view with chapters from Ben, Jess, Sophie, the Concierge, Mimi, and Nick. The Paris Apartment starts off very strong with Jess finding her brother missing. The tone is immediately spooky and frenzied. However, it became really old, really fast with the frenzied tone. It doesn't feel as if Jess is making much progress finding answers, and the tension never really builds throughout the book. Additionally, I didn't connect with any of the characters because there wasn't a single character that was likeable. By the end of the novel, I didn't even care ""who did it."" Jess should have been the most likeable character, but she was always stealing, palming items from other people, even her own brother, and going through people's personal spaces without any qualms.Overall, The Paris Apartment missed the mark (unless you enjoy books with little substance and a spooky, frenzied tone is utilized throughout).2025 Reading ScheduleJan	A Town Like AliceFeb	BirdsongMar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr	War and PeaceMay	The Woman in WhiteJun	AtonementJul	The Shadow of the WindAug	Jude the ObscureSep	UlyssesOct	Vanity FairNov	A Fine BalanceDec	GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango","What a deliciously claustrophobic whodunnit! This mystery unfolds in an eerie apartment with terrifying occupants who are skilled liars, burying their ugly secrets. Even the city of lovers, Paris, feels transformed, harking back to its revolutionary years with civilians rising against the government and clashing with police officers. Paris itself becomes a vivid, complex, and tumultuous narrator in the story.This was one of my fastest reads! I loved the riveting mystery of the missing stepbrother, Ben, who vanished into thin air, with the last place he was seen being his apartment.I loved Jess as the main character—survivor of the foster care system, running from her haunted past. She’s broken but resilient, mostly reckless, a woman who has nothing to lose!I also loved the strange connection between the irritating occupants who know exactly where Ben is but have no intention of sharing their knowledge with his stepsister.I liked the creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension, the short and effective chapters, and the eccentric voices of the multiple POVs.I also enjoyed the final twist, even though some parts of the conclusion made me roll my eyes. It was a somewhat fair ending, one that the characters truly deserved.So, I’m rounding up 4.5 stars to 5 for this riveting, truly exciting, twisty, unputdownable read!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
A Flicker in the Dark,Stacy Willingham,3.98,"I almost always give even the shittiest books at least two stars because the author I'm bashing wrote words and got them published. Good job. However, given that the story has already been optioned by Emma Stone, I don't think the author will be weeping into her labradoodle's fur over my piddly little review. So, fuck it. ONE STAR.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD""Psychology,"" I said. ""I'm hoping to pursue my PhD here next fall - then, eventually get my master's."" Reader, my eyes closed in pain. I'd like to call this an editorial error, but I think the main character is actually this stupid. I have a master's degree. I also have a doctorate. Which one do you think came first - the doctor designation, or the dusty, useless piece of paper my mom put in a frame? Hmm.Where to even start with this book? Chloe Davis, the human equivalent of hold music, is very deeply damaged. She's the daughter of a notorious serial killer, and she's done everything she can to separate herself from that life. Those efforts include the following: not changing her name, moving an hour away from her hometown, giving an interview on how her serial killer father inspired her career, ETC. Girlfriend, have you heard of Google? Everybody knows you. Your Ken-doll fiancé - yeah, you didn't have to reveal nothing, because other people know how the internet works.Yep, let's discuss Ken-doll: he throws you surprise parties even though he knows you freak out about everything. He unilaterally decides to throw in a little surprise choking during some nice, relaxing morning sex. (Didn't your father's victims die by choking? Huh. Tacky). Dude disappears all the time and you never really bother to ask where he is or what he's doing. Sounds super great. A nice healthy relationship. At least you can call in prescriptions in his name! (Apparently psychologists can do that in Louisiana --solidifying the decision to set the book here, because this girl would have never made it through medical school).Elevator music drug and alcohol problem: Look, I realize I'm more Hunter S. Thompson than most, but this D & A problem ain't really that bad. I work with lawyers and criminal defendants, and ALL of us are taking benzos legally or illegally and in much higher quantities than Princess Chloe here. You're worried ONE xanax is going to muck up your day? If you're really an addict, you'd have to take half the bottle to even notice you took anything. Two glasses of wine after a xanax, and you wake up not remembering what happened? Two xanax and you lose a DAY AND A HALF? This is some amateur shit right here. Our girl talks about having done all of this since college (10-12 years?) -- this is your tolerance? LEAVE THIS PARTY RIGHT NOW. Some other random thoughts: they find Valium in the first victim's hair follicles approximately two seconds after they find the body. What coroner on what earth is looking at a hair follicle test first thing? Those things take days to process in a best case scenario. They would use a blood test, a vitreous fluid test, maybe even a urine test if there was any remaining. I've sat through enough expert witness testimony to feel personally affronted by this scene. This inattention to detail covered the entire book. I understand we don't all need to know the science. But if you don't have the science, you need the characters. Ergo, if there is neither science nor character, you have a fucking snoozer, my friends. Who even needs the Xanax at this point. SHE SLEEPS WITH THE FAKE REPORTER MURDERER. God! Was the choking the day before not enough? Also, there was chocolate on a pillow at a Motel 6? Laugh out loud. This is like Blair from ""Gossip Girl"" trying to write ""poor.""Then, revelation time. Chloe has solved this puzzle! The dang murderer is obviously taking these girls to Chloe's childhood home. She also apparently used to know him, because he's from her home town. EYE ROLL. She is going to drive right to the house and not tell anyone about it. She is also going to leave her phone in the car because why would you need that? (Aside: a famous serial killer's house has been sitting empty for 20 years and it's somehow completely intact, not vandalized, burned down...?) In what world?Well, thankfully Dr. Brilliant Chloe remembers to take the gun into the house, even though she's never shot a gun in her life. Earlier in the book, she even rues the fact. ""Golly gee, I should really learn to shoot this thing."" But, in this perfect moment, the benzos have steadied her hands, and she shoots that dumb fucker reporter lover murderer right in the fatal spot. Deus ex 9mm.But, of course that's not the end, because the killer from 20 years ago was Chloe's weirdo brother. Did that surprise a single person who read this? The serial killer sitting in jail never actually did it, duh. Turns out those porno mags Cooper kept in his room really pushed him over the edge. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE. Cooper feels the darkness, he says. Yeah, dude. We all feel the fucking darkness. Take this bottle of xanax and work it out.The ending is Chloe arriving at her former(?) fiancé's sister's house. She drove to Mississippi to return the ring (certified mail anyone?), but she doesn't actually want to talk to Ken-doll. In retrospect, and aside from not asking permission for the choking, he wasn't so bad. He's a pharmaceutical rep and she's a drug ""addict."" Match made in heaven, DUH.Chloe's dad gets out of jail because, also, DUH. My only emotional response to that was that everyone should watch the show Rectify and forget they read this stupid fucking book. If my kid was murdering people, you better believe I wouldn't take a murder rap for that little psycho! Emma Stone, my beautiful, husky-voiced girlfriend: I love you, but this book is not your ""Sharp Objects.""","Even though A Flicker in the Dark has an interesting premise, its reliance on the confused and drugged-up female narrator trope prevented this story from being as great as it could've been.Chloe Davis has lived in the shadow of fear for a long time. When she was twelve years ago, six teenage girls disappeared in town, one right after another. The nightmare finally ended when her own father confessed to the killings, upending her childhood and leaving her family in ruins. Now twenty years later, girls are going missing again. And Chloe can't help but feel there is a link between what's happening now and what happened so long ago.I've read plenty of serial killer stories from the perspective of investigators, the victims and their families, and regular townspeople, but I'm not sure I've ever read one from the killer's own daughter. And coming at it from that angle makes this story feel fresh and unusual. Chloe still suffers from the fallout of her childhood, and her narrative envelopes the whole story in her dark and foreboding mood.Where this didn't quite work as well for me is the pacing. It's very slow, with hardly anything happening in the first 250 pages. Instead, we spend a lot of time in Chloe's head as she ruminates, freaks out, consumes copious quantities of alcohol and prescription drugs, sticks her nose where it doesn't belong, and in general, just bumbles around being confused and paranoid. To be fair, this is a pretty common trope for the genre, but it just isn't my favorite as I find it to be pretty dull and a bit exasperating.Clearly, this is the sort of psychological thriller that leans heavily towards the psychological side, whereas I like mine to be more on the thriller side. I always enjoy a more active investigation instead of a more active rumination. However, that's just a personal preference. I think a lot of what I found to be slow is what a lot of readers find fascinating, so your experiences may be the opposite of mine.The pacing does finally pick up in the last 100 pages, and we are treated to one revelation after another. I wouldn't necessarily say any of it is surprising (I've read too many thrillers at this point), but it is exciting. The way everything comes together is really the highlight of the book, and made this a worthwhile read for me.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

One in Four,Lucinda Berry,3.43,"I’m a huge Lucinda Berry fan, so I was super excited to start this book. The first few chapters were great—I was hooked!But then... things took a turn. The story suddenly changed so much, I had to double-check if I was still reading the same book!It wasn’t all bad. Once I got back into it, it was okay. But I struggled to connect with the characters, which made it a bit hard to fully enjoy.A solid 3 stars from me.","A complex, heartrending plot, One in Four was the epitome of a Lucinda Berry story. You see, it was dark, gritty, and twisted in that deeply psychological way she’s so well known for exploring. So it was no great surprise that from the slow burn start until the delicious unhinged conclusion, I couldn’t put this one down no matter how late into the night I found myself compulsively reading. After all, just when I thought I had it all figured out, a twist would arrive on the scene and destroyed whatever surprise I thought I saw coming. To be frank, describing this book as twisty is quite the understatement as the revelations were downright mind-blowing in all of their unguessable albeit somewhat over-the-top glory. I do have to warn you, however, when I said that this book was dark, I really meant it. Addressing some disturbingly serious topics, it explored not only addiction and trauma, but also a handful of other spine-chilling themes. I can’t delve into those, though, without providing one heck of a spoiler. Just be sure to check out my list of triggers before diving in if so inclined. After all, this one had me crawling out of my skin by the time I reached the last page. I just wish there had been a more detailed and less abrupt ending. Somewhat open-ended, it had me wishing for a nice, pretty, little bow to match up with the rest of this riveting novel.All said and done, between the dual timelines and mysterious second perspective, I was wholly won over by this unputdownable thriller. At under 250 pages, the panic-inducing storyline, suspicious personas, and sinister feel had me flying through the pages despite the late hour. I mean, who could pass up an addiction counselor protagonist paired with a revenge plot for the ages. Feeling psychologically acute as well as completely unnerving, Berry knew just how to tighten the screws as she delivered an entirely plausible yet delightfully unhinged ending. So if you love a relevant story that will make think long and hard, give this one a try. Just be sure to cancel all plans as you won’t be able to put it down. Rating of 4 stars.SYNOPSIS:Dr. Laurel Harlow can’t believe she’s agreed to do a reality TV show. But her years as a chemical dependency counselor and personal history with the show’s director make her the obvious choice.

The Reappearance of Rachel Price,Holly  Jackson,4.09,"★ 3.25 stars The Reappearance of Rachel Price revolves around Annabel “Bel” Price — a young girl whose mother, Rachel, vanished without a trace 16 years ago and nobody knows what happened to her. Bel was the sole witness and she could’ve been the one with answers as she was with Rachel when she disappeared, but she was too young to have any recollection of anything so it remained a mystery to everyone, including herself. when a documentary about Rachel’s disappearance is being made, she suddenly reappears leaving everyone shocked. Bel should be relieved that her mom is back and surprisingly alive, but she has a gut feeling that something is wrong and she suspects that Rachel is not telling the truth about where she was all those years.it’s for sure an interesting and intriguing premise written by the one and only ✨ Holly Jackson ✨ and that’s why my expectations were extremely high. however, this story didn’t quite live up to my expectations and, unfortunately, i ended up feeling kind of disappointed. *this review will be somewhat all over the place because i personally feel like i couldn’t gather my thoughts properly, so please bear with me.first of all, let’s talk about the protagonist: Annabel Price.i don’t like reading books where the main character is too perfect, too nice and doesn’t have any flaws. that’s boring to me. i prefer to read books with main characters that are imperfect and have flaws because that makes them realistic and easy to relate with. Bel checks all the boxes (sort of); she is not perfect, she is flawed and, in some way, she is relatable. on top of that, she is also sarcastic, headstrong, cynical and sharp tongued, which are things that i truly enjoy to see in a female protagonist because it can be entertaining. however, it was not entertaining here, not at all. it was actually unpleasant. for the majority of the book, Bel was an extremely unlikeable, selfish, disrespectful and arrogant character. i think there’s a huge difference between being a headstrong person who’s not afraid of speak their mind and being an annoying person who’s just plainly rude to everyone, even to those that don’t deserve. having a strong personality has nothing to do with being rude or disrespectful, let’s keep that in mind. sure, Bel had traumas that made her be the way she is and act the way she does and i can’t blame her for that, but i personally don’t think it justify some of her actions, sorry. don’t get me wrong, i’m not saying she’s the most terrible character out there, because she is not. she was... tolerable and funny at times, i’ll admit. but in general, i was just not particularly fond of Bel and her personality, which made it difficult for me to deeply connect with her and really understand her. Bel’s character could’ve been written better and a bit differently.the only characters i liked to an extent were Rachel & Ash (still bummed that he barely appeared). i felt pretty indifferent about the others. and let’s be honest, most of them weren’t even that likeable to begin with.as i said earlier, the premise of this book is interesting and intriguing, there’s no doubt about it. but the execution? eh, definitely not perfect.the story started off great and very promising. at the beginning, i was truly believing that this had potential to be a five star read as i was absolutely loving it and having the highest of hopes for the rest of the book. now, looking back, i realize how delusional i was. not 100 pages in and i was already thinking i would rate this book five stars... a bit early to make that assumption, isn’t it? yeah, i’m aware. but that shows how much i trust Holly Jackson (or used to trust, at least).as i got further into the story, i realized that this book, in fact, did not deserve a five star rating.i am not saying i didn’t enjoy reading this, i would be a liar if i said that — even with its flaws, this managed to keep me hooked from beginning to end and i did like some aspects of it, but obviously, i disliked others. like i said earlier, i didn’t like Bel; disliking the protagonist is the major problem for obvious reasons. but Bel was not the only problem here, i also had issues with other things that largely prevented me from giving this novel a higher rating.━ ‼ hidden spoilers below. don’t click on them if you haven’t read the book yet.↳ 1. i wasn’t a fan of the way Holly handled Bel and Rachel’s relationship. the thing that bothered me the most is that Bel immediately starts distrusting Rachel as soon as she returns, she doesn’t even try to show some empathy to the woman who birthed her which is... strange. listen, i’m not saying she was wrong for being suspicious and wanting to know what happened and everything else, but the way Bel reacted was not the most realistic portrayal of a daughter who was seeing her mother for the first time after 16 years. it didn’t make sense to me, honestly. i thought they would at least build a relationship and then the suspicions would start, but no, that’s not what happens. unrealistic to say the least. and let’s be honest, Bel’s immediate distrust is kind of a spoiler that Rachel is definitely not guilty because that’s how thrillers work — the suspect from the beginning of the book is never (or almost never) the one who is actually guilty, it’s just the way it works. that’s the reason why i never suspected her, even though we are “forced” to do that.↳ 2. most of the plot twists were sort of easy to predict for me and they weren’t as mind-blowing as i thought they would be.  as i mentioned above, it’s no hard to guess that Rachel was not guilty, so that means the suspect is another character and you have to use your brain and make your own theories. in the first half, i came up with this theory that Charlie was behind everything. how? well, i thought “what character would shock the reader the most?” and done, i had my answer: Charlie. see? not hard. i also had this brief thought that Carter was Rachel’s daughter — though i thought i was wrong and i didn’t fully believe it would make a lot of sense, but turns out i was right about that too. needless to say, i was not very shocked by these twists. now, the grandfather’s involvement and the fact that Charlie sent him to kill Rachel were the only things i wasn’t able to guess, so at least there’s that. thankfully. that truly caught me off guard and genuinely shocked me. generally speaking, the twists, while predictable for me, weren’t necessarily bad. but the author should’ve worked a bit harder to deliver more insane and crazy twists and turns.↳ 3. a few things that happened in this book were not realistic at all. some stuff that happened were just too hard to believe. like for example: the conclusion. i just couldn’t get past how unrealistic the whole thing was and i can't really say it left me satisfied. it’s not news that Holly’s books require suspension of belief and i personally never had a problem with that (sometimes all we need is to turn off our brains and have a little fun), but this time i have to admit that i got a bit bothered.↳ 4. the writing was repetitive every so often. i literally lost count of how many times the knot in Bel’s gut was mentioned. what was the point of mentioning that every two seconds? ↳ 5. the pacing was super slow in the middle and the storyline became repetitive. not a lot of relevant or interesting stuff was happening which made me come to the conclusion that this book didn’t need to be over 400 pages long, completely unnecessary in my view. it could’ve easily been 100-150 pages shorter and i stand by that.fortunately, the pacing picked up towards the end; more specifically, in the last 25% and i liked that. the amount of things happening made me feel invested and i couldn’t put the book down for the life of me, literally finished in one sitting.aside from all the flaws, i still could enjoy this book. as i mentioned, i was hooked from beginning to end so, overall, i can’t say i regret reading it. but of course, i expected much more from it and perhaps it’s my partially fault for having over the top expectations — but i also think that Holly Jackson could’ve delivered something far more better. i’m the biggest enthusiast of the AGGGTM series and it hurts to say that her new books (this one and Five Survive) weren’t capable me of giving the same feels. such a letdown...all in all, The Reappearance of Rachel Price didn’t live up to its full potential and might not be one of the greatest thrillers i’ve ever read, but it’s not a terrible story and it has its entertaining and enjoyable parts. i believe (or rather hope) that other people might like it way more than i did so of course i recommend it to anyone. just don’t expect something as a amazing as the A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder series (like i did) and you won’t be disappointed.─────────────────────﹙ ➷ pre–read: ﹚i haven’t had a single 5 star read yet this year 
(*cries*)
 but i feel like this will be the one because in holly jackson we trust! 🤭 i’m just SO excited to read it. <3","4.45!
So much happened. Expectations were high, some were met, some were not but all in all, it was a splendid experience that I know I will want to experience once again.It is honestly something in the way that Holly writes because there is no way that I could read a book by her and not feel hooked, not feel like I have to let go of all my other reads just to finish this one. Her style of writing, her way with words are beautiful and immersive, from the moment that I read the first page I knew this was going to be a wild ride and I was not proven wrong. I swear to god if I had time, I would have read it in one sitting but even when I was not reading it and was occupied with work, this book never failed to leave my mind, it was literally etched into it. Holly Jacksons writing style is so atmospheric, suspenseful, compelling and captivating.Annabel Price (bel) our main character through whom we experience the whole book was a pleasure to read because let me tell you there is not one character that has made me laugh, feel sad, happy and frustrated at the same time, She was so witty and smart and I loved how all the snarky retorts were at the tip of her tongue and how she spoke back because we do not see that happen in many books and I hate characters who can not stand up for themselves luckily that was not the case for Bel. Holly has the magic of writing flawed and complex characters so well and she does not hold back any chance she gets to wield it because there were so many layers to Bel's character and just so much depth. I honestly felt Bel and because she was written in such an intricate way I saw how much frustrating it must have been for her.The plot was so well webbed and I honestly believe that authors of this genre should be praised so highly because it is not easy at all to write a plot line that engages readers, keeps them on their toes while simultaneously foreshadowing and throwing things around things which make so much sense and the fact that they have the brain to throw us off completely from what is happening and prove our theories wrong again and again is just straight up amazing, because I can write a romance and a fantasy novel but I could never write a thriller. Moving back, Under these well placed layers of clues, interviews, documentary and notes I found so much enjoyment. I experienced the sudden epiphany of unveiling the clues that were thrown at us and at times I stopped doing my work just to sit and read this. It was so well thought and so well placed. The only reason why I am not giving this a 5 is because I somewhat predicted one of the main twists which instead of giving me satisfaction, made me feel underwhelmed but I was thrown off once again with another twist that I did not see coming but should have.Note: There is very minimal romance, much less than AGGTM and we do get crumbs and nice moments with banter but it is definitely not the main focus and is overshadows but the development and twists.
SPOILERS AHEAD!!
I cant talk about these two characters without spoiling it for others.Rachel Price, from the moment she was introduced I knew she was innocent and had been wronged, there was someone after her and at first tbh I did not expect it to be Charlie but rather the stalker but as the story progressed and things started to unravel I went like FUCK YEAH IT IS HIM but technically I was wrong since the grandpa was the one who kidnapped her but the father was the one who orchestrated it all and truth be told the moment I heard him say ""works tough"" I knew he was lying and he had a role to play and I was RIGHT but OH MY GOD that Carter twist was so unexpected MY EYES WERE WIDE and I GASPED so loud.
 SPOILERS END
Overall, I had the best time with this book and would definitely recommend it to everyone! y'all have to experience this.*Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Children's publishing for this arc in exchange for an honest review.*",Holly Jackson does it again! I loveddd the ending of this book. It was so fast-paced and I didn't see it coming. Also the concept of Rachel Price disappearing and then reappearing had me hooked! The only 2 things I disliked that stopped it from being 5 stars for me:1. The first half moved a bit slow and then the end moved so fast. I wish the pacing was a little more consistent and we got more concrete clues in the beginning.2. I didn't really bond with Bel in the way I've bonded with Holly Jackson's other main characters like Pip. That could just be a personal thing as everyone is different and will relate to different characters. But Bel felt a little one-dimensional to me. Other than that a great mystery! Definitely made me want to read more mysteries this year.
The Maid,Nita Prose,3.75,"Now a Goodreads Choice Nominee in Mystery & Thriller and Debut Novel
 🤨Mmmmmm yeah, no. This was not good. I did not enjoy it at all, and I recommend it to nobody. Okay that’s the review, bye!!!!!Lol yeah, maybe one day I’ll be the person who can just rate and move on but today is not that day! And I am not that guy.As of now, I can see I am in the minority opinion. It wasn’t far into The Maid before I realized this wasn’t going to be a positive experience for me. But I’d like to give a shout out to Jan B’s review for bringing up a lot of things I was thinking while reading, and to Chelsea who lets me complain to her uninhibited. As a BOTM pick, a book slated for adaptation and an author who is a publishing executive, this one’s gonna have a lot of eyes on it, and I want to make sure there are perspectives present beyond the flurry of glowing reviews.The premise of The Maid is such: a hotel maid who is “different” from other people discovers the dead body of one of the hotel’s wealthiest patrons, foul play suspected. She gets further dragged into the fray and unintentionally incriminates herself, all while misreading what should be “obvious” social cues. There’s murder, money, drugs, off-page violence and ~mystery~ all wrapped in something meant to be somewhere between a cozy mystery and a genre thriller. The plot itself is fine, though nothing we haven’t seen before. Instead, what’s carrying the story is the titular Molly the Maid, set up as a lovable underdog that just gets in over her head. She works hard! She is a good person! She tries her best! And she LOOOOOVES to clean!!!!!!! Clearly this is meant to be cute and charming.But Molly is also written as neurodivergent in some never-specified way. I’ve seen a couple of weird arguments by people saying the author has not confirmed this, but she doesn’t have to. I read it; the writing is not exactly subtle. And I did not love the way she was depicted at all, to be totally honest. I can only guess that Nita Prose was trying to capitalize on that ‘quirky female main character who whoopsie-daisies her way into some trouble’ trend from like 5ish years ago. And frankly, she missed the boat. This isn’t a fresh, compelling character idea—and in the case of The Maid, it wasn’t even well done.Listen, I understand the intent behind a character like this. I’m not saying it’s necessarily offensive, but it sure as hell isn’t cute. And the idea of a gaggle of privileged, upper-middle class book club women reading and gigging at a character like Molly being framed for murder because she ‘doesn’t understand how people work’ makes me feel kind of weird. Molly appears as a caricature, dreamed up by someone who’s only exposure to ND people has been Rain Man and Eleanor Oliphant. As others have noted, Molly’s qualities aren’t very consistent. They wax and wane depending on the need of the story. She doesn’t understand what a rumba is or can’t tell if someone is smiling or not, but then is effectively spouting off complex behavioral analysis a few chapters later. The situations she finds herself in are beyond ludicrous, and the way she inevitably gets out of them even more ridiculous. And Molly isn’t the exception to bad characterizations. Every single other person, from the villain(s), to the fumbling police, to the rest of the hotel staff—are all cartoonishly portrayed. There’s probably more subtext I’m missing, with the two additional POC maids and the undocumented kitchen employee (I’m sorry, where is this supposed to take place again? The UK?? Is there a large number of undocumented Mexican immigrants working at British hotels that I’m unaware of???). Because this book isn’t about the challenges of operating in a neurotypical world or the difficulties of navigating a new country while undocumented, but instead those are just secondary stumbling blocks on the road to figure out who murdered this rich white guy. And I don’t feel as though Molly and Juan Manuel were treated with care, but instead a kind of passive cruelty.That said, the biggest offense for me though? This was boring as hell. I couldn’t read more than a dozen or so pages at a time, despite how short it was. I have genuinely no idea how or who chooses which mystery/thrillers to acquire, let alone adapt, but they need to have the company checkbook taken away immediately. Anything present in the story that was out of the ordinary was equal parts absurd and dumb, and anything remotely passable has been done a thousand times already. Seriously someone, anyone, clue me in to what was so compelling about this meditation on why ‘ummm service workers actually LOVE cleaning and waiting on our every whim?!’ with a side helping of murder. I’m literally begging you. I’ll refrain from ending spoilers even though I don’t think it’s worth reading, but that big ‘twist’ was so obvious while also being completely unnecessary. It cheapened every bit of plot up to that point, though by then it was mostly a lost cause for me. one additional note: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ASSISTED SUICIDE ““TWIST””?!? EXCUSE ME.Anyways, someone please call Florence Pugh’s agent and have her pull out of this ASAP. I’m having war flashbacks of Maddie Ziegler and Kate Hudson in Sia’s MUSIC. 😐*Thanks to Random House - Ballantine for the advance review copy!**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!","My brain is still having an argument with itself about this book. Emily1: How is it no one in this book thought ""hey, maybe Molly is acting so 'strange' because she's neurodivergent?""Emily2: Could she not be neurodivergent? Maybe she just has some severe social issues. The author called her ""socially-awkward"" in an interview.Emily1: Oh, please. She reads like someone googled ""signs of autism"".Emily2: Maybe the author doesn't know these suggest autism. YOU didn't for a long time.Emily1: *shifty eyes* And no one in the publishing process noticed either?Emily2: Okay, let's say it's intentional. Maybe she... didn't want to label her?Emily1: Pfft. Yeah, sure. Because ""autism"" or ""neurodivergent"" would be bad, scary words, whereas ""quirky"" is nice and cute and unthreatening?Emily2: You didn't have a problem with Eleanor Oliphant and it's not mentioned there either.Emily1: But it was believable to me that Eleanor was passing as eccentric-- Eleanor was so much like me that I didn't understand why others thought she was autistic when I first read it (I didn't know I was at the time) --not so much Molly. And it wasn't so damn quirky, so manic aspie dream girl.Emily2: 'kay. Write your review, grouch.I didn't find it to be like Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, as some other readers did. Eleanor Oliphant was, I felt, quite a dark read with a few uplifting moments, whereas The Maid was often teeth-grindingly twee and quirky. This latter also didn't sit quite right with me.The premise is that Molly, a maid at the Regency Grand Hotel, one day finds one of the hotel's wealthiest guests dead in their bed. Looks like foul play, but who could have done it? Molly gets dragged deeper and deeper into the mystery until she herself starts to look guilty.Many reviewers have described the protagonist, Molly, as neurodivergent or autistic, and I agree she does seem to be pretty much a checklist of stereotypes for autism, though the author either has not noticed this or is playing it very coy. Despite the modern setting, the characters in this book act like it's at least thirty years ago, scratching their heads at the ""odd"" Molly, jaws dropping when she behaves ""weird"". I could believe Eleanor Oliphant went through her life with undiagnosed autism (I related to her a lot and I didn't find out until my twenties) but I find it harder to believe with Molly.Are there people like Molly? Sure there are. Autistic people are all so different that there must be a Molly somewhere. But the way the author used her to pop up and say something comically straightforward, the way her quirks resulted in ludicrous moments... I couldn't help feeling that the author was, as Molly would say, laughing at her, not with her.It's not just Molly, though. Juan Manuel (a Mexican undocumented immigrant who is involved in a drug ring) is another character who seemed to verge too close to being the butt of the joke. The author writes him as naive, unintelligent and helpless. When both he and Molly find themselves in hot water, you can bet it's a couple of white neurotypical characters who save the day.To be honest, though, it wasn't just the depiction of Molly and Juan, or the refusal to mention neurodivergence, that bothered me, but the whole tone of the book. The whole slightly farcical, whimsical nature of it. I have low tolerance for whimsy anyway, but it felt especially off in a book with a protagonist like Molly. Please let's not have a manic aspie dream girl subgenre.","Not gonna lie, The Maid was a disappointment. After all the praises heaped on it, I'm not sure I read the same book as everyone else.Molly loves order and cleanliness. It's a good thing she works as a maid at the Regency Grand Hotel, ensuring that every room is meticulously made up to her high standards. When she finds a dead body in one of her rooms, she's immediately the prime suspect. I mean, who would have more to gain from the death of a customer than a lowly maid?If you're confused by this premise, you're not alone. It doesn't make any sense. Why would the maid be the prime suspect? But let's move on, because that seems to be the least of my problems with this book.Where to even start? Clearly, Molly is supposed to be on the autistic spectrum. She has problems understanding social cues and reading others and is obsessed with cleanliness. Except she doesn't read like a fully-formed autistic person so much as a neurotypical author's fantasy of what a cutesy, loveable one should be.She is depicted as essentially a precocious but dumb child. She is naïve to the point of incredulity. She is unable to understand the simplest of interactions, even when the other person is being direct. She bumbles around, sticking her foot in her mouth and acting as strange as possible to forward the plot of story. However, that's only when it suits the story. Other times, she has more insight than anyone else, even when it comes to things unsaid. Inconsistent much?It's clear that the author cherry-picked the autistic characteristics that would best serve her story, then exaggerated them to the point of making Molly seem infantile, and created a whole plot out of it. So what's the problem? Well, there's something off about a neurotypical author crafting an adorably stupid but inauthentic autistic character, all for the sake of entertaining a predominantly neurotypical audience. In fact, it feels decidedly icky. But it's not just Molly who is depicted as a dumb brick. What is up with Juan Manuel? Just because he's an immigrant doesn't mean he's stupid, but the book seems to equate the two. *facepalm* In fact, there is a simplicity and one-dimensionally, not to mention stereotyping, of every character in here that grated on my nerves.I also have a problem with the story in general. It was so slow and hardly anything happens, I was bored most of the time. There is so much filler, with lots of passages on cleaning and reminiscing of the past. Every development is spelled out in so much detail, just in case the reader is dumb too. The actual plot is straightforward and probably could've been told in 50 pages. And the end was just ludicrous, with a few ""twists"" thrown in for shock factor, even though they don't make sense for the story or the characters.However, not all is bad. Every time someone wrongs Molly and she figures it out, she'll wish evil things on them in the most creative and explicit fashion. And those few gems totally made me chuckle. So I'll give an extra star for that.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

The Boomerang,Robert  Bailey,4.54,"To say Robert Bailey’s political thriller, 
The Boomerang,
 demands a reader’s attention would be an understatement. The new president of the United States, Lionel Jefferson Cantrell, has terminal cancer. One of the few who know this is his Chief of Staff Eli James, his long-time friend. But soon, Eli learns his seventeen-year-old daughter Bella has terminal cancer too.Eli is determined to find a solution and turns to a pharmaceutical lobbyist for advice. Their discussion leads to more questions than answers and he enlists the help of family. Along the way, he discovers a cover-up worth billions of dollars and millions of lives. With the deadly secret, Eli forms an alliance with Nester Sanchez in New Mexico and works to get his family there as a showdown approaches.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Eli uses charm and lies to get what he wants. He’s a hard worker and calm in a crisis. He’s also great at raising money and smearing political opponents. He loves his daughter and will do anything to protect her. Lionel is ambitious and puts politics above everything else. Nester is known for this ruthless power tactics. He doesn’t make decisions based on emotion and is cautious in those he trusts. He has a criminal reputation, but is respected in New Mexico. Eli’s wife Dale is a trial attorney who specializes in medical malpractice cases. Each character has flaws and strengths that come through clearly in their actions and words.If you enjoy action-packed political thrillers with heart, then look no further than this novel. The intensity and sense of urgency kept me rapidly turning the pages with gripping scenes, action, danger, an excellent plot, and fantastic writing. The world-building and atmosphere immediately transported me to the various locations, whether the action was in the White House, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, or New Mexico. The way Eli deals with the bad personal news has a huge impact on the reader, but that is just one of the dramas playing out. With twists, turns, and action, the story unfolds at a rapid pace. The ending is impactful and insightful. Topics include terminal illness, power, money, family, friendship, secrets, death, and much more.Overall, this is a gritty and suspenseful high-stakes thriller that has an outstanding premise and is also thought-provoking and filled with extraordinary, but flawed characters. It’s also moving and has heart. This is the first book that I have read by this author but it won’t be the last. I highly recommend this novel.Thomas and Mercer and Robert Bailey provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my own.

The topic - truly concerning. The characters were written well. The plot was paced perfectly. I had a hard time putting down this book. I really appreciated a lot of the settings as well, growing up in Alabama (War Eagle), living in Florida for several decades, and then moving back home to Alabama. All of the places on the Gulf Coast made me wistful for days gone by.","“The Boomerang” is a potboiler of a novel, more soap opera than political thriller. It’s not very believable, but many may find it entertaining.Lionel and Eli have been best friends since boyhood in Alabama. Eli helped Lionel get elected President. Lionel has just been inaugurated. Eli is his Chief of Staff. What Lionel hasn’t told anyone—not even Eli—is that cancer will kill him well before the end of his term.Nevertheless, somehow, several highly placed government officials have learned of Lionel’s cancer. They control a cure that must remain secret so as not to damage the multi-billion-dollar cancer care industry or Big Pharma, a principal contributor to Lionel’s campaign. In exchange for the cure, he must keep it an absolute secret.And then Eli’s daughter is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.Eli and his wife, Dale, are determined to find a cure. Not even the divorce Dana has filed because of Eli’s infidelity with a beautiful lobbyist for Big Pharma will deter them. Nor will Dana’s job as a high-powered lawyer. Nor will her close friendship with client Nestor, one of the richest, most powerful men in the Southwest. Through Dana, Nestor became the largest contributor to Lionel’s campaign. Having underworld ties and indicted by the Feds for, among other things, campaign contribution violations, Nestor needs a presidential pardon—a pardon that would make Lionel and Eli look very, very corrupt.The good news? The novel is filled with conflict. Readers who can get caught up in those conflicts may find much to enjoy.The bad news? The characters aren’t very likable. Most suffer from ""moral bankruptcy."" Also, the story isn’t very believable. While it’s long on material about cancer and its effects on family, including lots of emotional angst, it’s short on credible plotting and convincing depictions of Washington and how it works. I never once got the sense that the author knew much about the White House, or life there, or the day-to-day nitty-gritty of DC political life. Readers hoping for an “Advise and Consent,” “The Last Hurrah,” “All the King’s Men,” “Primary Colors,” or “House of Cards” may be disappointed.But readers hoping for a novel that is not steeped in today’s marquee political issues, or who can overlook some of the plot holes and coincidences that, for me, damaged credibility, may find this entertaining."
The Lost Apothecary,Sarah Penner,3.76,"This concept needs to be confiscated from Sarah Penner immediately and given to literally any other writer. Between the lovely cover, the book of the month club endorsement and the promise of a Georgian female serial killer working on behalf of wronged women, I was so excited for this book. To say it was a letdown is a massive understatement. I was expecting a sort of “How’d she get away with it” revenge narrative about a woman who has been pushed to the brink by the cruelty of men and good-old-fashioned 1790s misogyny. I was expecting a deep dive into this woman’s character that would either be thrillerish or a more lighthearted caper-style romp. I was down for either of those. What I got was The Davinci Code: For Her. With an inexplicable dash of Julie & Julia. The story goes back and forth between 3 POV characters. There’s Nella, the apothecary owner who poisons people, Eliza the twelve-year-old girl who’s a little too chill about poisoning a guy, (so far so good), and then there’s Caroline. Caroline is a present-day character who finds a vial on the bank of the Thames that came from Nella’s apothecary. Caroline has just gone to London without her husband because she found out he was cheating on her. The book did a really good job of making me think her husband sucked right away—but it did an even better job of convincing me that Caroline sucked. She just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense and many of her actions defy any kind of human logic (same is true of her husband, I’ll get to that in a minute). Right away we find out that ~she’s not like other girls~ because while everyone else went to coffee shops in college, she poured over ~historical documents ~ and read ~novels from the 1800s~. Things no other college student has ever done. If you think I’m kidding here’s the actual line: “I could lose myself for hours in these seemingly meaningless documents, while my classmates met at coffee shops to study. I couldn’t attribute my unconventional interests to anything specific, I only knew that classroom debates about civil revolution and power-hungry world leaders left me yawning.” (Page 17) (Yes, somehow, we are not even 20 pages in). The first person makes that attitude especially insufferable. She then gets married to James, a man who seems hell bent on making her feel dumb. Great start. Shocked he cheated. Anyway, after college, Caroline seems to be angry that reading books and ~historical documents~ didn’t immediately get her a job. A twist no one saw coming. She almost applies to Cambridge but then doesn’t because she marries James the Jackass—and we all know that you can either have a degree or a husband. She chooses husband and her husband wants to stay in the states. Little known fact I learned from this book, literally no university in the states offers a master’s degree. They only count if they’re from Cambridge. Oxford isn’t mentioned so unclear if their masters’ degrees count for anything. Here’s where Caroline completely lost me: she kinda takes her anger about not being handed a job because she likes books out on… **checks notes** the books? Here’s a direct quote: “…thinking only briefly of the boxes still in our basement, packed away with the dozens of books I’d adored in school. Northanger Abbey, Rebecca, Mrs.Dalloway. What good had they done me?” She swears off books for good and gets a clerk job at her family’s farm. I have a lot of questions about that, but the novel answers none of them. She finally gets a job doing admin work for the family farm apparently unaware that you can still read books if you have a day job. Then she becomes obsessed with getting pregnant. We have not yet hit page 30. Spoilers beyond this point! (I highly recommend you don’t waste your time on this novel, but if you still think you might read it and care about spoilers this is a good place to stop). Here’s a quick rundown of the female characters in this book: Nella: Wishes she was pregnant. Caroline: Wished she was pregnant, spends majority of book thinking she is pregnant. Lady Clarence: Wants to murder her husband’s lover so she can get pregnant. Eliza: Is 12 and thankfully is not pregnant but she does think her period is a ghost which I think deserves an honorable mention. Gaynor: Is actually a historian and is, of course, exempt from pregnancy and thoughts thereof. Yikes. I would be willing to roll with this if it wasn’t such a high percentage of female characters and if it was examined or dealt with in any kind of thoughtful way. It is not. In fact, the desire to be pregnant/ have a child pops up in the weirdest ways at the weirdest times. Caroline by far wins most bizarre. Her husband is puking blood and the EMTs are telling her she should probably get rid of the stuff her husband ingested, especially if there are kids around. She then is upset that she doesn’t have a kid to potentially get poisoned / witness their father get carried away on a stretcher. Which brings me to another weird-ass plot point. James is so upset that Caroline is mad at him for having an affair he willingly drinks just a little bit of toxic Eucalyptus oil to…**checks notes again** get her to stop being mad at him via medical emergency. Because nothing says “honey, let’s get back together” like puking blood in a hotel room in foreign country. And then there’s Caroline’s discovery of the apothecary. This is where we get The Davinci Code: For Her. She finds the vial. Then she miraculously finds the apothecary. There’s just been this door in the middle of urban London that somehow no one else has seen since 1790. No one tore it down to build luxury flats! The Nazis bombed around it! Everyone who lives on that alley just kind of pretends it’s not there! She finds it in about two minutes. She finds all these documents inside from 1791, touches them with her bare hands, messes up one of them and then ultimately just takes cellphone pics and leaves them all there. She then tells Gaynor, her buddy at the British Library all about it and Gaynor thinks it’s interesting but sees no need to go get the documents out of the forgotten cellar thing. Historians and librarians are both known for being super chill about old documents being exposed to the elements, so this makes sense. Caroline then reads the pictures of the documents and reads some articles Gaynor the Historian found for her. She’s shocked to find out that they match up perfectly and she’s able to jump to all sorts of conclusions without so much as an additional Google search. Incredible research skills. All that time she spent not at coffee shops clearly paid off. You may be wondering what’s going on in the 1790s, apothecary of poisons part of the novel. You know, the part that sounded interesting. Well, it was somehow really boring despite there being two murders and a police chase. Oh, at one point the 12-year-old throws herself off of Blackfriars Bridge but she survives impact and icy water because she… **checks notes a third time** drank a tincture that made her really warm…At the end the police are pretty sure Nella is the poisoner they’re after, but ultimately let her go because they decide in the middle of the street, after the chase, that they don’t have enough evidence to arrest a low-ish class woman. So that’s nice of them. Really feels authentic for 1791. At the end of the book Caroline does dump James & the Giant Jackass, but possibly only temporarily. There’s an implication that after some time apart and after Caroline finishes her masters’ degree in Cambridge they could get back together. It’s left open-ended. I don’t have a joke here, I just hate that. Caroline does submit an application to Cambridge. I guess she forgave the books for not getting her a job after all. It’ll be tough to get in of course. Especially because that’s literally the only school where you can get a Master’s. She talks to Gaynor The Actual Professional Researcher about how she wants to write a dissertation about the apothecary. Guess what Caroline is getting a degree in? If you guessed History you are entirely too logical for this novel. No, she’s getting a degree in English literature specifically she’s applied for a program that covers “18th century and Romanticism” You may notice that’s two centuries and two very different periods of literature jammed together, but at this point who’s counting.This book ends all too soon. We are robbed of the Cambridge professor’s reaction when she tells them her dissertation will be—not on a work of literature—but a ledger she found in a mysterious basement. Would love to be a fly on the wall for that one. In short, my sanity has suffered. 0/10 do not recommend.","How can this story be so dull? It's about a secret apothecary that dispenses poison to women so that they can kill their nearest and dearest, for crying out loud!It starts off with much promise. In the 18th century, we meet Nella, an apothecarist who has been making poison for decades. Women come to her when they have nowhere else to turn, and she provides them with the method to kill their problems. When a young girl named Eliza enters her shop, it sets in motion a chain of events from which there is no turning back. In the present, we also follow history buff Caroline as she vacations in London and researches the apothecary from centuries ago.The book blurb completely grabbed me. I was ready for excitement and suspense, especially because it also promises to have a mystery and a little bit of magical realism/fantasy sprinkled in. So I started reading and turning the pages, waiting for something riveting to grab ahold of me. And unfortunately, nothing ever did.To say this story is slow is an understatement. With a dual timeline, there's always this fear that one of them might be more compelling than the other, and that's definitely what happened here. The storyline with Nella and Eliza is the focal point. But even then, what should have been a fascinating narrative quickly becomes plodding. It feels like the exciting moments are glossed over quickly and the mundane ones are stretched out to fill up the pages.It doesn't help that Caroline's story is completely unnecessary. I can see that the author is trying to juxtapose Caroline's personal growth with what happened to Nella and Eliza, but it just doesn't work, mostly because there are no similarities other than trivial ones. I didn't understand why Caroline would be interested in looking into the apothecary, or why she tried to keep it a secret from everyone, or really anything she did.This story also employs one of my pet peeves, which is that pretty much every conflict comes from a misunderstanding that can be quickly explained away with a sentence or two. Not telling the truth isn't that interesting of a plot device. And also every character makes a mountain out of a molehill, whether it's deciding to panic or pulling meaning out of irrelevant conversations or interactions.For me, this is a case where the book overpromised and underdelivered. Based on the description of the book, I expected mystery and intrigue, darkness, suspense, magical realism. But none of these occurred because the book is 100% historical fiction, and it wasn't a very interesting one at that. Instead, it became a slogfest through an utterly forgettable story, one I'm already having trouble remembering only days after finishing it.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I was mudlarking—hunting the river for old treasures, which is the inspiration for my debut novel, The Lost Apothecary. Given such an adventure would be impossible right now, I hope my novel provides you an opportunity to escape back in time and embark on a story that begins with one woman’s discovery of a mysterious vial on the banks of the River Thames. The vial is connected to a string of unsolved murders two centuries ago and the female poisoner behind them—an apothecary who sells well-disguised poisons to other women seeking freedom from the men who have wronged them.The Lost Apothecary is very much a story about women controlling their own destinies. There are dark aspects to the story—like the burden of secrets and the destructive pursuit of vengeance—but it is also a story of hope and the way women can protect, honor, and free one another, even when separated by the barrier of time. While researching this book, I loved digging into historical documents and antiquated ephemera, particularly those relating to eighteenth-century London. Over the last few years, I’ve happily passed many an afternoon in the Rare Books room of the British Library, my head buried in fragile manuscripts from bygone eras. I’ve studied firsthand accounts of apothecaries, druggists, and poisoners. (I know enough to be dangerous, as they say.) So, although The Lost Apothecary is a work of fiction, I have done my best to research and craft a story that is true to history. As lockdowns continue and many of us turn to books to escape our present reality, I hope you feel swept away by the mysterious world of The Lost Apothecary and the complex female heroines at its heart. You will become familiar with the secret apothecary shop and the many vials lining the shelves—their contents, their preparations, their sinister uses—and peek into the apothecary’s register of names, discovering who stepped through her hidden door in pursuit of poison. And you will, of course, be alongside the apothecary when the unthinkable happens and her greatest secret is exposed.I invite you now to leave your own lockdown, if only in your imagination, and join me on the banks of the River Thames. Together, we can begin to unbury the secrets belonging to the lost apothecary. I only ask that you tread carefully—for the apothecary is a clever woman and a master of disguise. Cheers,Sarah Penner"
All Good People Here,Ashley Flowers,3.83,"2.5 stars, rounded downOk debut, but sudden ending that totally felt unfinished. Didn’t really grab me, nothing really surprised me. I think I expected a lot due to the author's history as a crime podcast producer, and maybe I would have liked the book more had I not known her background. As it is, this is the story of journalist Margot, who returns to her small hometown in Indiana because her uncle who raised her is suffering from progressing dementia. When she was six years old, the little girl across the street was abducted and murdered, the case went unsolved. Soon after Margot arrives, another little girl goes missing in the area. Margot sees connections and is determined to investigate. Are they really connected?What I liked:I'm always a fan of cold case stories and those of missing people. The mystery aspect compelled me to keep reading.What I didn't:This is so similar to JonBenet Ramsey's case. Too many similarities and possibly the writer pushing her agenda of what she thinks happened with that one. Like I said before, there really aren't any surprises, and if there are, there's not enough suspenseful tension built up to make the reader care about the identity of the villain(s). The character development just isn't there with any of the characters. Although we get a past storyline and a present one, they aren't fleshed out very well to provide enough of a background to connect with anyone.And where I could forgive all of that and still say this was a halfway decent first book attempt, what I can't get past is the non-ending. You have Margot confronting someone and then...it just ends. I felt like something was left off, I actually turned back in my kindle to see if I accidentally skipped some pages, but no. This is the reason for me rounding down. Give me an ending, don't just make things all ambiguous. I may read something else Flowers writes to see if she develops her skill as a book writer with more practice.Want to know Spoilers about the ending and who did it? Check out my blog post:Spoiler Alert! All Good People HereI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.","2.0 stars — I have heard a lot of talk about “All Good People Here” due to it being the first novel written by Ashley Flowers, the host of the popular podcast, “Crime Junkie.” My thoughts after reading this book are — Flowers does a great job as the host of the popular podcast, “Crime Junkies.” Maybe the podcast recently covered the Jon Benet Ramsay murder because the first third of the book is almost identical to the details of that crime. The book diverges from there, but despite a story that has its interesting moments, the writing is so poor that it detracts from what could have been a good murder mystery. The main character, Margot, is a local reporter who returns home to take care of her ailing uncle while working remotely from his home. When a local girl is murdered under similar circumstances as the unsolved murder of Margot’s childhood best friend, Margot goes on a mission to try and prove they’re connected and solve them both. The story requires the reader to put away his/her common sense on multiple occasions which becomes harder with each eye rolling moment. A mother convinced her 6 YEAR OLD son beat his twin sister to death..Yep. A wife and mother who professes to never have been gay decides in middle age to enter into a long term lesbian relationship with an old classmate (wouldnt she have had some attraction before then).. why not? And my favorite… a character kidnapped after standing outside at night and turning her back on an approaching vehicle, whose driver pulls to a stop, the driver exits and an older woman kidnapper grabs the character from behind and drags her back to her vehicle where she forces her inside and drives away. Trust me I had to read it twice and still can’t believe this was part of this novel. ANNNNNND my biggest gripe of all: she doesn’t reveal what happens to the main character and the story is left unresolved. I HATE that most of all, and can’t remember an author who left the reader with such a giant question mark for an ending. So if there is a sequel someone let me know what happened because I’m not reading it.","Hmm… a semi-satisfying read—I was so close to loving this book, but the abrupt ending left me with second thoughts. A review is coming up!The story’s strengths lie in its true crime and podcast elements, the tight-knit, conservative small-town setting, and an intriguing plot that weaves together two girls’ brutal murder investigations, connecting past tragedies with the present.Margot Davies returns to her hometown of Wakarusa after 20 years. The community was shaken by the brutal murder of her childhood best friend, January Jacobs, a tragedy that continues to haunt the Jacobs family, who are still torn apart by secrets. Margot, now a journalist, comes back to care for her 50-year-old uncle, Luke, the only father figure in her life after her father’s failures.Shortly after her return, the murder of Natalie Clark in nearby Nappanee reignites the town’s fears, and vandalism at the Jacobs’ house stirs up memories of January’s kidnapping and death two decades earlier. Though Margot loses her newspaper job due to the time spent caring for her uncle, she remains determined to uncover the town’s buried secrets—even if that means confronting her own family’s hidden past.The book started strong, but the pace slowed significantly, making some chapters feel drawn out. I was ready to round up my rating to 4 stars, but the abrupt and ambiguous ending, which leaves readers to fill in the gaps themselves, left me feeling only semi-satisfied. So, I settled on a solid 3 stars—not great, but still an okay read.Despite the ending, I’m still interested in reading the author’s future works. This was a promising start!Special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/Ballantine for providing this digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts"
The Woman in the Cabin,Becca Day,4.03,"I was instantly absorbed in this book from the very beginning. I enjoyed the isolated setting, the sense of dread, the tension, and the looming danger that lurks just under the surface. I found this book to be fast paced, and kept me on the edge of my seat, feeling anxious amongst other feelings. Mary and her husband, Cal live in a cabin in the Scottish Highlands. They live a quiet life and while Cal is at work each day, Mary tends to the garden and makes sure that their cabin is clean and there is food heating on the stove and a smile on her face when Cal returns home each day. It's a routine that works for them, or is it?????From the very beginning, we know that Mary is not happy. She is fearful and treads lightly around Cal. She is trapped and has not been able to leave but she has a plan......Readers are privy to Mary's thoughts and emotions as well as her day-to-day activities. We serve as silent observers to her relationship with Cal and the dynamic of their 'relationship'. I could feel the sense of unease oozing from the pages. I found myself feeling for Mary and holding my breath grew increasingly concerned for her in several scenes.Have we seen this type of plot before? Yes, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment and impact this book had on this reader. There are a nice number of twists in this book and there were two that I did not see coming. The book did take a turn toward the end which I did not see coming. I wasn’t the biggest fan of it, but it wasn't enough to hinder my enjoyment of the book. *This is a tale of survival and the effects of trauma. There will be triggers for some as there is both physical and psychological abuse. 3.5 starsThank you to Embla Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖","Mary lives with her husband Cal in a secluded cabin in the Scottish Highlands.

Then Mary discovers she's pregnant and the stakes of her escaping become not only more perilous but imperative. She must save her child. Will she succeed in her plans to escape a monster? You'll have to read this to find out. Been there, done that in a million other stories. It's competently written just not really surprising in any way. My biggest problem was that I just didn't care about Mary which is really important to a story of this type.

How to Solve Your Own Murder,Kristen Perrin,3.79,"Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","Agatha Christie-esque, intelligent, captivating; a small-town mystery that seizes your attention from the opening scene, introducing the relatable and easy-to-engage young protagonist, Annie Adams. The plot immediately intrigues with the tale of Annie's eccentric, wealthy great-aunt, Frances, who has spent nearly sixty years expecting her own murder, driven by a fortuneteller's prophecy that has eerily come true with each revelation.This book beckons me to dive in without delay, promising an enthralling murder mystery and a challenging guessing game, all delivered with a riveting pace that leaves you breathless until the final pages, deserving of a solid 5-star rating.At the outset, we're introduced to Annie Adams, a mystery author who recently left her day job. She receives an invitation from her estranged and eccentric great-aunt, Frances, a wealthy busybody with a fixation on solving her future murder before it occurs. Annie hesitates over the decision, but her curiosity wins out, and she heads to Castle Knoll, Frances' estate, to discuss recent changes to her will. It appears Annie is the newly designated heir, tied to the fortuneteller's enigmatic prediction: ""but the daughters are the key to justice, find the right one and keep her close.""As Annie arrives at Castle Knoll and meets Frances' lawyer and old friend, Walter Gordon, along with his brusque and work-driven son, Oliver, and the dramatic, irritating Elva, the wife of Frances' late husband's niece Saxon, it becomes evident that a complex web of dysfunctional relationships is entwined with Frances. The narrative takes a twist when Frances is found lying lifeless on the floor. The question looms: Is it natural causes, or has someone finally fulfilled her long-held expectations of murder?During the will reading, Annie learns that Frances may leave her entire estate to the person who uncovers the truth behind her impending murder. Competing with her are Saxon, determined to claim what he believes is rightfully his, and the charismatic Detective Crane, armed with experience and resources to solve the crime.While she may appear the weakest link among her rivals, Annie's immediate connection to Frances through an old diary – revealing a complex friendship with Rose and Emily, including the unsolved mystery of Emily's vanishing – serves to activate her grey matter, propelling her to pursue justice for her great-aunt.In the face of death threats, an escalating race against time, and mounting pressure to uncover the truth, Annie fights to protect her mother's home and Gravesdown Estate from developers, outmaneuvering Saxon's psychological games, and partnering with Detective Crane to exploit his resources. As tension mounts and danger escalates, Annie becomes entangled in a deadly race that imperils her own life.Overall, this book is an unputdownable, clever, and twist-laden whodunit that unequivocally earns its 5 stars. The execution of the mystery is superb, and I found myself fully invested in each character's journey. I'm hopeful for sequels, intrigued by the prospect of more unopened diaries from great-aunt Frances. I eagerly anticipate more adventures with the promising amateur detective, Annie Adams.A heartfelt thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group Dutton for providing me with the digital reviewer copy of this exceptional book in exchange for my honest review.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","This book made me feel like I'd lost my mind. So, the main character Annie is a mystery writer. Or...she wants to be. Unclear if she's actually finished anything. But it's her passion, so when she's confronted with a REAL mystery, this is her time to shine, right? This is a woman who wants to make a career out of writing about crimes getting solved. You assume she must have read extensively in the genre, knows all the ingredients to a good mystery, how to treat clues and all that. I mean you assume that, as a human person alive in contemporary times, she's at the very least come across some media about crime and has a basic understanding of how crime-solving works. Then there's a murder of a woman who, famously, believed her whole life that she would be murdered. It's a little messy getting the cops to the scene, but they look it over and I guess say it was natural causes (???). Later, Annie's at the scene. She's poking around what should still be an active crime scene, but I guess the cops had too much cozy village stuff to do so they just bailed and left it as-is. And she finds what she thinks is the murder weapon. Oh dang! Well, time to back away and call back the incompetent cops who missed this obvious thing, right? Especially since the thing could cause further injury if handled. Right?Right?No. Annie grabs the potential murder weapon - yeah, picks it up with her bare hands - get it into a car, and takes it to the police station. Oh, of course it injures her as well. And the cop seems to be untroubled by the way this woman removed a weapon from a crime scene and then transported it elsewhere, contaminating any evidence that might have still been available under all her added fingerprints. I - what? I'm just, I'm so sorry. This is like writing a main character who desperately wants to be an astronaut, who then finally gets to NASA, looks around, and asks the first person she sees, ""So how do we get to the moon? Do we take a car?"" And then agents, editors, friends, and everyone else who read the book gets to that part, sees no problem with it in any capacity, the book gets printed and lands in my hands, and I think I've gone absolutely stark raving mad because there are also hundreds of reviews where NOBODY ELSE mentions this insane, glaring, obvious, ridiculous, dismaying moment that completely removes any credibility from the main character and also demonstrates an astonishing lack of care not just for the genre but for, like, the intelligence of the reader...I just...what? Anyway, then the main character finishes the book by going to the moon because she's just sooo smart actually, and everyone else at NASA ferries her around and holds her hand on the way. This book is apparently the start of a series, which feels like a threat, but at least explains why most of the bloated cast of characters barely gets any characterization. It also explains the glanced over suggestion of a future love triangle where one of them is a jerk and the other is a cop, gag me with a spoon. I have to also point out the very strange writing style here in which the present day narrator has the voice of a teenager (seriously, how old is she supposed to be? she acts like a 17 year old but apparently graduated from Central St. Martins which is an incredibly prestigious school to go to for a person who didn't commit to a career in fashion and also acts pretty dumb) while the flashback scenes (allegedly journals, but written narratively with full dialogue which I'd complain about were the rest of this book not so much worse) that are actually from the perspective of a 17 year old seem much more maturely written. I'm so glad this book is over. My thanks to Penguin Group Dutton and NetGalley for the ARC."
And Then There Were None,Agatha Christie,4.28,"This lovely mystery book is first and foremost about the administration of the long-overdue justice, right? At least that's what the mastermind behind it all believes.But the question is - who has the right to decide what justice is? And who is to decide what punishment serves the crime? And is perceived justice at all costs the ultimate goal, or is it the frequently pointless work of a maniac? As a matter of fact, what is justice after all?

I think the story of this book (the one that may win the contest for the most offensive original title, after all) is familiar to most readers. It is a lovely and fascinating idea. Ten people are lured onto a remote island under false pretenses just to realize that they are all about to be punished by death for the 'crimes' that they have committed in the past and have gotten away with. Killed in a manner predicted by a silly yet ominous children's poem with the conclusion of ""... and then there were none"". What's more, they come to realize that the mastermind - or maniac? - has to be among them. And the (very polite, in the traditional British way) game of survival begins, complete with all the necessary societal rituals¹ and classism² that are not disposed of even under the threat of imminent demise.¹The politeness and overt show of respect to one another even in the face of imminent murder by someone in their midst - because, of course, you would not want to offend anyone. Continuing to socialize and take meals together. Insisting on chivalry when a woman could be the murderer just as well as a man - these are just some of the examples.² Just think of everyone expecting the impeccable service by the butler even though HIS WIFE JUST DIED! Everyone deciding to stick together and be careful - but never including the servants in it. The belief by some that people of 'proper class' would be incapable of murder. The list can go on and on. And all of these assumptions prove to be wrong.
And as, despite the precautions, the number of people trapped on the island continues to decline, the uneasy tension sets in, and the impeccable facades begin to crack.""The oth­ers went up­stairs, a slow unwilling pro­ces­sion. If this had been an old house, with creak­ing wood, and dark shad­ows, and heav­ily pan­elled walls, there might have been an eerie feel­ing. But this house was the essence of moder­ni­ty. There were no dark corners - ​no possi­ble slid­ing pan­els - it was flood­ed with elec­tric light - everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hid­den in this house, noth­ing con­cealed. It had no at­mo­sphere about it. Some­how, that was the most fright­en­ing thing of all. They ex­changed good-​nights on the up­per land­ing. Each of them went in­to his or her own room, and each of them automatical­ly, al­most with­out con­scious thought, locked the door.""The story is captivating and very smart, and the ending had me baffled for a bit the first time I read it. It has a neat resolution despite an obvious plot hole (but hey, it doesn’t bother me that much). It's an enjoyable read to say the least. But what made me unsettled both of the times I read it was the nagging question of justice, as I mentioned above. Yes, on one hand, it's almost poetic justice to punish the criminals who thought they got away with it. On the other hand, is eye-for-an-eye the best way to get even? And who's to judge, anyway? Who is either conceited enough or deranged enough to assume that he has the right and the moral authority to determine guilt and the extent of punishment just like that?Don't get me wrong - the people accused on the island are undeniably guilty (even though it's not necessarily murder as we think of for some of them - Vera Claythorne is really guilty of neglect, albeit with a desire to kill, and Emily Brent is pretty much guilty of being a judgmental über-righteous heartless prude). But the degree of their guilt varies quite significantly in my perception, and it does not always coincide with what their 'unknown' judge/executioner thinks (running two children over with a car and feeling no remorse is to me worse than firing a pregnant servant who then goes on to kill herself, for instance). And is arbitrarily and single-handedly determining their guilt and doling out punishments not just as much (or even much worse) or a crime than they have committed? Conceited, self-righteous crime? Decide for yourself. 

Speaking of guilt - this novel has quite a bit to say on this subject. You see, many of the characters have already been judged and condemned by their own selves. Vera Claythorne and General Macarthur both are tormented by their guilt, and at least one of them become a direct victim of it. Interestingly, others, no less guilty, are not tormented by their conscience at all. But ultimately this does not matter at all for their survival; only the fact that they were deemed guilty. So should being tormented by guilt versus a cold-blooded killer factor at all in the administration of justice?These are the thoughts that kept running through my head as I was reading this excellent non-traditional critically-acclaimed specimen of mystery literature. And therefore bravo to Miss Christie for making me think and care - and not just mindlessly flipping pages to get to the bottom of the whodunit. Because 'WHO' was much less important to me than 'HOW' and 'WHY' - especially 'WHY'. For all of this, I give it the unflinching guilt-free 4 stars.——————Also posted on my blog.","There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting.**In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last.
“Be sure thy sin will find thee out.”
Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid. This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? 
“Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.”
If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None, it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies.Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.","The story goes a bit like this:10 strangers each get invitations from someone they think they know to stay on an island resort. Hells yeah! Sunshine & sea air!Well, resort is a bit of a misnomer. It's really a big house on an island. Still, it's famous for being a party place, and nobody in the group turns it down.BIG MISTAKE.Almost as soon as everyone is gathered together, a recorded voice booms out through the walls and accuses each of them of being a murderer. And not just...YOU'RE ALL MURDERERS! Nope, whoever it is appears to know specific details about each death, and why these particular people were responsible. Of course, everyone immediately starts proclaiming their innocence!Wha..? Noooo! That person died accidentally! I was never even a suspect! Who dares...?! Harrumph & bluster!However, within minutes one of them falls over dead.Suicide? Or something more nefarious?! As the body count rises, they have to face the fact that these aren't accidents. And with each new death coinciding with a children's rhyme that's tacked up in each room, all signs point to a self-appointed executioner in their midst.After they get organized and take a peek around, they realize that they are quite alone on this island. Their mysterious benefactor must be disguised as one of the guests, and is more than likely...the murderer.Dum, dum, duuuuum! The tension ratchets up with each body, and the guests start turning on each other in an attempt to ferret out the killer. Eventually, they decide they just need to calm down and survive till the police can get to the island. Good plan, right? But what if there isn't anyone left to tell the cops what happened? So whodunit? I ain't tellin'.Psst. The epilogue is really important. 2023I just listened to the BBC Radio Dramatization of this book. Wow! Well done!I would always suggest that you read or listen to the actual book beforehand, but this was really a wonderful adaptation of it for fans of Christie's story.Highly recommended if you get the chance."
Murder on the Orient Express,Agatha Christie,4.20,"I’m pretty astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but “early-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime” doesn’t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it’s completely cool ok???Let’s discuss the very limited number of things I won’t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you’re a detective too, and if that’s not the dream I don’t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don’t, I’d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn’t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I’m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie’s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That’s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people’s individual psychology. That would’ve upset me, probably, if it weren’t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written! I could’ve replaced this whole review with those adjectives and been much more convincing.---------------pre-reviewTHAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING!(I hope you read that in Aziz Ansari's voice. Reevaluate your life if otherwise.)review to come ---------------currently-reading updatesmy hobbies include: hopping on bandwagons","Murder on the Orient Express is arguably Agatha Christie's most famous Poirot story, and for good reason.Our Belgian detective is aboard the fabled Orient Express when a snowstorm stops the train on its tracks. When morning comes, it is discovered that a passenger has been stabbed to death in his locked compartment. With the snow outside, it becomes clear that the murderer must still be on the train, and it is up to Poirot to figure out who it is.This is my favorite type of murder mystery—a locked room. The suspects have nowhere to go and the guilty party must be one of them. What follows is a brilliantly twisty whodunnit with red herrings and interesting characters who all have something to hide. And when the solution is revealed, I'm blown away by the cleverness and how the clues were there all along. The only quibble I have is that Poirot goes and interviews each person one by one, which is then recorded in detail. This format is pretty common in quite a few Poirot books, but it isn't my preferred style. It can get boring and repetitive to hear each person describe the same event with just a slightly different spin. But that's usually over soon enough, and then we can get back to the exciting parts.I first started reading Agatha Christie in 8th grade, partly to learn English and partly because my younger self found murders fascinating. Thus began my love affair with Agatha Christie and she remains one of my favorite authors of all time. Often books we enjoy in our childhood do not hold up to rereadings as an adult, but this one sure does.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Death on the NileThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","When all the other little girls wanted to be princesses - do you know what I wanted to be?

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland (Translator)",4.17,"I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.","I really don't understand the critical orgasms over this book. Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it. Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: ""Did one of our employees recommend this?"" Um, yeah. And Amazon, too. So of course I asked him why. ""Oh,"" he replied, ""we've been told to recommend it this week."" That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management. Pfft. I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth? Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family. Of course it totally sucks. I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known. But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced. NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight. I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD. I mean bad. The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares. The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them. I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too. ""He went to the store. He bought milk. He was cold. He went home."" - BOR-RING! I am not really exaggerating, either. Actual content:""He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.""Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description. It sets the tone of ""lonely dude being lonely"" but really: two sandwiches? why two? sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse. I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read. I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead. Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG???I am not trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion. But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY. What am I missing?","Swedish people are nuts! I realize that’s a bit of a broad generalization and it sounds a bit rude, but I don’t care. Because more often than not, I’m nuts too.I was born and raised in Minnesota, and if you know our state history, you’re already aware that we were predominantly settled and populated by Swedish (and Norwegian) immigrants. So not only are many Minnesota residents of Scandinavian descent, myself included, a lot of our quirky mannerisms and even our accents are commonly attributed to this influence. I attended a Swedish Lutheran college (which attracted a lot of Swedish exchange students). And one of my oldest and dearest friends is an American by birth but was raised in Sweden and didn’t return to live full-time in the U.S. until she was 18. She’s always found Minnesotans to be a very interesting form of science experiment—what happens when you mix Swedish and American culture anyway? Taking what I know firsthand of Minnesota culture into consideration, I can only assume that Sweden, aka the motherland, is also a twisted place of dark, dry humor. Some mainstream examples that support this claim would include: Fargo, Drop Dead Gorgeous, A Prairie Home Companion and yes, even Mr. Purple Rain himself, who even though he’s genetically a bit more exotic than a plain old Swede, definitely displays some of the more oddball (but typical) Minnesota traits in his own special way. The point being, the characters in this book felt oddly familiar to me, quirks and all. I’m actually a bit surprised I loved the book as much as I did because I normally criticize authors for trying to jam too much into one story and this book had a lot going on:--shady business dealings--corporate fraud--murder--religious fanaticism--extramarital affairs--Nazis--casual sex--creepy pervs--violence against women--money laundering--sexual sadism--political proselytizing--dysfunctional family secretsAnd that’s just scraping the surface. Because once Larsson got into it and started digging deeper into the plot and revealing more details, my head started spinning and I had smoke coming out of my ears. I wasn’t expecting to be sucked in so quickly by the plot and am still reeling over the fact that this brick-like book (my copy has nearly 600 pages) went as quickly as it did. I just reserved the sequel from the library and am also excited at the prospects of a third. I’m also sad that Mr. Larsson passed away. What a talented author—not many could tie so much crazy shit into one story and still have it make sense AND be entertaining. Although I think whoever decided to change the title when they released this book in English is nuts too. The original Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, is much more fitting."
Gone Girl,Gillian Flynn,4.14,"3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr","As seen on The ReadventurerI am giving Gone Girl 3 stars, but only begrudgingly. In my mind, any book that takes me 3 months and 20 different tries to read is not worth 3 (i-liked-it on Goodreads) stars, especially a book written by an author I already respect. And I am not kidding, for me the first half of Gone Girl was a PURE TORTURE to read.Amy Dunn disappears on the day of her 5th wedding anniversary. All gradually uncovered evidence suggests that her husband, Nick, is somehow involved. Did he kill her? Was she kidnapped? What happened to Amy? One thing is clear, Nick and Amy's marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought.The first part of the novel is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's hidden diary. I strained and strained my brain trying to understand why this chunk of Gone Girl had no appeal to me whatsoever. The only answer I have is this: I am really not into reading about rich white people's problems. You want to whine to me about your dwindling trust fund? Losing your cushy New York job? Moving south and ""only"" renting a mansion there? Being unhappy because you have too much free time on your hands and you are used to only work as a hobby? You want to make fun of your lowly, un-posh neighbors and their casseroles? Well, I am not interested. I'd rather read about someone not necessarily likable, but at least worthy of my empathy, not waste my time on self-centered, spoiled, pathetic people who don't know what real problems are. Granted, characters in Flynn's previous novels (Sharp Objects and Dark Places) are pretty pathetic and and at times revolting too, but I always felt some strange empathy towards them, not annoyance and boredom, like I felt reading about Amy and Nick's marriage woes.But then second part, with its wicked twist, changed everything. The story became much more exciting, dangerous and deranged. The main characters revealed sides to them that were quite shocking and VERY entertaining. I thought the Gillian Flynn I knew before finally unleashed her talent for writing utterly unlikable and crafty women. THEN I got invested in the story, THEN I cared.Was it too little too late though? I think it was. Something needed to be done to make Gone Girl a better read. Make it shorter? Cut out first part completely? I don't know. But because of my uneven experience with this novel I won't be able to recommend Gone Girl as readily as I did Flynn's earlier novels, even though I think this horror marriage story (it's not a true mystery, IMO) has some brilliantly written psycho goodness in it and an absolutely messed up ending that many loathed but I LOVED. I wish it didn't take so much time and patience to get to all of that...","I get it now. After reading this book, I finally understand the appeal of the unreliable narrator.Up till now, for more than a decade, I did not understand. In fact, I've been so befuddled by it all, I've had to engage in deceit in order not to broadcast my lack of understanding. Because you see, during all this time, whenever anyone professed their love for domestic thrillers and the ubiquitous unreliable narrator, I've smiled and nodded along as if I also love those things. But in actuality, I had no idea what they were going on about.The unreliable narrators I've come across thus far had me under the mistaken impression that they must be of a very specific mold—always female, imbibing to the point of incoherence, acting unfathomably loony and paranoid, and going on and on about how no one believes them. In other words, a most unpleasant character there to frustrate the heck out of the reader and cause maximum eye-rolling and hair-tearing. You can see how I did not understand why anyone would love that.So to read Gone Girl feels like both a Eureka moment and a recognition—oh there you are, you compelling unreliable narrator, I've finally found you!What made this story work for me when so many others have failed? Well, the unreliable narrators here are smart, cunning, and sober, in other words the complete opposite of what I'm used to. No dumb, drunk, paranoid lush here, thank you very much.But it's more than that. The way the story unfolds is pretty brilliant too. You think you know what's going on, then the rug is pulled out from under you and everything you thought you knew changes. Both of the two main characters are unlikable but undeniably fascinating, and you want to keep turning the pages to see what they'd do next.And the writing is so sharp and precise, there to match perfectly to each situation and every version of the characters. There are so many insightful observations thrown in, about our culture and its ups and downs, about people and their hopes and dreams, and most of all, about marriage. At its heart, what made this story so disturbing is that there is a lot of truth written into this dark tale beneath all the exaggerations.Was this the perfect book? No, at least not for me. I did find the beginning rather slow and (what turned out to be justifiably) pretentious, the characters and the plot a tad over the top, and the ending somewhat lackluster after all that buildup. But honestly, that's just because domestic thrillers are never going to be my favorite thing.Still, it was a lot of fun to read the book that kicked off the craze. With how popular this book is and how much it influenced all that came after, it just wasn't possible to go into this completely blind. I went in already knowing about unreliable narrators and also having an inkling of what to expect. (Many years ago, I made the regrettable decision to read the synopsis of the movie in a moment of weakness.) And yet, even with all that, this still managed to surprise and entertain me.And most importantly, now I finally understand what everyone's talking about.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Holly  Jackson,4.29,"Yesss! The BBC series adaptation is announced to be released on Netflix on August 1st! It’s a date! Cannot wait!Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","You heard it here first, folks. I have found a new favorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!","""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""
Move aside, Nancy Drew! There's a new teen detective in town. And she won't rest until she's unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she's going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I'm always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I'm in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it's best if I'm so taken with the story that I'm only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I've outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I've been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers. And the fact that this is a series means I won't have to say goodbye to her just yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2. Good Girl, Bad Blood#3.

The Girl on the Train,Paula Hawkins,3.96,"I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street. I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!","“Esssscuse me.

Are you ready for a faster-paced, creepier Gone Girl?Woah. This is one unsettling little thriller and the best bit about it is that no one can be trusted, including the three female narrators who share the storytelling of this book. I literally read this entire novel in one sitting and I now need to find the words to convince you to go get your hands on it. RIGHT NOW.Between an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat, who can you trust? These are the three women at the centre of this book: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Have you ever sat on the train, glanced at the people around you or out of the window, and made up stories about them? Maybe you've even gone so far as to invent names for these people and imagine their perfect or not-so-perfect lives. Rachel is that girl on the train who takes her mind off her own life by imagining the lives of others. Specifically the lives of ""Jess and Jason"" who live at the house outside her train window when the train stops at the same red signal every morning. But then one morning, things are not as they are supposed to be and Rachel sees something that completely shatters the ""Jess and Jason"" image which exists in her head.Now she is pulled into their lives. Unsure exactly what she knows but certain she cannot rest until she finds out. This book is just full of secrets. Everyone has them. It's about all the little mysteries that exist just outside of what we see on the surface. What goes on behind closed doors? How much can you ever really know a person? What horrors exist in that black spot of your memory from Saturday night?It was fascinating, gripping and oh so very creepy.

The Silent Patient,Alex Michaelides,4.17,"| |  blog |  tumblr | ko-fi | |
“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”
I've been a bit hesitant about writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. However since Goodreads allows us to express and respect our different opinions I don't see any harm in being honest. I didn't hate The Silent Patient but I did find this novel both ridiculous and incompetent. Just because The Silent Patient has a ""twist"" that doesn't mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. The psychology in this one is...well, the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant. The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist that also renders the majority of the narrative completely irrelevant. This book seems to me yet another weak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.  In short: Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort of hackneyed script.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (
if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review
)The Silent Patient is a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎ THE WRITING (idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I like Agatha Christie and she has what I would call a 'dry' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters' mannerisms and surroundings. Michaelides' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and it reads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual people rather than this:
“Perhaps I’m imagining it. But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work. You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.” 
The dialogues/monologues came across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There were plenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruined potentially significant scenes and or somber moments of contemplation: 
“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth. [She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology of us that I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.” ~“How was this possible? Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?” ~“Why did she do it? How could she?”
 Jeez, melodramatic much? ✖ Theo’s narrative was filled with painfully overdone monologues that have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative. Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖ The Greek ‘connection’. Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics. Done properly. Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:
“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.
 We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis. Both the painting and Euripides play had potential. They would have been enough. We didn’t need the constant reminder that The Silent Patient wants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book, the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy. ✖ These characters do not sound British. They talk like Americans (or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere. ✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let's remember: this story could be set anywhere (or nowhere given how realistic it is).✖ You could say that the focus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such. This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script. There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.  A 2nd grade play is closer to a 'classic' play than this book is.✖ There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:
“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”. 
✎ THE CHARACTERS ✖ Theo. Our wannabe  Tom Ripley . Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is just soooo dull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,  and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that's what they do, isn't it?, and his attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. After  the big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis. This guy is soooo thick. His dramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness (I've said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖ Alicia...she is beautiful. She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...but how can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friends and her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms. Who is she charming to? She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections. Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like a demented child. Her character is just an object. She is there to look beautiful and tragic. She has a few basic reactions (she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she does the good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of a  betrayed and traumatised woman.✖ The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people. We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is a massive bellend bully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.” We have Professor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’ ...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,  I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia). Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story. He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so he obviously has to be weird about women. Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importance Theo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who, surprise surprise, are only mentioned once). We have a few ‘ugly’ characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent (Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave. Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel are the antithesis of credible  (actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’, boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment of some sort of art-vampire.✎ THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear that the words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That's about 70% of the novel. ✖ There are a series of stupid things happening for no apparent reason.  such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY. ✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything that happens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window. ✖ The ‘big twist’  is predictable. We know Theo is unreliable. All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ make no bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unless he is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein of The Talented Mr. Ripley, You, Lolita, or even Gentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse. IN CONCLUSION The Silent Patient might not be the worst novel I’ve read but it’s a badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still, The Silent Patient comes across as being both pointless and passionless. A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don't make your characters take themselves so seriously. A parody of a certain 'personality' should at least be funny and or amusing. Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either. Overall: The Silent Patient is a messy, flat, painfully dull, 'Hollywood-type' of book.

If you liked Verity, An Anonymous Girl, The Last Time I Lied or the unintentionally hilarious Jane Doe...chances are you will like The Silent Patient.","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.","This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if not the best, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Agatha Christie,4.00,"Choose Your Own Adventure!You are Captain Arthur Hastings, and you are slowly falling in love with a Belgian. The feelings are embarrassing at first; you find the Belgian himself to be quite an embarrassment. But there is just something about him. Could it be his suave, continental sense of humor... his keen sense of justice... his shapely, rubenesque figure? Or is it simply his hypnotic mustache, perhaps? The passion develops in fits and starts. You don’t want to love him, you really don’t. You don’t want to follow him around, adventure after adventure. You don’t want to be his little bitch, always at his beck and call, sniping and moaning at him but loving it nonetheless. You don’t like mysteries but you are about to fall victim to the greatest mystery of them all: the mystery of the human heart! Try as you may, the Belgian has hold of you, heart and soul. You will follow him forever.If you decide to follow the little Belgian to the ends of the earth, choose http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...If you decide that that love, and life, and the lives of others, are all just meaningless social constructs, choosehttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...","""Dear me, Poirot,"" I said with a sigh, ""I think you have explained everything! And how wonderful of you to wait until page 230 to finally shed light on all your absurd behavior throughout the book, and to justify and the red herrings and narrative padding! But of course, it could only be so in the classic style of a fiendish murder mystery! Why, in fact, though this is but the first case we have solved together, I have no doubt we could do the exact same thing as many as 86 more times, depending on if you count the smaller cases!""""Quite so, mon ami,"" Poirot chuckled. ""You make such a reliably dim-witted Watson!""I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the little man! Then we drank some tea and he kissed me passionately, on the mouth.","If you've read my reviews before, you know I love mystery fiction, and in particular, the classics. Agatha Christie died in 1976, and I was born the following year. Two things come to mind... (1) It's a good thing I wasn't alive when she died because I would have been so miserable to be around. (2) Since I was born just about a year later, I'm wondering if maybe a small part of her lives on... as I love her genius and her works of literature... and I can re-read her books over and over again without ever getting bored.There are tons of reviews of all her major works, and I don't need to be repetitive in my review. What I'd really try to get across is why you need to read ANY of her works, and then why I'd suggest this one:1. This was one of her first books, and I believe the first published one, in 1920, which means she was probably writing it exactly 100 years ago. And though some of the language is a little different, and it takes place with a different cultural atmosphere, the crux of the story -- its plot, is appropriate at any point in time. People don't love Christie for her beautiful language or her great ideas... yeah, she had some of those... but it's her plots and characters that stand out. And those transcend time. 2. Who else can create such a puzzle that you are constantly trying to guess what's going on? True, tons of writers today, but not 100 years ago. And even with modern writers, it's often in a suspense and thriller type of novel, where it's all about the chase. Christie was all about the calm approach to solving a murder. She didn't try to end each chapter with a big WOW and heart-wrenching scare tactic. It's simple evolution of a timeline, collections of clues, conversations with people... and then you start to see the puzzle come together. But at the last minute, you get the unexpected twist.3. With this first book, you meet Hercule Poirot, one of her two popular detectives. Poirot is annoying. He's painful. He will make you angry while you are laughing. And that's the cool part. Columbo is the best comparison I can come up with. And I'm certain Columbo was based on large part by Christie's Poirot.So why this book???????It's the first in the series. It's a prime example of why her stories work. It's the ultimate tale - a family with secrets. It takes place in the UK... the best place to visit and perhaps live. I don't live there, only visited it. :}But it's really the slow build-up of the clues that will have your mind working overtime. So... if you need a Christie stand-alone book, go to ""And Then There Were None."" If you like female investigators, choose a Miss Marple. If you like a Belgian male detective, flip a coin and pick between Murder on the Orient Express or The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Both will be a great read. But if you need to start at the beginning, go with this one to see what an author's first book looks like. Because if I didn't have my Christie... I'd be like...

One of Us Is Lying,Karen M. McManus,3.92,"What a marvelous, delectable read! There was something so addictive about this book; it felt at times distinctly young adult while also having moments that felt so well done it was beyond the stereotype of what a teenage thriller tends to be. It’s taken me 4 days just to collect my thoughts to the point that I can attempt writing a proper review, and I’m certain this will be one of the most talked about books in the YA genre this Spring/Summer season. My issues with this book were minor, and I’ll get to those later, but when I first picked up this book I knew I would enjoy it based on the description stating “Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars”, two things I love to pieces. While this was in some ways a traditional whodunnit, I believe many of the minor influences were the reason this novel reads so well.According the the books I’ve logged on Goodreads, I’ve managed to read over 700 mystery, thriller, and suspense novels. That is an overwhelming number of books that tend to be fiercely judged on their ability to provide a solid, mind-blowing twist. The reason I mention this is due to the fact that it is very difficult for me to pick up a mystery and not have it solved in the first 10% if the clues are provided; otherwise, I typically pick it up when said character is first introduced into the narrative. One of Us Is Lying is bound to be one of many fabulous novels that gets thrown into that category and is scrutinized solely by it’s ability to keep the reader guessing “whodunnit” until the big reveal. Again, I mention this because I think it would be a grave mistake for the reader to be so focused on this aspect when the book has so much more to offer! Personally, I had it figured out in the first chapter. As stated in the summary, the pieces are there for the reader to put together if they are clever enough. I applaud the author for her cleverness and storytelling abilities; there will be many readers who will be fooled by the red herrings and receive that glorious 
AHA
 moment at the big reveal. Why am I rambling on about this you ask? I really want to drive home the point of what makes this book stand out from others that are similar.The Characters. It is a rare day indeed that I find fleshed out, grounded, relatable characters that draw me in to a young adult narrative the way that these did here. My 
AHA
 moment may not have come during the big twist, but it certainly came in waves abounding throughout my experience journeying with these various high school kids. I was sure this would be another read with those stereotypical teenagers that give contemporary YA novels a bad rep; for crying out loud the stereotypes are printed on the inside of the book cover in the description! I think this was a clever move by the publisher and author; if other readers pull the same underestimation as I did, they will be more than pleasantly surprised at what they get out of this book. In referral to the wrapping up of characters and not the twist, the ending was one of the best I’ve seen in awhile. There is no gag worthy happily ever after where everyone is perfectly paired up in couples and they ride off into the sunset on their baby unicorns while the sun beats down on their pimple free faces…. No, while there are some upbeats moments, the ending is messy and real and I welcomed it whole heartedly. People made mistakes beyond the central narrative and there were consequences and some things were left open-ended in the way that makes you wonder what their eventual decisions lead to. I’m extremely pleased that the author chose to take some risky leeway with her writing direction and applaud her with a standing ovation.Alright, I said I would get to the minor issues and I kind of lied. Please don’t hate me, but there was a tiny aspect of this book that I thought I could get past, and even though I can’t discuss it outright (because these spoilers involve blowing the entire plot of the book), my conscience just wouldn’t let me finish this review without mentioning them in the broadest of terms. Again, I applaud the author for tackling some really tough issues and concerns in this book, and I don’t think she wrote anything wrong on her end. I think it’s more of an issue I’ve seen present itself across a wide number of YA books recently. Some who may be dealing with mental illness may perceive the outcome of this novel in an unrealistic way and I can see the possibility of various readers being split on their opinions of some of the content presented. I will say, I feel it was handled better in this book than in others I have read previously. As always, if you’ve read this book early or once you have a chance to read it and would like to discuss, please feel free to private message me and I’ll gladly have a respectful chat with you.This is a review I’ve been struggling to write for a few days now and I hope I’ve done it justice. There just aren’t words to describe how completely readable this book really is. McManus did such a fabulous job of making me just as interested in the individual secrets and side stories of the “Murder Club” as I was in the central mystery surrounding Simon’s death. The author had me convinced that this couldn’t possibly be her debut novel, and if this is what she has published first, I can only imagine the treats we will receive in written form from her down the road. I’m a committed fan now and I can’t wait to see what she publishes next. Highly recommended to teens, sure, but I think loads of adults are going to enjoy this one as well. There’s something really special and unique to this story that defies the boundaries of age gaps and will have me remembering it for months to come.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy; it was a pleasure to post my honest thoughts here.","Content warning: Harmful representation of sexuality and mental illness.This book was such a disappointment because I was REALLY enjoying it up until the last 3rd or so. I seriously thought this would be a 4 or 5 star read. However, upon finishing, I strongly believe that this book should not have been published as is. It's ignorant and damaging.Aside from the parts that I found harmful, the writing was very trope heavy and relied on too many stereotypes for character development. I didn't think there was anything new here. The one thing I did like about the book is that McManus did build suspense well and kept me guessing. She casts suspicion on so many characters that you start questioning everything. This would have been a good mystery if it hadn't used people's identities for shock value. This is othering. These are some 90s plot twists that I'm honestly surprised flew by a publishing team in 2017.I'm going to talk about these things in depth under the spoiler tag below because I know everyone has a different threshold for what they consider to be spoilery. I personally don't think these things should be written as spoilers, but that's how this book treats them so it's how I'm treating this review.SexualityAll the characters have secrets that come to light throughout the book and the first red flag for me was about 2/3 or so in when Cooper is revealed to be gay. This was written as if it should be scandalous and to try and shock the reader because there is a distinct moment earlier in the book where you are led to believe the person he's flirting with is a girl.Cooper's reasoning for wanting to stay closeted felt very realistic and might be relateable to some readers. It's not that his storyline has no value, I just think that sexuality shouldn't be used as a plot twist.Further harm is done when part of the plot includes Cooper being publicly outed against his will. This could definitely cause some anxiety for people who are closeted or have been forceably outed before. Be cautious.I am not gay and can't tell you how to feel about these things. I've heard from LGBTQIA+ readers who loved the depiction and others who hated it. When I hear many LGBTQIA+ reviewers I follow saying sexuality shouldn't be written as a plot twist and that storylines involving being outed can be triggering, these are the best guidelines I can go by with my reviews since I am not personally affected by it. You are allowed to feel however you feel about it. I'm just warning those who MAY be harmed by it that this is present.Mental IllnessThere are a couple of characters in the book that are said to be depressed and one of them was Simon, the boy who died. The final plot twist is that Simon wasn't murdered, but killed himself. Again, I think that some of Simon's feelings that surround his depression could be very relateable to teenagers, but I had three huge issues with how his suicide was portrayed.First, depression is villanized because Simon is portrayed as a terrorist. His main motivation was wanting the infamy of a school shooter. He wanted to cause the same amount of damage, but in a way he deemed better. Problem: Depression does not equal being a terrorist! Mental illness being portrayed as wrong and evil is such a tired depiction.Second, a side character was also said to be depressed and she was his accomplice. She framed his death on the other 4 students by planting evidence. Through her, depression is villainized once again.Third, STOP TREATING SUICIDE LIKE A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED. It's a mental illness, not sensational entertainment!Depression is something I know personally and have watched family members deal with, and how this book handled it was like a stab in the gut. Is this really what the world thinks of me? Again, not saying you have to agree with my thoughts on it, but this hurt me and affected my enjoyment of the book. I just think these twists are so tired and perpetuate stigmas against LGBTQIA+ people and people with mental illness.For those who may be hurt by the mishandling of sexuality or mental illness, I would suggest being cautious of this book. If you're a reader who is oblivious to or unhurt by bad rep, you'll probably enjoy this book going by all the shining reviews it has.Other things of note:-Bronwyn is biracial (white & Colombian).-Addy's POV is very shallow and portrays a terrible relationship and girl drama. (But she has a good growth arc.)-The drug-dealing bad boy trope is heavy.-The audiobook narrators were great at their jobs.-If you loved the book, that's great. I didn't, and this was why.","I feel like one of maybe four people in the world who just... really did not enjoy this book? I've been putting off this review for weeks because I just don't know where to start. I have so many friends who raved about this book to me, so I was so disappointed by it. These are only my opinions, and I would never dream of disrespecting anyone who disagrees with my review, so please show the same courtesy and don't hate me for what I'm about to say. ❤→ what i liked ←This is a very quick read; if I had enjoyed it, I'm sure I would've knocked it out in one sitting. As it was, it still felt like it moved pretty quickly. The main romance is fairly cute. Incredibly trope-y ""goody-two-shoes smart girl falls for the brooding bad boy!"" stuff, but, I mean, their interactions are fine, and I was rooting for them by the end of the book, which is a big plus. I would say I was more attached to the budding relationship between them than I was to any of the individual characters in this story.Nate, 'the criminal', is a very likable character. He's got a really dark and twisty back story that explains away a lot of his motives, and I definitely enjoyed his perspectives of the story the most. He just feels like a really authentic teen who's trying to muddle through a hard, screwed-up life, and I loved that about him. Whenever it was any other character's POV, I definitely found myself rushing to get back to his sections.→ what i didn't like ←This book is so problematic and most of it is NEVER challenged. First of all, can we talk about the immense amounts of slut-shaming? I could handle it if it was coming just from the characters and/or was actually being challenged consistently, but 1) it isn't challenged every time in the dialogue, and 2) the author contributes to the slut-shaming narrative regarding women cheating.We have two characters in the story who are cheaters; one is a female character, who does it one time, while drunk; the other is a male character, who carries on an emotional and physical affair for MONTHS. We spend a tremendous portion of the book focusing on the girl's one-night-stand, while the text literally does not ONCE actually name the boy for what he is: a cheater. There's no remorse shown, and there are no consequences whatsoever for him. It also seems kinda gross to me that the girl who's guilty of cheating is a ""pretty, vapid, popular girl"" type - can we please stop with these cliches?Also, can we please NOT make the only queer character in the cast a horrible character who cheats and hurts people? AND can we not make the character's coming-out scene a bigger twist than the actual murderer reveal? This book also does some serious vilifying of mental illness, but I won't get started on that rant.Beyond all of that... honestly, the writing is just not that good, and the ""twist"" is so predictable it hurts.→ final thoughts ←All in all... I almost hated this book. If it hadn't been for the quick pace and how much I enjoyed Nate, as well as his relationship with Bronwyn, I absolutely would have DNFed this. As it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book, and I will probably not be picking up any future releases from this author.———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog"

THERAPY FOR ALL OF YOU! my thoughts (mild spoilers ahead)• i ain't never seen four emotionally intelligent brothers. two of them always gotta have unaddressed trauma.• the young adult threshold for personality is in HELL. all you need to do is give your teenage main character a vaguely tragic past, enough stubbornness to allow her to mildly bump heads with love interests every once in a while, a weakness for hot emotionally unavailable rich boys, and a best friend of color to carry things (for flavor).• not this billionaire secretly surveilling a low income teenage girl for most of her adolescence while she's struggling to stay afloat and literally living out of her car? taking and saving photos of her without her knowledge? and hoarding his wealth all the while? while she's barely scraping by? until the day he dies and finally decides—now that he no longer needs that wealth—it'll all go to her in exchange for using her as a pawn in his family's trauma olympics?

Yes! Except, no. The thing is, if you're going to promise me puzzles and riddles, you'd better deliver. And The Inheritance Games fell way short.Avery is your standard teenager trying to get through high school when she receives news that billionaire Tobias Hawthorne has died and left her almost his entire fortune. The only stipulation is that she must move into his mansion and live there for one year. When she arrives, she meets the enigmatic family, including his four handsome grandsons. But it's all rather awkward since the old devil disinherited them all. Soon though, she realizes that he's got one more trick up his sleeve and it's up to her to figure it out.At first, this story reminded me of Knives Out, probably my favorite whodunnit film of all time. They both have the wealthy old man kicking the bucket and leaving his fortune to an outsider, along with a mystery/puzzle to solve. But that's where the similarities between the two end, and unfortunately, so did my enjoyment.At the very least, I expected the majority of this book to be about the puzzle that Avery is supposed to solve. But that was such a small part, and it was unnecessarily convoluted. Reading about her searching through every book and desk and tree on the property doesn't really quicken my pulse with excitement. And the end result is so lame, I forgot it almost as soon as I read it.Instead, the majority of this book is spent on very immature interpersonal drama between Avery and the ten other teenagers in here (the four brothers, her sister and her sister's ex, her only friend, and three other girls). If that sounds like a lot of people, I assure you, it was.None of the characters have real personalities, so I had a hard time keeping straight who was who. Especially among the four brothers, it felt like they were all approximately the same person, just slightly apart in age. They all spoke in the same ostentatious way and all seemed to have varying degrees of crushes on Avery.In fact, the romances in here really confused me. It seems like every teenager was in some sort of romantic entanglement/flirtation with every other teenager. There were so many implied love triangles and quadrangles, I really just didn't get it. Why is all this in here, other than to fluff out the pages?The other thing that really got on my nerves is the dialogue. It's somehow both bland and pretentious. It's basic as can be, but presented as if it's some sort of witty repartee worth savoring. Then to further rub salt in the wound, random dull sentences are treated like epiphanies, italicized and repeated over and over, just so the reader wouldn't miss it when they come across it for the tenth time.Unfortunately, this was a case of overpromising and underdelivering. The best part of the book was the premise and initial pages. As I read on, the mind-numbing dialogue and YA melodrama/romance between all the characters really grated on me. Add to that the underwhelming conclusion, and I'm sorry to say that this is really not for me. Maybe if I were still a teenager, I would enjoy this more. But that's too many decades in the past for me to remember now.As an aside, if you've never seen Knives Out, I totally recommend it. It's absolutely fabulous and actually lives up to the premise. Imagine that.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle,Stuart Turton,3.79,"CLICK HERE for a Booktube Video about:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go - doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!
The Written Review
 Read this one for TCE book club! 
 If this isn’t hell, the devil is surely taking notes.
Lord and Lady Hardcastle are throwing a ""party"" at Blackheath, their crumbling British mansion.This so-called-party takes place on the anniversary of their son's murder (19 years ago), includes the exact same guests as it did so many years ago.And, during the night, trusts will be violated, truths will be exposed and above all, their daughter, Evelyn Hardcastle will be murdered.Aidan Bishop, along with two others,  are in competition to be the first to discover Evelyn Hardcastle's murderer.
Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded.
Bishop relives the night of Evelyn's murder for eight days, and each day he is in a different body and has a new chance to find the murderer. 
Life doesn’t always leave you a choice in how you live it.
The first day, Bishop wakes up in Dr. Sebastian Bell's body, without a clue as to where he is and what he is supposed to do.The second day, Bishop wakes up in the butler's body...but ""past-Bishop"" is also inhabiting Bell's body. Which leads to a lot of confusion and surprise.The third day, there's current-Bishop, past-Bishop and past-past-Bishop....well you get the point. Each day Bishop adds another ""character"" under his belt. He gets eight bodies, and eight days, to piece together the mystery. The two others who are in competition with Bishop are unknown to him and are also inhabiting bodies (though, unlike him, they cannot swap and every ""day"" their memories reset). They are all racing to find out the murderer, because whoever can figure out this mystery is the winner.And the winner? 
The winner gets to escape.

How lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?
This book was confusing in the best way possible.I could barely write my summary - there's just so many layers of complexity and betrayals and everything.So effing impressed. I was wholly ensnared by the mystery - I hardly knew what to think or where to look - but it was such a fun and wild ride that I didn't care.Aiden Bishop was a wonderfully fleshed-out character and Turton did a particularly excellent job with the various bodies that Bishop possessed.In particular, I loved how each body Bishop possessed would begin to influence him. When he was Dr. Sebastian Bell, Bishop was meek, under the butler's influence Bishop became moralistic and so on. It was fascinating to watch how that played out.The only thing that threw me slightly was the end. The build to the climax and the ending were superb...but the actual grand reveal was a bit of a letdown.I honestly don't know what I as expecting, just something a bit ""more"" - if that makes any sense...All I know is that this is an author to watch. 
I cannot wait to see what Turton writes next!!

We are never more ourselves than when we think people aren’t watching.
Audiobook CommentsRather well-read, a thoroughly enjoyable book to listen to!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads","This is one of the most deliciously bonkers and intensely fucked up stories that I’ve ever read—and I loved it.Our narrator wakes up in a dripping forest, with nothing but the shade of an old unnameable fear, and the eerie sensation of being followed, an invisible gaze locked on his back. He has no recollection of who he is and no notion of how he got there. He can only remember one name: Anna.He later learns that his name is Aiden Bishop and that he’s trapped inside a stranger’s body. A masked figure curtly informs him that he must unveil a murder disguised as to not look like one if he wants to earn his release, and he must do so by reliving the day of the murder eight times, but each morning he will wake up in the body of a different stranger. If he fails to uncover the name of the would-be murderer, he will return to the first day, memory mopped clean, and start all over again as he has apparently already done innumerable times before. Matters are made worse when Aiden realizes he isn’t the only one washed to this strange shore: two other people are also ensnarled inside this time loop, and a knife-wielding Footman is out for their blood. Quickly Aiden realizes that he, Anna, and the anonymous rivals are pieces on the game board with everything at stake. Including their lives. 
“How lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?” 
So. As I said: it’s bonkers, alright.The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a dazzling, mind-bending murder mystery… without a murder. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever read: a brilliantly balanced knife's edge of a book—unfolding gradually, with secrets unveiled as more lies are told. The whole experience of reading this book felt to me like an elaborate lie, like some made-up fantasyland I was locked in for a set number of hours a day. And like Aiden, I was constantly caught between another dead end and another lead. So many pieces of the story but how the hell do they fit together?The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle might be focused on the story of Aiden Bishop but the stories of many others are caught up in the wheel of his, and as that wheel turns, so do these many intertwined lives and fates. The narration lingers in the memories and lives of each “host”, dipping in and out of them like toes in a pool. The book makes you question what you know about these characters, their lives and their secrets. Everyone is unreliable, everything is questionable. Aiden’s very sense of self is threatened to be overruled by the personalities of his hosts, most of which were nasty pieces of work: more than slightly sexist, selfish, mean, manipulative, abusive, more often than not physical and moral cowards—yet still compelling even when you can’t bring yourself to like them even a little bit.In inventiveness and richness of ideas, few books in this genre can compare. I was continuously impressed by the novel’s sense of scope, the minute turnings of characters and their choices and how those ripples affect other players, by the hints strewn like breadcrumbs throughout the narrative and the puzzle pieces that were always moving around. This was genuinely brilliant and so intricately crafted and I’m still REELING from it. The ending was simply insane, and I was left astounded into an awed slow-clap at everything the author has accomplished. When I flipped the last page, all I could do was stare at the wall and ask, with the kind of eloquence and poise perfectly befitting the situation: ""What the fuck did I just read?""","Well, yikes.Here are the things I knew about this book before starting it:1) Its original title (and current UK title) was The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, which, in pure coincidence, is very very similar to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and was therefore changed in the US. (I think this is awesome.)2) It’s a murder mystery with quite possibly the coolest conceit of any book ever. (I think this is awesome.)3) It’s teeming with gratuitous fat shaming. (I think this is one of the less awesome things I've ever heard in my life.)Add to that list that the style is extremely overbearing and unyielding over the course of 480 pages (which feels like many more), and you have my list of major takeaways from this reading experience.Let’s go in order.NUMBER 1: TITLE THINGWell, we basically already covered this.But it says a lot that I still think this is the most interesting thing about this book, and it has nothing to do with its contents.NUMBER 2: PLOT THINGThe idea for this book is SO COOL. Which is why it’s extra lame that I found the first 300-ish pages to be very, very boring, and also found the Big Reveal to be - while not predictable - also boring, and generally speaking was very bored by this whole thing.Also, the fact that the conceit of this book is what it is (meaning, a guy wakes up in a different person’s body every day with the task of solving the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle) means there must be Magic involved.Cool! Who doesn’t love magic?Um, apparently this author, because this Magical World goes largely unexplained and then is halfheartedly told at one point but is clearly not the Main Issue.Which is extra, extra lame.NUMBER 3: FATPHOBIA THINGReading this author say that he did not intend to shame fat people in this book is the stupidest, dumbest, most useless excuse for blatant hatred I’ve ever heard.It’s actually worse if the fat shaming in this book is not intended, because the idea that someone could go around subliminally thinking things as hateful as this is absurd. The way the fat character in this is written - traitless but for the fact that he is very fat, and therefore lonely and abhorrent and disgusting - is so awful. It’s to the point of being basically unreadable.This book got better towards the end, but I still wish I had DNFed it at this point.NUMBER 4: STYLE THINGI could tell within a couple dozen pages that this style - extremely overwrought, extremely overbearing, and extremely present for the whole book - was not going to work for me.It never did.Bottom line: The only cool thing about this book was the idea behind it, and everything about the execution was a major bummer.-------------pre-reviewwell, i didn't hate this as much as i expected.what a rave review.rtc / 2 stars-------------42 pages into this and already brutally sick of the style. YET ANOTHER PROMISING READING EXPERIENCE"
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,Agatha Christie,4.27,"I went into this book with a bit of an attitude. Roger Ackroyd is the only Agatha Christie book featured on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, and I was skeptical about the List's claim that this was the only Christie book worth reading. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I think the List is right on this one. At least a little - I'm definitely not suggesting that you should read this book and then never pick up a Christie novel ever again, but if you find yourself in a situation where you're going to spend a month on a desert island and can only bring one book, and the only books you've been offered are from the Agatha Christie canon, you should pick this one. The ending (which I will not discuss in explicit detail for fear of spoilers) is what makes this a 5-star book. Let me assure you: you will not guess who the murderer is. Never ever ever. When the murderer is revealed, you will not believe. When the murderer goes on to explain his/her actions, you will continue to not believe it. Only by rereading certain important passages will you start to realize that the answer was in front of you all the time, and you couldn't see it. It's a testament to Christie's skill as a writer that this is accomplished. And, having now read a Miss Marple mystery, I'm going to choose a side: I'm officially Team Hercule. He is silly and self-centered and ridiculous and funny and all I want to do is pinch his cheeks and then go sit in a cafe with him and eat croissants. My favorite part of the book is when Poirot makes his grand entrance. The narrator, Dr. Sheppard, is in his garden when someone throws a vegetable marrow over the wall. A second later, the doctor's new neighbor pokes his ""egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes"" over the garden wall and attempts to explain himself:""I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense. For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I enrage myself with the marrows. I send them to promenade themselves - alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.""","Even among Agatha Christie's amazing murder mysteries, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd stands out as one of the most extraordinary. I first read this more than 20 years ago in high school, and was so stunned by the ending that I remembered it through all these years. Recently, I wanted to reread it and see if I still love it just as much, even though I already know the ending going in. And sure enough, it's just as brilliant as I remembered.This story has all the characteristics that make an Agatha Christie whodunnit remarkable—a confounding murder, a small but seemingly unlikely list of suspects, an abundance of clues and red herrings everywhere, and an ending that will leave you amazed. It was really fun to revisit this story that has stood out in my memory for so long. In many ways, Agatha Christie was a pioneer in her genre, and this story is one example where you can see her influence in the books that have come since then. For me, she remains the undisputed queen of mystery. I only wish I can scrub my memory so I can enjoy this story over and over again.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Murder on the Orient ExpressDeath on the Nile~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","The Murder or Roger Ackroyd is one of the most well-known mysteries written by Agatha Christie and the only one to be featured in the 1001 Books To Read Before You Die list. After having read it I understand why it is so well praised. As with all her mysteries, it leaves you guessing until the end who the killers is and in this particular case, the way the murderer was unraveled was particularly interesting. Sadly for me, I already knew who the killer was as I accidently found out from an audio course on Crime and mystery novels. Because of that, a large part of the book’s appeal was lost for me. However, I can still appreciate the unique way this novel was thought out. I don’t want to say anymore so I do not spoil anything for the ones that still haven’t read it. If you enjoy Agatha Christie’s novels this one is a must."
The Thursday Murder Club,Richard Osman,3.87,"Unpopular opinion alert... but I thought that this book was kind of terrible.It has a nice concept...sort of. It's partially set in a retirement village, and we are quickly introduced to a lot of quirky characters who have organised themselves into a 'Thursday Murder Club' in order to solve (solve? Discuss? Take a really weird illegal interest in?) crimes that happened a long time ago. So far, reasonably OK. When a real murder takes place adjacent to the community, the gang decide to throw themselves into investigating it for real, and this is what a majority of the plot is taken up with. As a concept, this is all fine. But  this isn't it . Richard Osman then feels the need to introduce us to fifty other characters for, seemingly, no reason whatsoever.The narrative jumps about so much it's difficult to remember anyone's name, much less become invested in anyone's individual story. I've seen a lot of people saying that actually the murder plot is totally secondary to all of the intricacies of the relationships between the characters in the retirement village: this would have been fine, but not enough time is actually spent exploring any of these relationships. We get that East End Ron now prefers wine to beer, and that there are some sweet moments between Joyce and her daughter, but, honestly? That was about it. It was all very surface-level, and the fact that there's a new chapter every 2 pages from a different character's point of view makes it all feel disjointed, like flicking through the TV channels really quickly without actually getting more than 2 seconds of dialogue every time.The book is sold as a murder mystery, so let's discuss that, because Richard Osman doesn't really feel the need to. It's a weird and meandering investigation that we get from multiple sides: we get the Murder Club's version of events, then we get a bumbling police detective's version of events, then we get what actually happened. This could have been interesting, but it was left so flat. We get one member of the Murder Club telling us that she's actually definitely worked out who the real killer was and isn't this great? But find out what we do about it in the next book! The actual resolution of the murder plot is such an afterthought though, and more weight seems to be given to our bumbling cop's newfound romance with (weirdly) his junior police officer's mum. Was this necessary? No. Was it sweet? Not really, it was just yet another character added in incredibly superficially for no particularly purpose other than to say that she's allergic to dogs, and possibly to subvert the expectations of everyone who thought the older cop was going to turn out to be creepily involved with his subordinate. Great.The whole book felt incredibly gimmicky. Even in the acknowledgements, Richard Osman says that he got the idea by visiting a retirement village and, gasp, discovering that old people are interesting! So that was basically the entire plot: people have secrets, everyone you might like has probably done something awful, the premise isn't important and we'll do a deep character analysis but not  actually  go that deeply into anything, and leave everything nicely resolved (or not).I was basically really glad to finish this book. Wouldn't re-read. Wouldn't recommend. Would struggle to score it higher than a 1/5.","Celebrity writers can be a hit and miss experience, so it was with trepidation that I approached Richard Osman's quintessentially offbeat British character driven crime fiction debut, but I need not have worried, it's a belter, with its understated charm, humour and wit that beguiles. Set in Kent, four sprightly, remarkable agile, and energetic elderly folk exercise their considerable brain power into the solving of cold case murders from police files secretly acquired by the undisputed leader of the group, Elizabeth, a woman to be reckoned with, with her mysterious and shadowy background. The organising Elizabeth has a powerful and wide ranging network that she can call on, one that the police might envy. The quiet, sensible and overlooked Joyce, an ex-nurse, is a recent arrival to the exclusive luxury retirement village, that include many residents formerly at the top of their varied professions. She soon finds herself recruited to the Thursday Murder Club (TMC), and it is through her Journal we learn of the members activities and meetings, oiled by considerable partaking of wine and her delicious baking. Ibrahim, a retired psychiatrist, a logistics and details man, and Ron, a union man that used to be famously portrayed as Red Ron in the media, are the other members of the club. PC Donna de Freitas, is a recent transplant from the London Met and, to put it mildly, she would rather be solving murders than living the boredom of her current reality as she gives a security talk to the TMC, only to have her agenda overturned by the bunch of wily, manipulative and sly members. When the murder of Tony Curran is discovered, the TMC gear themselves up to solve the murder, willing to use any advantage they can engineer, cross any line, and venture into forbidden territory where the police cannot go. They use their influence to get Donna on the murder team run by the lonely and overweight DCI Chris Hudson, to gain access to police information, willing to trade what the TMC discover with Donna and Chris, although they often only do so at a their discretion and at a time of their choosing.It is the diverse characters that Osman creates and develops, and his tight plotting with the numerous secrets and their reveals, along with the comic touches, that makes this an entertaining and delightful read. This makes a wonderful break from the dark and grisly fare of much of the crime fiction and mystery genre, and whilst the connection between our intrepid elderly sleuths and the police might require a suspension of disbelief, it works beautifully. Obviously when it comes to the elderly, medical issues, physical decline, loneliness, grief and loss are going to play an integral part of their stories. If you are looking for fun, entertainment, and a thoughtful, intelligent, offbeat and engaging mystery, then this is highly likely to appeal. In the meantime, I look forward to the next in what promises to be a stellar crime series. Many thanks to Penguin UK for an ARC.","After a certain age, you can pretty much do whatever takes your fancy. No one tells you off, except for your doctors and your children.
The Thursday Murder Club meets every Thursday (hence the name) at Coopers Chase, a peaceful retirement community where nothing much happens. That is, until a murder occurs within its idyllic community, and four of its septuagenarian residents decide to stick their noses in and solve it themselves.I was immediately taken with the quirky and loveable cast of characters. The senior citizens made me chuckle with their sassy antics and their unapologetic zest for life. The gentle humor strikes just the right balance, without coming across as too flippant or cheesy. I also adored the detectives in here, with their protectiveness of these septuagenarians and their good-natured acceptance of their often questionable behaviors.As for the mystery itself, it started out really strong. I was completely bought in during the first half, playing arm chair detective while following along with each clue and red herring. But then it kind of became convoluted and confusing. It seems like the book tried to insinuate guilt on every single character, one by one. It was fun for the first one or two, thinking that I've been duped, but it quickly became tedious. Thankfully, the ending wrapped everything up in a satisfying, if long-winded, way.Overall, this was a really entertaining read, in large part due to its cast of sweet and funny characters. I'm glad this is the first of what looks to be a series, and I can't wait to read more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2. The Man Who Died Twice#3. The Bullet That Missed#4.

The Cuckoo's Calling,Robert Galbraith,3.89,"Feb 3rd 2014 - Extra things you should know: 1) This is a negative review. If you are looking for reviews that confirm what you are already certain of (that JKR can do no wrong) here are some examples of positive reviews for you - 1, 2, 3. 2) I used some Mary Poppins gifs to make my point in this review. It seemed funny at the time. If you find MP gifs stupid/annoying/beneath you, then please feel free to go to the reviews I linked before. 3) I will no longer reply to comments saying I am stupid or didn't get it. I will no longer reply to insults of any kind or condescending suggestions that I read the book again. If you're tempted to write something like this, save both of us some time and read the previous comments for my answers to people like you. I have way too many unwatched episodes of Law & Order to entertain trolls any longer.4) I'm sorry to all the people who have been kind and respectful, whether they agreed with me or not. You can just ignore these points.____________________________Things you should know: 1) Ms Rowling filled my childhood and early teen years with magic. I love Harry Potter and I confess to only adding this book after I found out she was the author. 2) I did not go into this with the intention to compare it to Harry Potter. I did not expect magic or wizards and I fully anticipated this being very different to the HP books. 3) I have read and enjoyed many mystery/crime novels in the past. My favourites being by Tana French and Gillian Flynn. So, there was no reason why I couldn't have enjoyed this book simply because it wasn't magical Potterland. But I didn't and, after putting a lot of thought into this, I think I finally understand why.Here's the sad truth: I can't stand Rowling's writing when she writes for adults. I actually find it painful to read. Let's be clear from the beginning, I started and never finished The Casual Vacancy because the opening didn't grab me and there was something about it - something which I couldn't put my finger on - that made it an effort to get through. A certain style to the writing which didn't agree with me. I thought perhaps it was a one-off because I'd read all her other works and never had a problem with her writing style. That's why I jumped at the chance to try another adult book by Rowling and sort out what was evidently a bout of silliness on my part. What this book did give me was an answer to why neither of Rowling's adult books worked for me.Rowling writes in an unusual manner. It's not unique to her work for adults, Harry Potter has it too, but the effect had on both is very different. Rowling's style of writing, including the dialogue between characters, is formal to the point of being old-fashioned. Part of me wants to compare it to Austen but I'm cautious of doing so because of the amount of people (usually including myself) who might read that as a compliment. Rowling's formal style doesn't work, for me, when using it in an adult mystery and pairing it with profanity and grisly murders. It feels out of place and weighs down each page with tedious descriptions that use too many awkward similes, metaphors and adjectives. ""...face the colour of corned beef...""""...the snow fell with soft fingertip plunks...""""...long-snouted cameras...""Her descriptions all felt a bit off to me. And I particularly didn't like the unsophisticated use of big words. It's like when inexperienced indie authors go crazy with thesaurus.com, using clunky words like ""exacerbated"" and ""exorbitant"" in casual sentences that don't benefit from it. The characters in this book never check the time or look at their watches, they ""consult"" their watches. Think I'm being picky? Try reading whole pages where every sentence replaces the obvious words with complex ones and see how far you get without your brain starting to scream. And it felt like every single noun had at least one adjective before it. Not only that, but Rowling repeats similar adjectives when referring to the objects again. In one sentence, we are told she climbed the ""steel stairs"" and in the next she's continuing up the ""metal stairs"". WHY???? And also WHYYYYYY???Another example of Rowling's old-fashioned style is her frequent use of expressions like ""oh my!"" and ""goodness!"", expressions I'm sure some of you will recognise from Harry Potter characters. What is this? It's like Mary Poppins or Little Women or, I don't know, Little House on the Prairie. And maybe it works fine in all of those, same as it works fine in Harry Potter, but none of those also had a side-helping of profanity and very adult themes. They do all, however, share the formal language style.And while I think people were silly to say things about The Casual Vacancy like ""ohmigod this had, like, noooooo magic and even fewer dark lords"" when Rowling clearly said it was an adult mystery book and I wanted to say to those silly people:I still think it's entirely relevant to compare the two when looking at Rowling's writing style and the reason why sometimes it works and sometimes it really doesn't. The formal tone with simplistic language - like in Harry Potter - is okay, but dense descriptions and over-complicated sentences made it hard work and tedious in this book. It's like a very formal letter with the occasional random swear word thrown in. And it doesn't work. Not for me, anyway. The style simply doesn't fit the content; there's swearing and murders and people rescuing others by grabbing their breasts...I'm not even going to talk about the story beyond saying I found it a standard mystery that could have been good if I'd not had these other reasons for not liking it. The killer is not hard to guess for anyone familiar with crime mysteries but that isn't usually what I care about most in crime mysteries anyway. Plus, in this case, I'm just too blinded by my dislike for the writing. *sigh* I think it's fair to say that I'm finally done trying to enjoy Rowling's adult books.P.S. Yes, I did get a little overexcited when I googled Mary Poppins gifs.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr","Dull & tedious. I was frustrated with the style of writing. There’s no action. It’s all conversation. I wanted it to be over.COURTROOM STYLE CONVERSATIONS - TELLING NOT SHOWING:Private eye Strike is investigating a death. Throughout the book Strike has long conversations with many different characters. It felt like a courtroom, asking witnesses 30 or more questions one right after the other. Many of these were discussions about what “might have happened. For example “I don’t think he would have done it because he was...” “It could have been this. But assume it’s not, then what about that?” “Why couldn’t it have been a letter to...” All these conversations are people “telling” about the past with their own subjective assumptions, conclusions, and some lies. I’d prefer Strike actively doing things to discover clues and some interesting, unexpected, or scary action.Even Robin, my favorite character, she went to Oxford to investigate something. We should have watched her and seen her interacting with people. Instead Robin “tells” what she learned to Strike afterwards. Like in the first paragraph, she is answering a bunch of questions about her past activity.The author used the word “had” a lot - more “telling” not showing.NO CLUES TO THE READER UNTIL THE TELL-ALL AT THE END:There are no clues until the last fourth of the book. Then there are a few clues but they don’t mean anything to the reader. For example one character said he noticed drops of water on the floor. I had no idea what that meant until Strike does his “tell all” at the end where he explains the long complicated story of what happened, who lied and why, what caused the water drops, etc. I prefer mysteries where the reader learns some clues along the way that mean something.ROBIN IS THE BEST PART:The best part was the beginning. I really enjoyed the character Robin, Strike’s temporary assistant. She shows up on her first day just before a new client arrives. She asks Strike if he and the client would like coffee or tea. Strike says yes without thinking. There is no coffee or tea, but she brings it, and Strike has no idea where she got it. A few times he calls her Sandra without thinking. That relationship was fun. Robin has great initiative and ideas. And she does some neat things. But she is only a small part of the story.ENDING NOT CLEAR TO ME:I didn’t understand “why” John hired Strike. This was answered, but the answer didn’t feel right.SWEARING LANGUAGE:Strike has a long conversation with Evan who used the f-word every other sentence. I was tired of hearing it. It was a long conversation. Other characters used the f-word less frequently which didn’t bother me as much.NARRATOR:The narrator Robert Glenister was good. But I grew tired of the British accent he used for many characters. “Look what I got” sounds like “Loo wha I goh.” He was probably being accurate, but it was not easy listening for long periods of time.AUTHOR:J.K. Rowling wrote this under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 15 hrs and 54 mins. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: I didn’t recall any, but Ernesto corrected me saying there were a few lines by Guy Some. Number of sex scenes: one, referred to no details. Setting: current day London area, England. Book copyright: 2013. Genre: mystery.","(B+) 79% | GoodNotes: A prototype yet to find its footing; its complex, interview-heavy plot poker-faces all clues until a bursting end reveal."
The Summer I Ate the Rich,"Maika Moulite, Maritza Moulite",3.40,"She did not, in fact, eat the rich.I really, really wanted to like this. It had an amazing start, with a very visceral, repulsive scene with Brielle cooking cow brain egg scramble for her mother, while resisting the urge to eat the brain raw. If I had to describe this scene in food terms, it was well-seasoned and extremely flavorful. 10/10. Take all my money.But then everything after that?Mild, with seasoning that was barely there that you had to pay close attention to actually discern any type of flavor. Man, what a letdown. The summary and title promised a lot, but it was like I read a different story. I thought that this would be BIPOC female Hannibal; it was anything but. The only people eating the rich were the rich themselves. And even then, it was in a ""blink, and you'll miss it"" kinda way. I wouldn't even consider this horror. There are actual YA horror novels that really dive deep into the genre, so I know that this book could've stretched its limits. I couldn't be more disappointed.I wanted to appreciate the story for its insights into wealth inequity and living in poverty, but even then, it was pretty much just a simplified version of these topics. Every talking point came out of the University of TikTok, Department of Sociology. If you're chronically online, you've seen these breakdowns. I wish the book talked more about specific situations that only a person living in poverty would've experienced, like how receiving Medicaid involves the government scrutinizing every tiny facet of your financials to determine if you're poor enough. Iykyk (unfortunately).Brielle's zonbi powers barely factored into the story until the ending, where it felt like a deus ex machina and like the authors remembered that she was actually a zonbi and could do something that wasn't just thirsting for human blood and flesh (and even those scenes were few and far between).And honestly, the one thing that took me out was when Brielle received health insurance for her summer internship, and that she could add her mother to it. The American in me was so confused and taken aback that I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I wish it worked that way, but like Childish Gambino said, ""This is America.""Overall, this was a decent YA read. I appreciated the Haitian immigrant/child of immigrants angle, but other than that, this novel definitely didn't deliver on the promise of its premise.Thank you to Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR) and NetGalley for this arc.","3.5⭐️The authors really said, “Let’s shed light on the immigrant experience, but make it zombies!” HA! I love it.😝 What’s even more interesting is that it’s not the typical zombies we’re used to. oh no no no. it leans more into the original concept rooted in Haitian culture… the more you know, right?Unfortunately, that’s kind of where my excitement ends. This is one of those stories where you think, “I appreciate the message or messages,” but I still found myself wondering what kind of story it was supposed to be by the time I finished.Now, going into this, I wasn’t expecting to take it too seriously. The blurb gave me “fun ride” energy, and I was totally down to just go with the flow. But even with that mindset, I still wanted something more from the story. The portrayal of the immigrant child experience was done well. Definitely relatable, not just for me but for many others too. But beyond that? The other parts of the stories….I kind of got the point… kind of didn’t?I did enjoy the main character, though! She’s definitely a quirky one, and her unpredictable actions kept me intrigued. Her dreams and aspirations were beautiful, and the relationships she builds throughout the story were genuinely heartwarming. And of course, her dynamic with her mom was the emotional thread that kept me invested enough to stick with it.Big thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the ALC in exchange for my honest review!","In case you haven't noticed, there's a cabal of millionaires and billionaires trying to ruin the planet, and make everyone of its denizens as miserable as possible, so as far as I'm concerned, there aren't enough AWFUL THINGS in the universe that can befall these people. Eating them would be doing the world a favor, though I suspect Elon would taste worse than lutefisk left to rot three weeks in the trunk of a Cybertruck. Trump, however, roasted slowly on a rotating spit, might prove to be quite succulent. (And, yes, he WILL have a golden apple in his mouth.)This is not, in my opinion, a horror novel. Our heroine Brielle is not out there slicing, dicing, and sauteing the one percent, though she does manage to get revenge on them that done 'er mother (and multitude of others) wrong. I was not a fan of the extremely implausible romance, nor of the Haitian muses. On the plus side, I liked all of the characters who actually had to work for a living, AND the food sounds AMAZING, though the recipe for Brielle's ""special ingredient"" is the only one includedI'll give this one four stars even though it was not the book I wanted it to be. The writing is strong, and the authors show promise of even better things to come. I can't wait to see what they cook up next. Boiled Bezos with a julienne of vegetables might hit the spot . . . Thanks to NetGalley and Farrar, Straus and Giroux for the read."
Eat the Ones You Love,Sarah Maria Griffin,3.67,is there a singing sadistic dentist in this too?,"I listened to the audiobook version and I'm very glad I did. I thought the narrators were great and added a lot to the quality of the book, by giving more depth to the characters and adding a touch of humour. The story of the creepy stalker killer plant is really unsettling, and the choice of setting it in a dying mall is a brilliant idea. Honestly just after finishing this book I'm not sure how to describe exactly my feelings about it, but a creepy vibe remains, in a very good way. Thank you MacMillan audio for this opportunity!","Dublin-based author and poet Sarah Maria Griffin’s unsettling story is closer to weird fiction than conventional horror. Although her setting of Woodbine Crown a crumbling retail complex, inspired by Donaghmede shopping centre close to where Griffin grew up, gives it a distinctly gothic flavour – demonstrated in the emphasis on this labyrinthine, haunted, decaying space. The narrator’s known only as Baby, a monstrous creature, ostensibly a sentient plant able to tap into the consciousness of the people it comes into contact with. But it’s not really organic rather something otherworldly, almost Lovecraftian, that’s crept through a crack in the fabric of space and time. Its desires, its goals are inextricably tied to florist Neve whose tiny shop is based in the centre, although creeping gentrification threatens its future existence. Neve is reeling from a break-up with girlfriend Jen when she meets Shell who’s equally adrift. Shell takes a job as Neve’s assistant a stopgap intended to help her get back on track after a failed relationship closely followed by redundancy. However, Shell’s overwhelming attraction to Neve causes Shell to jettison her plans in hope of a shared future. But Shell hasn’t reckoned with Baby’s insatiable needs and obsessive manipulations which have already resulted in a series of mysterious disappearances. Griffin worked in retail for close to a decade and once trained as a florist which grounds her narrative in reality. A reality which encompasses a critique of Dublin itself, the communities being swept away, the local gathering places purged then replaced by a series of barren, luxury buildings. Shell’s situation and that of the people around her encapsulates the issues around class, the failure of social mobility, precarity and urban alienation, that Griffin perceives as an inescapable feature of Ireland’s contemporary social landscape. And, although Griffin refuses any notion of Baby as metaphor, her malevolent narrator conjures visions of vengeful nature, of fractured eco-systems, a wider world that’s horribly out of balance. There are times when Griffin’s story falters, it’s slow-moving and could probably be trimmed back without losing any of its force. But its flaws felt relatively minor simply because the writing’s so incredibly fluid and hypnotic, overflowing with striking images and arresting passages. Although, be warned, it’s not a book for anyone seeking tidy resolutions or overarching explanations. Thanks to Netgalley and publisher Titan for an ARC"
The Cut,C.J.  Dotson,3.15,"Ugh, I’m so bummed about this.This horror book started off so promising!!! I flew through the first 70 pages so quick and I was so invested. It had all the creepy atmosphere, I love the haunted hotel atmosphere, I love that we’re following a single mother who is fleeing from an abusive situation and she’s also pregnant herself with another child on the way. She’s doing whatever she can to protect her little girl, and getting a job at this hotel is all she can do right now. I loved the set up of this book, it was reminding me of some of my favorite horror books like Lock Every Door and Nestlings. The owner of the hotel starts acting shady, strange occurrences happen, the residents who live at the hotel are acting weird, and she keeps hearing noises in the hotel, like slurping sounds and splashing sounds coming from the tubs. It had great creepy vibes~But this book got very repetitive in a lot of ways. The way she kept calling her daughter “stinker” all the time was very annoying. And a lot of the conversations in this book felt so repetitive. I thought the first 50% was so intriguing but then the second half of the book got sooooo cheesy. The ideas in this book were cool, but the execution was not well done at all, and I found myself losing interest and skimming a lot in the end. All the potential was there for this book to be great, but it really lost me in the second half, which is such a bummer!!Thanks to the publisher for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review!","Oh, this was an interesting read…I enjoyed going on this creepy, weird journey with Sadie as she essentially starts a new life after escaping her abusive partner. Knowing her situation, I was hooked and curious to see how things would play out for her. As the story went on, the paranormal elements started to show up more and more, not super scary, but definitely eerie. What I appreciated most was Sadie’s growth by the end, especially considering how horribly people had treated her throughout her life. By the end, everything was revealed. Nothing totally mind-blowing, but still surprising enough. I think with paranormal stories, it’s harder for me to be shocked because anything can be explained away by the “it’s paranormal” card. Still, it was a fun ride!","**3.5-stars rounded up**After fleeing an abusive relationship, Sadie Miles, with her toddler, Izzy, in tow, ends up at the L’Arpin Hotel, a historic property on the edge of Lake Eerie. She's not there for rest and relaxation though, she's there for a job. When she's offered a position as a housekeeper, which includes a free room at the hotel, she jumps at the offer. She's beyond desperate.We follow Sadie as she tries to navigate her new circumstance, having to do things that make her uncomfortable, such as leaving Izzy alone with an elderly woman she just met, so that she can get her work done.It's not just those necessary actions that are making her uncomfortable though, there's a lot around the hotel that is odd; including, but not limited to, the people.Individuals go missing, and there's definitely something in the water, or the pipes, or food. The higher-ups seem to be covering-up, but what? And what about the man from the power plant, always yelling and carrying on, like she's done something to him. What is going on here?Sadie, like many great Horror characters before her, isn't willing to let any of this stuff go. She's determined to figure out the truth behind the hotel, even if she needs to put herself in peril in order to do so.I had fun with this one. The Cut has a great set-up, and it did succeed at keeping me guessing and compelled to move forward with the unsettling narrative. It reminded me of one of those Creature Feature movies from the late-70s/mid-80s, that had like ants that had grown to the size of houses and ate entire towns.Were they super logical? No. Did they keep you entertained on a rainy Saturday afternoon? Absolutely. This is the vibe I got and I'm not complaining about it. This is solid B-Horror, and don't take that as an insult, because it's not. I love B-Horror. It's pure entertainment, that doesn't take itself too seriously. It tells a story, gives you thrills, chills, and keeps you at the edge of your seat.I will say, Sadie's daughter, Izzy, drove me absolutely nuts. I would have enjoyed this even more if she hadn't been in it. I know that seems mean, but it is what it is. Overall, though, this was a fun ride. It had some issues, but at the end of the day, I didn't really care. I actually Buddy Read this and it was a fun one to try to guess what was really happening. Which by the way, I was no where near guessing.Thank you, St. Martin's Press and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copies to read and review. I highly recommend the audio format if you have it available to you. The narration was a great fit for the tone of the story!"
Polybius,Collin Armstrong,3.54,"Polybius by Collin Armstrong is the fictionalized account of an urban legend about a 1981 arcade game that was, in fact, a US government-run experiment that backfired. Polybius allegedly produced intense psychoactive and addictive effects on whoever played it and while it is an urban legend, you still find lengthy posts on the Internet by people who said they played it. After reading this book, I went down the rabbit hole and found pictures of an arcade machine and a long-ass video about it (link). Honestly, reading this was FIRE. And falling into the rabbit hole of the urban legend made it even better. If you like Black Mirror and video games, this book is a must.Polybius follows a bunch of characters who live in the seaside town of Tasker Bay. Andi works at the arcade in town saving up money to get the fuck out of there when Mal, her boss, brings in a second-hand arcade machine he just bought for cheap. Polybius. The arcade game becomes an instant hit with people lining up to play it and even fighting to get a chance to try it out. And, right after they play the game, people change - they have visions, dreams, crazy ideas, they lose time… In the meantime, David, the sheriff's deputy, is investigating weird cases of violence that have just started happening in town.As I said, this was FUN. I love it when a horror book features video games, it’s just so cool to me. I had so much fun reading this, I was 100% hooked. At some point, I think I said out loud ‘this is so fucking good’ while reading it (I’m also very cheap and easy to get into urban mysteries, I love a good rabbit hole and this book had plenty). Two other aspects I want to mention are that 1) this is the perfect balance between a plot-driven and character-driven book, just fantastic storytelling. 2) I loved the writing and the vibe of it all, though it felt a little dense overall.I loved the atmosphere. This felt like the 1980-1990s movies where kids found something and came together to solve the mystery. Getting to actually get some answers from the ‘guy behind (some of) it all’ was as close as solving the urban mystery as we’ll ever get. What a cool idea and what an amazing take. I guess it is a bit cheesy, but it’s also what I wanted from it. (PS - the blurb says this is like The Walking Dead and idk where they see any connection).It’s a 4.5 read. Rounded down because it felt a bit too heavy and slow at times. If you liked this book, I strongly suggest you pick up The Between by Ryan Leslie. It’s not about an arcade game but a text-based RPG and it hits as good as this one did.Content Warning: this includes violence. The first sign that things are going really wrong is a pretty gruesome scene involving animals (horses).*ARC received for free. This has not impacted my review.","2.5 rounded up.I heard about this internet urban legend before, so I was intrigued by the idea of a full-length book based on the idea. This was an early review copy, and read like it needed a bit more editing. There was some bad grammar and incorrect sentence structure here and there, as well as an over abundance of commas.I hate giving this note, but there was quite a bit of telling rather than showing for some of the initial chapters. (Summarizing the situations for the characters, how they feel about each other, an explanation of their personal history, etc. No actual examples of these things in action.)What I did appreciate were the short sections. I like being able to read a book in brief bursts because of my uncooperative attention span. However, the constant back and forth between multiple characters’ POV and the frequent introduction of various new names and faces had me constantly fatigued. There were so many townspeople that when some of them showed back up later I didn’t remember what they had done in previous chapters or how I was supposed to remember them.I didn’t feel the chemistry between Andi and Ro. It seemed forced. Some of their dialogue sounded artificial, also. A major issue for me was that I didn’t really care about any of these characters. Ro’s ex was pretty likable, but she sort of took a backseat for much of the plot.There are multiple reviews that mention pacing issues and I couldn’t agree more. The middle of this has sections that feel both slow and repetitive, with too much switching between POVs, and then at the end there’s a whole lot of stuff happening all at once and the action is confusing in places.I wanted more of the creepy video game narrative. Much of this read like a Needful Things sort of story, with a town tearing itself apart with violence. And the blurb that compares it to Stranger Things? Not very accurate.The ending was fine, but it didn’t work for me. I can’t say for sure how I would have done it differently.Cool cover, though!Thank you to Netgalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.Biggest TW: Animal harm/Death","If you are a fan of Stephen King's 1980s novels then you will also be a fan of Collin Anderson. Anderson's debut novel has all of the marks of a great suspense, horror, thriller. The pace of the horror grows gradually until, before you know it, you are in the depths of chaos. I was lucky to receive an ARC of Polybius for free, and I am voluntarily leaving my opinions of this novel. Thank you to the author, publisher and Goodreads for this opportunity. As a character driven tale, Anderson has written a novel that is full of strong characters. Andi and her mother are not withering helpless women in their approaches to facing and solving problems. Ro and his dad also step up to protect others during dangerous times in Tasker Bay. The risks the four characters take to figure out what is causing the rash of violence in their small community become more and more lethal as the reach of Polybius spreads. Anderson also writes about how relationships can either break or become stronger in the face of danger. This is Anderson's first step to becoming an author who will be one fans of slow burn horror will love. I look forward to his next novel."
Cold Eternity,S.A. Barnes,3.75,"Atmospheric, creepy, eerie, chilling, and horrific! S.A. Barnes is queen of space-fantasy-spaceship books! I can always count on her to bring the thrills, the chills, and to provide the hairs standing up on the back of my neck feeling that I love. This book is oozing with unease and dread. Cold Eternity gave me the heebie jeebies. Can you imagine being on a spaceship, cut off from others, having to hit a button every three hours, and hearing strange small noises? S.A. Barnes brilliantly nailed the eeriness and loneliness of space, coupled with sleep deprivation, tension, and dread.Halley has accepted a job on the Elysian Fields, a spaceship carrying the cryogenically frozen bodies of Earth's wealthiest and elite citizens. There she will do rounds and push a button every 3 hours in exchange for room and board and a small salary. She is happy to have the job as she is running from a political scandal.Things take a turn when she thinks she saw something. But she is sleep deprived, and who hasn't seen something out of the corner of their eye to only have it be something else. Karl, the mechanic and man who hired her, says it was nothing, just a computer glitch...This book played out like a movie in my mind. I loved the atmosphere, the trapped feeling, the unease, and the dread. I also loved the creepiness of Halley being on board a ship full of cryogenically frozen bodies. Creepy! The eerie vibe mixed with the mounting dread and tension had me feeling tense and on the edge of my seat. I had no idea where this book was heading or what was going to happen as Halley walked around making her rounds. This book is a little bit of a slow burn but I did not mind it one bit as I knew that Barnes was building tension and dread while enabling readers to get to know more about Halley and the Elysian Fields ship. This book becomes more and more terrifying as the book progresses.  If you have not read a book by S.A. Barnes before this is a great book to start with. My favorite book of hers is Dead Silence.Chilling well thought out, horrific, and atmospheric!Thank you to Tor Nightfire and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖","3.0 StarsAfter reading this author's last two space horror novels, I have become wary of their work. The ending of Dead Silence was frustrating and Ghost Station was overall quite dry. Normally when I strike out with an author, I would give up on an author. However, as someone who is obsessed with the genre sci fi horror, I keep holding our hope for a new favourite. Perhaps this is a symptom of my power expectations but I was fairly happy with the first half of this novel. I enjoyed a lot of the science fiction elements and found the story itself to be reasonably engrossing. Towards the second half, my warmed feelings cooled. I find this author struggles to write a compelling climax and ending which feels particularly important in this subgenre. This one had a decent setup but failed to come together in a satisfying way.Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher","Cold Eternity is the latest release from S.A. Barnes, author of Dead Silence and Ghost Station. I always look forward to Barnes new books and this one did not disappoint.This is another Space Horror novel and features a compelling protagonist, Halley, who after taking a remote assignment on an abandoned space barge, discovers there's more danger in the job than she could've ever anticipated.In the very beginning, this was giving me light-Artemis vibes. I think mostly because Halley, the way we meet her and the things she was thinking about at that time, were reminiscent of Jazz, the MC in Artemis.You can tell that Halley is girl with a complicated past, who is trying her best to stay clear of it. I liked how the author filled that in for us over time, and I truly became attached to Halley and her well-being over the course of the story.She takes the job on Elysian Fields, a giant space barge housing a now defunct cryo program, thinking the remoteness and isolation will help her to avoid the things she's trying to avoid. Unfortunately, life on the floating crypt isn't as harmless as she thought it would be.Constant disturbing noises, and mysterious moving figures, haunt Halley's days and nights. She finds it impossible to sleep, impossible to rest her nerve-rattled brain.Karl, the only other human worker aboard, is just as puzzling as everything else about the Elysian Fields. Halley's thoughts race and ramble as she tries to make sense of her new surroundings. It's during this time that the Reader may begin to question how well they can rely on their narrator.Learning about the Elysium Fields, its past, Halley's connection to it and its present iteration was so compelling. Barnes does the horrors of future tech so well, and this story is absolutely terrifying if you think about it for too long...S.A. Barnes has really made a name for herself in the SF-Horror space. She does such an incredible job creating an ominous atmosphere in each one of her stories, as well as well-developed main characters.I feel like some Readers may avoid, or be intimidated by SciFi stories, as they feel like they may be too science-heavy, or too high-concept, for them to understand, or be pulled in by. And while I can understand that inclination with many SF-books, I would urge you, if this is you, to give S.A. Barnes's work a try.She makes her stories accessible to all types of Readers, whether you are a big-SF fan or not, I think you'll easily be pulled in by her work and find it enjoyable.This story, in particular, is well within our range of current understanding as tech rapidly progresses around us every day. I could absolutely picture a world where a situation like this becomes a reality.Stories of futuristic tech always get under my skin. I just find it genuinely frightening to think about. All the ways such developments could go wildly wrong. Reading about it, in fun works of fiction like this, provide me with a safe place to explore such concepts, and honestly, it does help lessen some anxiety around these topics for me.That may sound silly, but it is one of the reasons I so enjoy this type of story, and S.A. Barnes is my absolute go-to author for gripping, realistic, futuristic SF-Horror.This had a lot of unsettling moments, with a great creepy atmosphere throughout. Towards the end it did have some moments where it started to feel a little muddled for me, but overall, it was a great reading experience.Thank you so much to the publisher, Tor Nightfire and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with copies to read and review. I'll be anticipating whatever Barnes releases next!!!"
Pride or Die,CL Montblanc,3.69,"C. L. Montblanc’s debut novel is a young adult mystery featuring several members of the senior class at Hillview High School in fictional Cabotsville, Texas. Eleanora just wants to finish her senior year and get out of Texas. However, when her club meeting coincides with an attack on the school’s head cheerleader, she and her friends find themselves the prime suspects in an attempted murder. Unable to rely upon the principal, teachers, or the police, Eleanora, Tyler, Noah, and Salim decide to clear their names and ensure the survival of their club for future teens. They’re not detectives, but they decide their only choice is to become sleuths and solve the mystery. The club is for those who identify differently or are unsure of their orientation or those who need a safe haven among friends.The four main characters are reasonably well developed. The story is from Eleanora’s point of view and she has the most depth. She is headstrong, tends to go full speed ahead, and cares about having a safe haven for future students. She also tends to make everything her burden to carry. Readers get a good feel for several of the supporting characters, including Kenley, the cheerleader and her boyfriend.The novel starts with the attempted murder in the first chapter and a lot of the story is about solving the mystery and finding who actually is responsible for the attack. However, the book is about much more than that. It has threads woven throughout the novel about bullying, secrets, gossip, lies, teenagers trying to get into colleges, reputations being ruined, and irresponsible adults trying to blame the action on a group for expediency rather than fully investigating the crime. The premise of the novel is great. However, I felt that several of the adults were somewhat exaggerated, especially the police reliance on Principal Ballard’s word versus evidence. Additionally, the minors were questioned without a parent or guardian. While there is some humor sprinkled throughout the book, the topics it explores are serious and these are what kept me invested in the story. The actual culprit was a little too easily discerned, but there are a couple of other surprises in the somewhat over-the-top ending.Overall, this is an engaging debut young adult mystery novel full of teen angst that also has some plot twists along with social commentary. It has a great message without excessive and unnecessary oversimplification.St. Martin’s Press – Wednesday Books and Lindy Ryan provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

What Remains of Teague House,Stacy Johns,3.52,"A captivating mashup of a murder mystery and family drama, What Remains of Teague House quickly had me under its thrall. With a dysfunctional family and plenty of long-buried secrets, the echoes of the past reverberated throughout this original story. After all, it started off with quite the bang and smoothly unfurled layers of foreboding thanks to the dual timelines and multiple POVs. And let me tell you, that setting? It was simply divine. Between the ominous woods and a house sprinkled with hidey-holes throughout its walls, it came brilliantly to life before my eyes.Just as the setting was a hole in one, so too were the characters. Thanks to a number of flaws, each of the family members felt true-to-life as they dealt with their grief in their own individual ways. In the same breath, they all had my hackles raised as I looked at them with utter suspicion. Well-developed and fully-fleshed out, they felt as real as could be just like the setting. Alongside an atmosphere rife with eerie, dark tension, this family’s past was peeled like an onion as betrayals and deceit oozed out of the walls. All told, it delivered in spades—for the most part, that is.You see, there were sadly a few weak spots for me. My biggest hang up was how I guessed the big, giant twist almost right from the start. Sure to be a jaw-dropper for most readers, for this thriller lover I jumped the gun early. I also found myself having a tough time keeping track of whose history was whose as the number and depth of backgrounds grew with each page. That being said, the last handful of chapters left me with a Cheshire Cat-esque grin taking over my face. Clever, well-plotted, and oh so suspenseful, I was pulled into this slow burn murder mystery despite its few flaws.All said and done, this debut novel managed to transport me onto the grounds of Teague House in no time at all. With complex group dynamics and a fine web of secrets, I was head over heels as I felt like a fly on the wall. Do I wish that the finale had been explored in more detail? Well, yes. Despite this, however, the brilliant epilogue won me over 100%. Delivering a right hook just when I thought it was all over, Ms. Johns showed off her masterful skill. So if you’re looking for a riveting whodunnit full of dead bodies, enigmatic mysteries, and well-hidden lies, you’ve found it right here. Rating of 4 stars.SYNOPSIS:When the Rawlins family matriarch unexpectedly passes, all three adult children rush home.

The Rawlins siblings (Jon, Sandy, and Rob) have regrouped at their childhood home, Teague House, after the passing of their mother. Each sibling has troubles and wants to bury their mother and move on with their lives. When Sandy and Jon stumble across a recently dug mound of earth with part of a body sticking out whilst out for a walk on their family's vast plot of land, which then uncovers a burial site of multiple bodies, this makes their time back at the house even more conflicted. As each sibling tries to connect the dots and uncover what and who has murdered and buried these bodies on their land and if their parents were a part of something sinister, the house is broken into making them realise someone is looking for something they don't want to be found. Along side this we follow Maddie who's a private investigator searching for her missing friends remains and when similarities are found with one of the bodies that coinside with her friends disappearance, body type etc, she's hot on the heels to discover if this is the breakthrough she's been chasing for years so she can finally put her friend to rest. This was an interesting and twisty read that took some time to get into, but I felt the ending was very rushed together and was missing something for me.","find more reviews on my blog 3.5 ⭐️Teague House is a creepy family estate that’s giving major ""skeletons in the closet"" vibes… except, you know, they’re actual skeletons in the backyard. Let’s dive in, shall we?The Rawlins siblings—Jon, Sandra, and Robby—reunite at their gloomy Oregon childhood home, Teague House, after their aloof mother, Val, kicks the bucket. I was so here for the gothic vibes: creaky floors, foggy woods, and a family so dysfunctional they make my holiday dinners look like a Hallmark movie. Then, bam! They find a fresh grave in the backyard, followed by a whole cemetery of older ones. Cue Whoopi Goldberg, “You in danger, girl!” Johns paints Teague House like it’s auditioning for a horror flick. The woods feel alive, whispering secrets, and every room in that house is stuffed with grief and old grudges. I could practically smell the musty curtains and hear the wind rattling the windows. The multiple POVs—siblings, their aunt Phil, and a PI named Maddie Reed—kept me on my toes, like I was piecing together a juicy puzzle. Maddie, oh my gosh, she’s my kind of girl: tough, haunted, and chasing a killer who might tie to her own past. I was rooting for her. But, okay, let’s get real for a sec. The pacing? It’s like Johns invited me to a fabulous party but forgot to serve snacks for the first hour. The start drags, with too much family bickering before the bodies pop up. I was ready to yell, “Get to the good stuff!” And when the reveals finally hit, they’re juicy, but some felt like they were pulled out of a hat. I wanted more breadcrumbs, more “aha!” moments that made me feel clever, not just shocked. The ending, bless its heart, tries to tie every loose end into a bow, but it’s more like a hasty knot. Still, I enjoyed reading about Sandra’s repressed memories or Robby’s shady vibe that had me side-eyeing him from page one. Johns nails the messy, human side of family trauma—like, I texted my sister after reading to make sure we don’t have any buried secrets (jury’s still out, even though we already found out about the killer uncle—true story). The characters are flawed and gray, and I was living for it. Aunt Phil’s flashbacks? Chef’s kiss for adding spice to the past.So, What Remains of Teague House is a moody, twisty debut that’s perfect for anyone who loves a thriller with a side of family drama. I’m already daydreaming about Johns’ next book, because if this is her first swing, I’m obsessed with what’s coming."
The Thorns,Dawn Kurtagich,3.50,"HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY!“She makes things out of other things—she turns them into something better. I wonder if that’s what she did with me. Took what I was and made me better.”I’ve said this before, but if you are a fan of psychological horror, Dawn Kurtagich is the author you NEED to read. I’m not sure why she floats under the radar, as all of her books are creepy, disturbing, and oh so DARK!The Thorns begins with a note from the author that the plot for this book is written from many of her own experiences at boarding school. It includes trigger warnings for the reader, so I will include them for you before my review:Trigger Warnings: Darker themes, specifically bullying, sexual violence, gaslighting, self-harm, chronic pain, minor alcohol and drug abuse, reference to animal harm, and mental health crises.Bethany is an award winning author of the Sally Chronicles. She is struggling to write the last book in the series to make her deadline when her husband is unexpectedly called away for business in South Africa. Despite the fact that she relies on his constant help to remember to take her pills and to get around on crutches and a wheelchair, she tells him she will be fine while he is away. However, as soon as he is gone, she stops taking her pills and begins to remember her experiences at boarding school seventeen years ago. Told in alternating perspectives between past and present, Bethany is forced to confront the truth about her obsessive and abusive friendship with Stacey, the inspiration for her FMC in the Sally Chronicles.Visceral and deeply personal, The Thorns is a heartbreaking story that sheds some light on the author’s inspiration to write horror novels. I truly hope that the most brutal parts of this plot are fiction. Kurtagich grabs ahold of the reader and doesn’t let go until the shocking twist is revealed at the very end. This would have been a five star read, but I was left wanting a bit more from the ending. Perhaps this was done on purpose, as I just learned The Thorns is part of a two book deal and a sequel is forthcoming!Highly recommend!4.5/5 stars rounded down Expected publication date: 4/1/25Thank you to NetGalley and Thomas & Mercer publishing for the ARC of The Thorns in exchange for an honest review.","I picked this up because the synopsis sounded really interesting; it gave off strong urban legend vibes (an entity called ""Glass Man,"" invoked through a mostly made-up game, starts haunting two schoolgirls), it involved supernatural shenanigans of the kind made popular by well-known authors such as Stephen King (the two girls meet again in adulthood, one is an author, and they have to face the entity again), and it promised some nice moments of friendship, several instances of coming-of-age situations, and warned of some ""adolescent abuse"".The book does not deliver any of those things. Nothing of what I said is vital to the plot. ""The Thorns"" is simply not the book the synopsis describes. First of all, there's no ""Glass Man,"" not in any meaningful way - forget games and hauntings; the (very rarely mentioned - four or five times?) words ""Glass Man"" name simply a vague threat which plays absolutely no role in the novel. Second, there's nothing supernatural in the book: there's just plain old girl angst, girl cliques, and lots of bullying. Third, what happens in adulthood has nothing to do with any ""Glass Man"" or whatever happened in the school: the 'friendship' is purely toxic and destructive, it involves mental issues (NB: not psychological horror!), and the fact that one of the women is an author, is nothing but mere lip service to standard literary tropes - to spice things up a bit in an otherwise dull story of female infighting. Finally, and far more serious than anything else, the book's ""adolescent abuse"" is the extended descriptions of intimate sexual relations of a 28-year-old man with a thirteen year old girl. The descriptions are not graphic or violent - but they are disturbing, mostly because the author takes great care to portray the girl as giving consent. Those moments were chilling and really horrific: the girl is no Lolita, she's a traumatized, intelligent and caring little girl (her body hasn't even matured fully) who allows herself to be manipulated into (yes, I see the contradiction as well) a very sick sexually abusive relationship. She's also confused enough to start a sexual relationship with a boy at the same time, but I won't go into that. Perhaps this kind of experiences explain why the same girl, as a woman, never sounds any different in adulthood: she's always acting and speaking as if she's mentally stuck in early adolescence, sounding like a 13yo girl throughout the book. So what's the book about? It's about mental instability and toxicity among women. The ending has a very predictable 'twist' about the relationship between the two girls, a turn of events not worth the investment (this is a big book, after all!). Noone who's read a healthy number of psychological thrillers is going to be shocked by the ending. So be warned: unless you enjoy sentimentalist displays of adolescent confusion, on multiple levels, don't pick up this book.","**3.5-stars**The Thorns follows our MC, Bethany, through both Past and Present perspectives. Present Bethany is a successful author, wife, and a bit of a recluse.Bethany is the author of a popular series, who is now struggling to write the final book, in which her beloved protagonist, Sally, is slated to be killed. She just can't seem to get it right, causing her a lot of inner turmoil.Past Bethany has been shipped off to a remote boarding school by her mother. Feeling abandoned and alone, Bethany befriends a fellow classmate, Stacey, who she comes to idolize, shall we say, to an unhealthy degree.In the Present, Bethany is thrown for a loop when she receives an email from Stacey out of the blue. You can tell they haven't been a part of each other's lives for quite some time, but why? What happened?The Past clues us in to their complicated friendship, taking us through the various uncomfortable circumstances they got themselves into while at school together. Eventually, Past and Present merge revealing the truth behind Bethany and Stacey's relationship.This is a tough on for me, because I Love Dawn Kurtagich's writing and daring imagination. The Thorns has a solid ominous feel to it, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but it also had its issues that sadly brought down my rating.For me, it's one of those stories where a lot is happening, but simultaneously, it feels like nothing is happening. I was constantly waiting for something big to be revealed, and then when it was, I had predicted it from very early on and it didn't end up being as satisfying as I would've hoped.It also felt too drawn out and I didn't enjoy the 2nd-person narration style of the Present perspective. Nevertheless, Kurtagich gets full marks for her creativity and follow-through on ideas, and this is still a good book, which just happened to fall a little flat for me. I was hoping for a deeper connection and to be more compelled by the narrative than I was. The middle portions felt quite General Fiction as opposed to the dark-intrigue that I was expecting.With all this being said, I know so many Readers are going to love this. The back-and-forth does build up some anticipation, and I feel like the topics explored are strong and well-executed.Thank you to the publisher, Thomas & Mercer, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I'm looking forward to more from Kurtagich!"
Sour Cherry,Natalia Theodoridou,3.74,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Horror + Literary Fiction + RetellingSour Cherry falls into several different genres. It is a gothic horror and also a literary fiction. The book is also considered a combination of folklore retelling and magical realism. It is a retelling of Bluebeard, but I haven’t read the original tale, so I cannot compare the two.The story follows Agnes, who, after losing her child at birth, is summoned to nurse one of the local lords’ infant sons in their manor. There are many creepy things about this child as he grows up. He seems to carry a plague with him wherever he goes. He brings bad luck, grim fate, and death. The worst thing is that even the women he gets involved with face a grim fate.This book is so captivating with such an interesting premise. In the beginning, I was under the impression that this would be comparable to ""The Omen,"" but the similarities were only slight. The story is heavier on gender issues and toxic masculinity, making it a truly thought-provoking book. For a debut book, this beautifully written novel is a great start for the author. They mastered creating the right atmosphere and setting for the story. At times, readers might feel the story is a bit slow, but the emotional depth it offers completely compensates for any shortcomings. I liked it a lot.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with the ARC of this book.","Started off as an intriguing retelling of bluebeard, but became tedious to read halfway through. With all the palpable tension and foreshadowing throughout the book, I was expecting a more climactic conclusion. Also found the writing to be a bit disjointed, especially with the constant shifting between past and present. While I appreciate the sentiment and message of the book, it’s a bit too muddled to leave a lasting impression on me","thanks to edelweiss for the drc! this book gets a whole 5 stars from me, a hater...oh my god, this was just perfect. rarely if ever have i liked a 'fairytale retelling' (feels reductive to call it that, it's just too good) even though i always WANT to like them - this delivered absolutely everything and more. the last 10% actually floored me, apologies to anyone who experienced my Live Slug Reaction real-time as i clutched my head in my hands and said ""oh no, oh no"" a bunch. seriously, WOW. no, you don't need to be familiar with Bluebeard to read this, but yes, it's even better with context, since this work plays with the fourth wall and is definitely in conversation the original and stageplay versions of this tale (and probably to some other stuff I'm missing! I had no real knowledge before reading this, but I'm certainly interested now). thank you to edelweiss for the arc, i can't wait to reread the physical when it comes out... as a sidenote, this book made some really fucking cool graphic design choices for page layouts + margins, which isn't something i see that often! truly just great on every level."
The Coven Tendency,Zoe Hana Mikuta,3.73,this book is sooooooooo weird (affectionate),"Mikuta has a singular voice in deft and engrossing madness with a viscerally wanting vein. Endlessly unique and assured, at once grotesque fantasy and sharply aware dystopia—THE COVEN TENDENCY unravels the alienating cage of modern spectacle and artificiality, and the apocalypse of distorted intimacy. I couldn't get this world out of my head. You've never read anything like this.(if you liked Nope and want something even wilder, try this. for fans of weird fantasy, smart dystopia, spec fic with very contemporary commentary, and also fans of fucked up but deeply intimate romances(?) involving a little killing, necromancy, and cannibalism <3)","4/25/25 - omg where do i even start with this one... dare i say the most experimental work by zoe hana mikuta yet, THE COVEN TENDENCY is a nail biting, terrifyingly intimate, beating wound of a novel that takes a scalpel to the lovesick teenager and doesn’t stop until there’s a corpse, or a memory, or a corpse again, or a girl.a tale of resurrection and necromantic witches, the story follows Vanity Adams and her twin Arrogance: both living as witches in a world that treats them as spectacles to be gawked at while harvesting their magic to convert into the drug “World.” as confusing and addictive as any drug, the book is difficult to follow at first, but reminds me of HARROW THE NINTH both in its alluring prose and the IMMENSE payout you’ll get after reading pages of what at first seems like complete nonsense. i promise it’s so worth it. mikuta’s characters, like always, leap off the page with their piercing dialogue and internal singularity. this is definitely one i won’t forget… i’m still haunted by that LISA: The Joyful-esque ending tbh… (iykyk) 5 beautiful stars!!!///UPDATE 4/3/25 MY PRE-ORDER CAME IN!!! RTC RTC!!///on my knees for anything zoe hana mikuta writes"
Deadstream,Mar Romasco-Moore,3.59,"ARC for review. To be published April 1, 2025. 2 stars, YA for YA. Billed as “Rear Window” meets “The Ring.” Uh huh. Teresa is agoraphobic after a car accident that killed her best friend and her world is shrinking. First she could only be on her family’s property, then only in the house. Now she’s limited to her room. So she never leaves her own bedroom and nothing ever happens to her so there’s no story here and we can all go do something else, like go watch that “Seinfeld” where they go to India for a wedding and it’s told in reverse. That’s a good one. Or so it would have been back in my day (imagine this said in the cracked voice of the old crone that I suppose I now am) when we had to internet. And no web cams. And you didn’t have relationships with people you didn’t actually know. But the world spins on, and Teresa has all kinds of contact with the outside world through the people she has met online. O e night that world goes horribly wrong when she sees and records a shadow on her favorite personality’s online stream (it’s worth noting that Teresa isn’t talking to friends from school or anything. She watches “personalities” who monetize their content and she’s hoping against hope to be able to do the same one day, but she’s not having tons of luck with that. So, yes, she wants to be an “influencer,” one of the truly abhorrent things about the internet.). But I digress. This personality’s personality (ha!) starts to change. And then he dies. Online. In front of thousands. What has Teresa recorded and what is happening? So, this isn’t a copy of “The Ring” or “Rear Window,” and it’s pretty disturbing to think about teenage kids doing any of this. At the same time I can see this totally creeping out 12 year olds who I am assuming would be the target audience. Oh, and all the stuff about West Virginia’s quiet zone is totally true. I don’t even think residents can have garage door openers there. The observatory is really cool and worth visiting if you are ever nearby.","👾 4.5 stars 👾Thank you to Netgalley and Viking Books for sending me this ARC in exchange for an honest review!Expected release date: April 1st 2025Do you see us, too?

Plot-wise, it's like The Ring, but with a modern twist and, in my opinion, a more interesting antagonist. I loved the media mixed throughout this book (the screenshots of live chats, discussion threads, DMs, etc.) and the accuracy of the social media used. Most authors writing modern day teenage characters tend to over-exaggerate the slang, social media activities, and how people act online, but Mar Romasco-Moore hits the nail on the head. Even the Reddit activity (tendency to upvote/downvote) was perfectly accurate. The only character we really get to know is Teresa and she's okay. She's not a character I can particularly relate to as a cishet, non-traumatized girl (lol), so I can't speak as to whether she was accurately written. What I can say is unlike some other portrayals of anxiety/panic attacks/PTSD, hers don't feel forced. It's a center part of her character but it's very organically written and actually adds to the story.I wonder if part of this book isn't an allegory of the internet. The way some online exchanges are written, the characters' motivations, and the climax seem to have those undertones. It feels like this book shows the positive side of the internet - forming a community, finding your identity, etc. - and meshes it with the negative side by adding supernatural elements to represent the negative. If it's intentional and I'm not just reading too much into it, it adds so much more substance to the book. A super entertaining read! I'm definitely checking out some of Mar Romasco-Moore's other books :)","The internet is a scary place especially when live streaming turns deadly. This book is a great combination of The Ring, Rear Window and a dash of Nancy Drew. This book introduces us to Teresa aka Replay, she is a young woman dealing the consequences of a horrific accident that has left her traumatized and trapped mentally. It’s hard to make connections with people in person so she easily finds they’re easily made online also via streaming. One day while watching one of her favorite streamer person she stumbles upon a mystery that turns her world completely upside down. Against all odds she must face her fears and saves the internet world.This YA book was a great and quick read I finished it in 2 days. I couldn’t put this book down that is a indication to how good the book is. I did like how the author added the story line with the LGBTQ+ community.

She's a Lamb!,Meredith Hambrock,3.91,"I used to work for a small theatre company started by a group of friends that I was tangentially connected to in those early and fearless years after everyone had finished their various college degrees. They were idealistic and had visions of making bold theatre that stood out amongst the typical fare of the city that we had all adopted and all had begun to refer to as home. They formed as a collective of about a dozen large, all from various backgrounds and all having some general idea of what they specialized in and could bring to the group. By the time I made my move to the city and joined the party, things had dwindled down to a few remaining stalwarts that kept the tent poles propped up and continued to produce shows on a regular basis. Initially, I joined on as a bit of a last minute favour to help design and manage the sound for an upcoming performance. I expected to do my time, have a bit of fun and then go back to my own thing. What I didn’t expect was how deeply I would lap up the Kool-Aid like I’d been lost in the desert for years.There are few feelings as powerful as that of delusion. And while it is often presented as a negative thing, it is through the power of delusion that we are often able to accomplish things that feel out of reach or even otherworldly. You would be hard pressed to find a celebrity or politician alive that hadn’t ever subscribed to some sort of overhyped belief in themselves that made them truly feel that they were the answer to people’s need for direction, for guidance, for entertainment or for their well-being.Jessamyn St. Germain is the beating heart of Meredith Hambrock’s She’s A Lamb. And while she appears to be the epitome of the most unreliable narrator, she exists more so in a near-consistent state of blurred vision with small pockets of extreme focus in which the genuine article that is her appears right before it is handily shoved back into the muck and the haze of her delusions of grandeur. Jessamyn is an actor, but not an actor that is satisfied with playing young moms in laundry commercials or taking the lead role in a serious and dialogue-heavy theatre production. Instead, Jessamyn believes that she is destined to star in the only aspect of performance that she bears any credence to: musical theatre.From the get go, we are presented with a version of Jessamyn that despite being intelligent, witty and admirably dedicated to her craft, is wholly unlikable as a person. She’s narcissistic, snobby and the cloud of rage that simmers just underneath the surface is apparent almost immediately. And while in most cases, it would be hard to find any modicum of sympathy for a character that made the decision to turn her stalker into her boyfriend (simply because it made her feel like she had her first fan) while she also dates another man purely for the fact that he spoils her with money, food and Uber rides, somehow Meredith Hambrock pulls off the near impossible and has crafted a character in Jessamyn St. Germain that is supremely easy to be frustrated with while also catching yourself rooting for her at the same time.As the story unfolds, Jessamyn becomes singularly focused on securing the lead role of Maria Von Trapp in a small local theatre’s production of The Sound Of Music through whatever means necessary. That the theatre hosting the performance also happens to be where she works part-time as an usher for the mostly geriatric crowds that fill the theatre on weekends doesn’t deter her strident belief that she isn’t just the right choice for the role, she was born to play and perform this part. However, it quickly becomes clear that Jessamyn’s belief in herself remains solely with herself as those around her generally appear baffled when she sings and gently encourage her to keep taking legitimate acting roles where they are convinced she will shine and where Jessamyn is certain she will drown in boredom and sadness.What follows is a spiral into levels of frustration and desperation that Jessamyn is unprepared for, but does little to ward off her delusion that she was meant to play this particular role in this particular performance. Along the way, we get small glimpses into her relationships with both of her boyfriends, as well as the burgeoning friendship/relationship with Rudy, a co-worker at the theatre that actually seems to take the time to look for the real Jessamyn behind the facade that she presents. As we learn more about Jessamyn’s past with her father, about her past involvement in a Shakespearean festival, about her competitiveness with her peer and nemesis, Samantha, about all the myriad of ways that she’s been strung along, lied to, used for money, the underlying rage that exists as a growing fever inside of her and the seemingly disconnected and uncaring way that she traverses through the world and with the people that she interacts with as she moves toward her goals start to line up and make sense. In the end, the greatest role that Jessamyn continually plays is that of someone that has their shit together and isn’t always five seconds away from losing it.As I’ve started to spend more time writing about the books that I am reading, I find myself taking notes as I go along; marking down thoughts or revelations that I have as I absorb the text or just copying down a quote that I want to make sure I don’t forget. The biggest compliment that I can give to She’s A Lamb is that just under halfway through my time with it, I completely stopped taking notes because I was just enjoying the act of reading this book and the time that I got to spend with it so much. Walking up the stairs in my house and trying not to trip as I read, standing over the sink to eat toast and drink coffee while I block out the world and read, sitting in the car eking out every last second possible that I can take in just a bit more of Jessamyn’s wild story.My own time working with a theatre company was relatively short, but the delusion hit all of us as the rehearsals went on and we felt like we had come up with something that was going to shake the world. Even through performances where less than ten people arrived to witness the show, we still held onto that belief that we were doing something important, something vital. And while it’s easy to look at She’s A Lamb and marvel at the depths to which someone like Jessamyn can sink into delusion, it’s also just as easy to forget that without that burning feeling that we are absolutely destined for something great, whether it be a fleeting thought or a persistent hum that drowns out all other rational thought, none of us would ever achieve even a fraction of the things that we dream about.I’d like to thank Meredith Hambrock for sending me an advanced copy of her truly wonderful book to read and review.","Jessamyn will stop at nothing to become a Broadway star. But she’s a long way off from that goal. Currently, she juggles working as an usher at a theatre in Vancouver with auditioning for TV commercials. So when she gets the opportunity to try out for the main role in a local performance of The Sound of Music, she’s convinced that this will be her big break. The only problem is she doesn’t book the part. Or any part, actually. She is offered a job—as a babysitter for the child actors. Jessamyn knows in her heart that she could do a better job than the woman cast as the lead…and she’ll go to great lengths to try and snatch the role out from under her.I expected this book to be darkly hilarious (which it absolutely was) but I didn’t expect it to be so emotionally stirring. Even though Jessamyn is a deluded and amoral character, I couldn’t help feeling sorry for her and wanting her to succeed. I think what this book depicts especially well is how some men project the personalities they want to see onto women who are beautiful. Jessamyn is gorgeous, and one suitor is convinced that she has hidden intellectual depths while another is sure she is craving a life of domesticity. Jessamyn’s actual personality traits and opinions don’t really factor into their perceptions of her. As much as she wields her beauty for her own gain, it is also one of her greatest liabilities.I love when a book gives me a villain I want to root for. Jessamyn isn’t particularly likeable or relatable, but by the end of the book I was cheering her on…despite some VERY questionable choices.","firstly, thank you to the publisher for an arc and an alc!PLEASE check trigger warnings because this is an extremely dark book that talks about very serious topics (sexual assault, stalking, abuse) in a light manner due to the POV of our mc, who is quite literally delusional and obsessive. instant five stars — this was a WILD ride, and the narrator totally added to the chaotic energy with her spectacular performance.our fmc jessamyn is quite literally a psycho — she is a danger not only to herself but to others, especially those she is jealous of. she has no empathy for others; she uses (emotionally, mentally, financially), and physically harms others in an attempt to clear obstructions and achieve her own delusional goals: to become an award winning actress. despite jessamyn herself being a victim, she is not sympathetic to other victims, or even herself.the narrator captured the chaotic delusion of a narcissist PERFECTLY.i’m excited to read whatever else the author writes!"

After everything they've been through lately, she just wants to see him happy again.To be honest, Quinn was ready to leave Philadelphia anyway. Since her Mom's tragic, and very public death, it was difficult to be there; to deal with everyone's pitying looks.When they arrive at their new home, they discover a dilapidated farmhouse located in the middle of a cornfield. Quinn can't say she's surprised. Hello, Missouri.Cue the eerie atmosphere. Does anyone else find cornfields hella creepy? No, just me?Unpacking in her new room, Quinn gazes out over the expanse of fields surrounding them. She notices an abandoned factory in the distance.There's a mural painted on the side of a giant clown face. Worst of all, the pervy skeeve seems to be staring directly into her window.She can't believe this is her life now. It's surreal; creepy clown face and all. The town seems like something straight out of a movie.Attending school the following day, Quinn begins to get acquainted with the local kids. An over-the-top teacher having a temper tantrum, even kicks her out of his classroom on her first day. It's a lot to process.Because of this event, she ends up hanging out with some of the most popular kids in the school who also have to serve detention. They seem a little wild, but not all bad.They end up inviting Quinn to a Founder's Day party. What could go wrong?Y'all, I had so much fun reading this. Clown in a Cornfield was EVERYTHING I was hoping it would be!Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. It is the perfect book to read during the spooky season with all the Fall vibes. I live for that!Is this a perfect book? No, probably not, but was it the perfect book for me? Abso-freakin-lutely!!Those of you who know me, you know that clowns are my biggest fear. I actually have never read a book with a clown in it.Not even It.It's true. I knew after seeing this around and reading the synopsis, that I wanted to give it a try.I am so happy I went way outside my comfort zone and picked this one up. It truly had everything I love in a Teen Scream, which incidentally is one of my favorite subgenres of Horror.Clown in a Cornfield features: new girl trope, final girl trope, kids behaving badly, corrupt town officials, an ominous atmosphere, a huge teen party, biting social commentary, a cleverly positioned ending, and plenty of jumps along the way!This is just pure fun on the page. It's a must read for the Fall!!! Don't miss out. Frendo will be mad if you do.","UPDATE: $2.99 Kindle US Today 10/25/20What in the hell ass crazy clown did I just read!! 🤨🤡This WAS NOT what I was expecting, not by a damn long shot!

SMALL TOWN + SERIAL KILLER CLOWN + TEENAGE PARTIES??? (what could go wrong?) = 
EVERYTHING
. But in the best way possible. This book had the highest body count I've ever read in a slasher novel. Bodies dropping left and right—
slash, stick, stabby stabby, shot, burned, sliced, and diced
. SCREAM could never! Entertainment value??? 
10000000000000% BISH!!!!
This book was like a fun romp through a halloween horror night at the amusement park with friends— thrills and cheap scares to behold. It's a small slow start but once shit hits the fan, holy shit, it doesn't STOP. Entertainment value aside, there wasn't much plot or character depth to begin with or anyone we're really caring for B U T......the mc was extremely tough and strong headed and I really liked that. Other than rooting for her, I didn't really care for anyone else that much. But who cares! We ain't here for them, we're just here for that body count, and boy does it deliverrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Twist(s)?? There was a really fun twist on the serial killer and slasher trope overall that I reallllllllyyy liked. But the m o t i v e??? Let's pretend I don't see it. This book is just a good time and a fun time. Highly at that. If you liked There's Someone Inside Your House, but didn't like the romance or reveals......well then folks, this is the book for you!! Add this to your Halloween TBR, folks! Just wished a bit more on the ending but overall a super great fun bloody soaked read for a dark dark night. 4.5 BLOODY STARS"
Chalktrauma,David  DeGeorge,3.25,"This book started out with an intense situation between a teacher and student that captures your attention right away. The story centers around four high school seniors, close friends, that are in a trigonometry class together. Feeling invincible, as most high school seniors do, they sometimes push class behavior, tardiness and authority figures to the limit. When their trigonometry teacher unexpectedly passes away, a young, beautiful substitute teacher is assigned to take charge of the class. As usual, the class tries to show the substitute that they will do as they please and that she can't control their behavior. It doesn't take long for the teacher to take control of the class by running her fingernails down the chalkboard. For some reason her fingernails make a shrill piercing noise that permeates the students' body and soul. Covering their ears does nothing to dull the noise and when she stops, the students feel chilled, nauseous and weak. It takes a few times of the punishment before the class behaves. Sometimes, it seems like the teacher has super power hearing or eyes in the back of her head because one slight whisper or a passing note and the punishment begins. If there's a indiscretion by a single student, the teacher stares down the student so severely that her eyes become black. When that happens, within a short time the guilty student is injured or killed. The four friends compare observations of this ""power"" that this teacher has over others and a few serious and fatal events that have occurred to those students that have ""crossed"" her. Eventually, one of the four friends figures out a way to break her power over them. If they work together and support each other, they can remove her influence in their life. This story has twists and turns and it's hard to put down. I enjoyed the characters in this story, you get excellent descriptions of them and the area they live in and it seems like you go to high school and college with them. Reading this brings feelings of nostalgia, memories, and the carefree life of the teenager. Thank-you to David DeGeorge, Silver Leaf Books and Goodreads, for for the Giveaway I won and the opportunity to read and review this book. I appreciate the opportunity!","I received a copy of Chalktrauma in exchange for an honest review. I really wanted to enjoy this book. It had and interesting concept and appeared to be a book that would be right up my alley. Instead I was met with a book that took me far longer to read than I would have expected. I had tried to start reading this book multiple times only to stop reading it again and again. The book contained uninteresting characters I didn't really care for let alone care about what happened to them. These were supposed to be seniors in high school, however the way the characters spoke about specific subjects made them appear to be very immature and far younger than seniors in high school. I would have understood the characters perhaps being embarrassed about certain subjects but that is not how it came across. Some of the wording and terms they used had me thinking more of kids that were closer to preteen in age. The next issue I had with this book is it needed further editing, to the point where every few pages the wrong word was used, a word was missing, or the sentence ended in mid-thought causing me to be pulled out of the story.  Ultimately a fun idea for a book but with characters that were flat and unlikable along with the need of editing it left the book wanting and incapable of keeping my attention for more than a few minutes at a time.","**I received a copy of this title for free from the author in a goodreads giveaway. This does not affect my rating as such. Thank you, David DeGeorge!**DNF @ 17%I honestly feel bad, but I won't be moving forward with this book. Between the homophobic language on page one, lack of clear setting, the sexual nature of this teacher's relationship with their students, and strange characterizations I'm having a hard time wanting to pick this up. I was also skimming through sections just to move the plot forward and nothing is really different between page 71 and page 10."
What Our Minds Once Were,Joe Baldwin,3.78,What a cool read!,"Quick readOverall, not a bad collection of stories. I used as a palate cleanser from the all the fantasy books I have been reading",NA
Ward D,Freida McFadden,3.98,"Thank you Dreamscape Media for the audio ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are ALWAYS honest. Earhole & eyeball read   Writing: third grade | Plot: swiss cheese | Ending: ??????  SYNOPSIS Medical student Amy tries to survive a night on Ward D.  MY OPINION LMFAOOOOOOOOO. Ight let's get some things outta the way:1. If you're a diehard Freida McFan and you can't stand to see her books being slandered: look away. There's 401904 other positive reviews, so go chat amongst yourself. This is a hating safe space 😂 2. Why did I read this despite my track record with Freida (allegedly) McFraudulent? Because it's my constitutional right to be a certified dummy and I will continue to exercise said right.3. Before you comment ""it's just fiction"", check your own reviews to make sure you haven't whined about a fictional dog death, racism, sexism etc. If you have and you're just pulling the ""it's just fiction"" card as a Freida stan, kindly see #1. Thank you. 4. I removed the quotes from my original review as Freida did make small edits.OK. NOW LET'S GET INTO IT!!!!!!The writing was piss poor and Amy was as lost as a wet fart in the wind. Jfc. I thought Millie from The Housemaid was a certified dumb-dumb, but Amy said hold my peach iced tea (IYKYK). Also, the narrator's voice made her sound even more immature and daft, so if you want to locate a shred of respect for our dear FMC, I recommend reading with you eyeballs. I'm sorry but even a three-year-old couldn't be gaslighted into thinking that RED JELLY was blood and vice versa. Cmon now. Show me a little respect and go with the ketchup instead. Or even some canned spaghetti-o sauce. You can leave the spaghetti-os in it tbh, still better than RED JELLY????Oh and it wouldn't be a Freida book without unrelentingly repetitiveness and her cheap magician trick of shoving something down your throat in a not-so-subtle-way as a distraction from the grand finale. Within 10 pages – I'm not exaggerating (for once) – she writes: ""But I have to remember that I am talking to a man with paranoid schizophrenia. A man who has been hearing voices.""   ""But I have to remind myself again that paranoia is part of his diagnosis."" and one more time for the people in the back...  ""...And I remind myself that Will himself is not entirely benign. This is a man who's been hearing voices."" JFC even if I had dementia, I wouldn't have enough time between each mention of his paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis to forget about it. Absolutely brutal. Editor – if you exist – where the fuck are you?????? Somebody file a missing person's report.Ok so I think the fun has gone on long enough, but just in case you aren't convinced that this is an absolute shit show, let me leave you with this stunning excerpt from the epilogue: ""I swivel my head to watch the barista making a drink, observing the steps with great fascination. I wonder how they know how to make all those drinks. Do they take some course to learn? Coffee 101?""  LMFAOOOOOO this is giving me 1) person just escaped from a cult and is discovering modern day society for the first time and 2) a mom saying ""awww that's great sweetie"" when their young child shares a picture of an alleged horse that looks more like roadkill. All in all, if you can refrain from having one critical thought while reading this, there's definite entertainment value abound. I'm sure this will be another chart-topper that I'll see in every other TikTok about ""shocking thrillers"", so congrats I guess.  PROS AND CONS Pros: I now know, without a shadow of a doubt, this author is NOT for me Cons: Did I stutter?","After many comments on my review I’m changing it. I didn’t like the book, the main character was extremely unlikeable and I kept rolling my eyes when reading what she thought and did. The plot was unlikely and sometimes hilariously so, like watching a very bad horror movie. And I know many feel (as do I) that the mental health representation was quite bad. I’ve heard McFadden changed the number of times she wrote ‘crazy’ as there was an overwhelming number of it.","Listen. The mental illness rep in this book is GARBAGE however I definitely do not read Freida McFadden for anyyyything to be realistic LOL. This was quick, bingeable, and had unpredictable twists which is what I wanted from it."
The Locked Door,Freida McFadden,4.00,"I’m just not fully understanding the plethora of brilliant ratings for this very mediocre novel. The entire story is reminiscent of In My Father's Basement, but without the intense character development and attention to detail that made Payne’s tale a solid stroke of genius. Instead, the brusque, straightforward style employed by author Freida McFadden is almost too simplistic. The attempt here to portray Nora as a potential heir to her father’s murderous throne comes across as elementary in technique and is never completely convincing, while the final epilogue seals the book’s fate as a valiant effort, minus the “valiant”.",4.3,"★ 1.5 starsfirst one star rating of the year! who cheered? (not me).oh wow... what a huge disappointment. this book is legit one of the most boring and unimpressive psychological thrillers i’ve ever come across. it missed the mark in every single way.the first book i’ve read by Freida McFadden was The Housemaid, it was pretty cool, thrilling and had me hooked from beginning to end. then, after that, i was motivated to pick another book by her and i chose Never Lie, i must confess that it was not as good and thrilling — but it was not terrible given the fact that i could enjoy some aspects of it, so i was like “alright, i won’t give up on her, she has a bunch of other books that might be great and i’ll give them a try eventually” and that’s what i did. saw this one on my tbr and i felt like it was the perfect moment to read it. the positive reviews made me beyond excited to start it and see what the fuss was all about. and now that i’m finished, i don’t understand what the fuss was all about. not even a bit. am i the problem? or is the book the problem? i don’t know, i feel like it’s the second option.this book is advertised as being a “Gripping psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist.” BUT WHERE?!clearly, i’ve been lied to because this is definitely not a gripping psychological thriller with a twist capable of making my jaw drop. i want a refund immediately, please and thank you.i really thought this book sounded promising — but as soon as i started reading it, i changed my mind. not even 30 pages in and i was already wanting to dnf. not a good sign, right? now that i’m looking back, i probably should’ve given up at the beginning because this was a complete waste of my time. there’s not even a single thing that made my experience worth it. everything failed to captivate me.the main character, Nora, got on my nerves. god, i absolutely loathed this woman! she was extremely insufferable and literally had no personality besides being irritating, whiny, rude and very stupid. she managed to annoy me from beginning to end. what’s up with Freida always writing unlikeable female main characters that have the personality of a personality of a cardboard box? i don’t know if she does that on purpose or if she just doesn’t know how to write a female main character with a nice and remarkable personality. either way; it’s time for that to change, ma’am. imagine how tired we are.to make things even worse, the story itself was dreadfully tedious. for a thriller, this literally offers no thrill whatsoever — instead, it offers a weak, repetitive and badly-written plot with little to no suspense and boring twists that are predictable. the big twist at the end was not easy to predict, though. but wait, don’t get the wrong impression, i didn’t mean it in a positive way. just because it wasn’t predictable, it doesn’t mean that it was good or shocking. it was neither of these things. the author just came up with a lazy reveal that was unbelievable and nonsensical, it came out of nowhere. ridiculous.i love thrillers, it’s one of my favorite genres, but lately it’s been so hard to find a good one with an amazing plot and a surprising twist. i’m exhausted... all in all, The Locked Door is a book that i’d rather forget. i wish i hadn’t wasted my precious time reading it. sure, the premise was cool, but it was badly executed. we all know that good ideas don’t mean anything when they come from an author who doesn’t know how to execute them well. do i recommend it? well, i would be lying if i said yes (sorry). but if you still want to give it a try, i really hope you have a different experience. good luck!─────────────────────➷ pre-review:been craving a thriller so i decided to start this one! sounds promising 👀 let’s hope it delivers because the last thrillers i read were all bland and disappointing... 🫣"
That's Not My Name,Megan Lally,4.06,"I feel gutted after reading this one, and will definitely need something more uplifting now.","They call me hellThey call me Sta-ceyThey call me HerThey call me Jane---------------I've been reading less and less young adult thrillers these days, as the majority of them are just... not good. I decided to pick this one up due to the surprisingly high community rating, and was rewarded with a gripping, emotional story that I flew through in a few days.This is a dual POV, told from a girl who believes her name is Mary, picked up by her father after an accident triggers amnesia, and Drew, whose girlfriend Lola disappeared one night, leaving him the prime suspect of the investigation. There was a constant question of if Mary really was Lola, and who this father figure really was.I really liked the ending. The story stays grounded in reality throughout, making this feel like something that could really happen, and the emotional scenes were so well written it made the characters stand out and feel like real people. This is the author's debut, and I'm so excited to see what she writes next.","Wow! This is another one of my fastest reads. I was able to devour this book in one sitting, completely drawn into the mystery of a seventeen-year-old girl who wakes up in a ditch, covered in blood, with a crushed nose and a lump on her head, in the middle of nowhere. She has no idea who she is. At the same time, there's Drew, another seventeen-year-old boy accused of the disappearance or presumed murder of his girlfriend, Lola. Are these two events connected?However, the girl who lost her memory has already been taken home by her worried dad, who drove her from the station and told her a story about meeting her in a cabin. She might have had a car accident, and her name is Mary, so she's not the same missing girl Drew is accused of killing, even though her body hasn't been found. Officer Roane is determined to pin the crime on him to provide closure to the very concerned citizens of the small town.As Mary spends more time with her overprotective dad, his conservative and controlling ways, which prevent her from going outside without a disguise, raise questions in her mind. Why can't she remember him? But, most importantly, why can't she remember who she really is?Meanwhile, the town's shunned boy, Drew, is determined to unravel the mystery of his missing girlfriend. Guilt eats away at him because he let her go on the night she disappeared. Can he piece together the clues and track down Lola's location, which may lead him to the cabin where Mary resides and provide the answers he's looking for? Could these two mysteries be connected?Overall, this is a well-written, heart-throbbing, riveting, and exciting page-turner that you shouldn't miss. I initially planned to give it four stars, but the epilogue featuring Drew affected me more than I expected and brought tears to my eyes. So, I've added half a star and rounded up my rating to 4.5 stars! I'm eagerly looking forward to reading more works by this author in the near future.Many thanks to NetGalley and SOURCEBOOKS Fire for providing me with this unputdownable book's digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter"
One by One,Freida McFadden,3.86,"I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",4.5⭐️ PLOT TWIST WOAH,That was FUN. Couldn’t put it down!
One Dark Window,Rachel Gillig,4.28,"Regrettably, One Dark Window wasn't it for me.I have 2 reviews: a constructive one and a silly one. Here is my more sensible take (silly review at the end) ~~Why One Dark Window didn't work for meWorldbuilding (+ naming conventions):The world of Blunder is very textureless. We learn that there's a Wood and a Mist, but little else. The upper classes all have tree-related surnames (Hawthorn, Yew, Rowan, Willow, Laburnum), presumably from the Wood's place in their culture, but the genesis of this tradition isn't explored. Why this fantasy world has the same trees as we do on our Earth isn't explained, either. Author Rachel Gillig didn't go out of her way to create wholesale her own unique fantasy world, but so little gets described about Blunder's environment, time period, aesthetics (architecture, fashions), and culture (food, music, values) that I can't say she drew particular inspiration from anyone in our history, either. She did, however, use a variety of names from multiple real-world cultures - Elspeth (Scottish), Ione (Greek), Hauth (Anglo-Saxon), Jespyr (Dutch), Dimia (Russian), Nya (Norse), Emory (English). While these names are all equally uncommon, the lack of consistency renders Blunder's naming conventions arbitrary, further diminishing the worldbuilding.So at least the world being named ""Blunder"" was appropriate...The name 'Ravyn':I'm sorry; I just can't get over this. This name is just too silly.In keeping with Blunder's naming conventions of just being whatever, the love interest's name is Ravyn. With a Y. Mind you, there are other characters with inexplicable Ys in their names - Jespyr, Alyx, Tyrn - but it was Ravyn that did me in. I said before it's like an AIM username: ~*~Ravyn666~*~ or something edgelord like that. And just hearing it tells you all you need to know about him. Dark, broody, taciturn, hawt boi.Too many moving parts (but they got rusted over from disuse so they weren't really moving...):Creepy magical forest. Creepy magical mist. Creepy magical illness. Creepy magical playing cards. Creepy magical monster in head. Creepy magical undead king. There is also court intrigue, heists, and fake dating in the mix. While all of these plot points are more or less related, there are simply too many of them. This surfeit ensures none get explored fully, resulting in scenes like this:Jespyr: We think this lord might have a super special trading card we need. Elspeth, see if he has it.*Elspeth has lunch with that lord's daughter*Elspeth: Say, your dad doesn't have any cool trading cards, does he?Lord's Daughter: Nah, just a boring [EXACT CARD THEY NEED]Elspeth: Lit*Team proceeds to rob Lord of super special trading card*Furthermore, many plots get sacrificed for one Gillig was clearly more invested in... that being~~The Romance:In theory, I do like forced proximity as a trope; I mean, propinquity was why Zelda Gilroy thought she and Dobie Gillis were meant to be 💕 But all intrigue gets lost when it's too obvious, and in One Dark Window, there is no ambiguity that Elspeth and Ravyn will get together. She thinks he's hot from the jump, and immediately gets butthurt when he resists fake courting her. When he holds her hand or helps her with her horse, she completely melts. And every situation in the book requires them to be together, like two animals caged together in a zoo in hopes they'll mate. No other love interests are introduced to threaten their being together. Sadly, they don't even have chemistry; the extent of their attraction is physical and trauma bonding.The Reveal:The Nightmare in Elspeth's head is the Shepherd King. This, unfortunately, comes as no surprise, as no other lore, history, or magic backstory is provided for it to be anyone but who it is.I saw Gillig make a TikTok poking fun at how dense Elspeth is for not putting two-and-two together about the Nightmare's identity...but isn't that just a self-own? She chose to craft a mystery with only one possible suspect by virtue of the sparseness of her fantasy world.Here's what I was hoping, though I knew it wouldn't come true: That the Nightmare would've been Elspeth's lost mother Iris, transmuted by the magic into a wraithlike creature. It was mentioned early on that Iris had first taught her about the magic cards; perhaps her dealings with them had done something awful to her. As Elspeth had significant family trauma, I thought this twist would allow her to confront it - esp. her mother's untimely demise - and be able to help release her mother's spirit, allowing both women some semblance of peace.The Ending:Recently, I read Tracy Deonn's Bloodmarked, the sequel to the superlative Legendborn. Interestingly, One Dark Window comes to a very similar conclusion to Bloodmarked: Both protagonists get wholly possessed by the supernatural forces in their lives; Elspeth by the Shepherd King and Bree by King Arthur. In Bloodmarked, this event carries so much more weight. Being a book that challenges the oppression and perceived disposability of women of color, this is yet another attack on the autonomy of a black body by a white person with power. It's an injustice and rightfully horrifying.What Gillig does with this similar situation is to...just use it as a spooky ooky ending? Perhaps if I cared more about Elspeth this would have been shocking, but, really, the Nightmare was already running that whole show. Everything interesting about her came from the Nightmare, so...maybe this is actually an improvement?Final Thoughts:Have you ever played Final Fantasy VIII? Do you remember Triple Triad, its extremely frustrating playing card minigame? One Dark Window is the Triple Triad experience. A bunch of cool cards, but vague rules, aggravating inconsistency, and an unnecessary experience (for me, at least).~~~~~~And now here's my short, dum-dum review: Reading One Dark Window made me feel like One Dumb Bimbo for picking it up lol","i was so worried going into this. the synopsis sounded so interesting, but its compared to “uprooted” and “for the wolf,” both of which i rated 2 stars. so i really didnt know if i was going to enjoy this. but im so glad i decided to give it a try anyway.because, like the synopsis suggests, this is indeed a really interesting story! i love the concept of providence cards, the way the magic in the world works, the main mission/quest, and the mystery of the mist tied in with local folklore and legend. i also found all of the characters to be quite developed and enjoyed how they interacted with each other, the world, and the magic - particularly elspeth x nightmare and elspeth x ravyn. this is definitely a book that, once it ended, i wanted to grab the sequel and read immediately. so i have high hopes for and am looking forward to seeing how the story progresses!↠ 4.5 stars","gothic romantic fantasies will remain on top as long as they are written this way. i’d go to the front lines for Elspeth and Ravyn‼️ ALL TEN TOES DOWN FOR THEM 😤my god this was too mf good. i can’t even form words to express my love for this book. so ill try my best here. everything was a hit! the magic system. the characters. the found family. the romance. the plot. my scalp was tingling.our head girl Elspeth basically has this monster’s soul living inside of her. kinda like how Venom lives inside of Eddie Brock. this is her “curse” of sorts. having a sassy tongued creature keep her in check 24/7. then Elspeth meets homeboy (my husband) Ravyn Yew, with his knife to her chest but she beats his ass (literally) and runs ways. later they find out they have a similar problem and are off on this quest. they’re lots of slow heated moments and stolen glances. long story short: it’s kinda hard for them to break the law while they’re on this quest since the kings son is a living menace. iykyk this book dehydrated me. because tell me why i let go of all responsibilities in my life to read this book? drinking water included.Ravyn the man that you are. had me blushing left and right. the way he so effortlessly protects Elspeth. someone give him a medal. he’s so sassy and funny and fierce and loyal to his girl since page 1. **Elspeth and Ravyn having a hot moment with their clothes being ripped off**Ravyn: “Can i kiss you?”Elspeth: “A bit late to ask, isn’t it?”Ravyn: “Not on your mouth, Elspeth”**lowers himself to his knees***me: pointing a gun at my head 4.5 ⭐️"
Hidden Pictures,Jason Rekulak,4.16,"What in the right-wing propaganda thriller bullshit is this? Racism, transphobia, fatphobia, and atheist hating all in one. And it won the goodreads choice awards?? Yikes, folks. I’ll either be back to write a five paragraph essay on why I hated this or I’ll try to scrub it from my brain and pretend I never read it....Ok, I have more to say. Here we go.This book is a house of cards, built upon flimsy right-wing dog whistles, hoping no one puts together the pieces to realize just how hateful it is.We start with an overtly religious protagonist encountering atheists who are painted as superior and intolerant for not wanting religion brought into their home (which is, of course, a completely fair and reasonable thing for parents to ask of a Nanny), and while it's not nearly as serious as what's to come, my spidey senses started tingling. Clearly, the author's biases are showing here, as side characters confirm just how awful atheists are for thinking they're right which is... just silly considering most people tend to think their beliefs are correct. That's kind of how belief (or lack thereof) works. I would expect a Christian to believe in their God just as wholeheartedly as I, as an atheist, don't believe in any. If an atheist is superior for this line of thinking, so are the religious. But of course, this simple logic doesn't have a place in the carefully constructed narrative Mr. Rekulak is building.Then we have the fatphobia. Constant little quips about characters' body size tied to their worth as a person. Most blatantly obvious when it comes to the MCs mother, who was unable to help her daughter with her drug addiction because she was fat (????)... which, literally makes no sense and is just fatphobic for the sake of being fatphobic. She loses weight later, though, so we know she and MC will heal their relationship. Great.One side character, who we are meant to like (I think) but is actually awful, is pretty outright racist to our MC's love interest and... it's never called out or addressed. She's just *qUiRky* and into *mYstiCAl* shit so I guess we're supposed to laugh it off? No thanks. The transphobia comes out near the end, as the ""twist"" of this thriller. Turns out the child our MC is caring for was kidnapped by her Evil Atheist ParentsTM and forced to live as a boy to hide their identity and also, it seems, because they just wanted a son rather than a daughter. Now, there is so much that isn't ok here.Not only is this book painting the LUDICROUS idea that any trans child is being forced to be so by their *woke leftist* parents as legitimate, validating this hateful idea that erases the experiences of trans kids who have healthy and open relationships with their parents and are given the freedom to be themselves, but it's whipping up fear in its target demographic, giving them yet another reason to be openly transphobic. Those who love this book and are telling me in the comments of this review (and many others) that this is proof that trans kids are being forced into it by their parents just prove my point. We ALL agree that forcing kids to live as someone they're not is wrong. That's why we should be supporting children in their exploration of their sexuality and gender, giving them a safe space to figure out who they are, and loving them unconditionally. Yes, even if it turns out that they're trans.The author is not-so-subtly calling out to his fellow close-minded bigots, hoping to squeak by unnoticed by the rest of the literary world. And it's gross. If you're going to be a sh*tty human, feel free to say it with your whole chest.If you can't understand why using the gender of a very young child as a twist in a thriller is in bad taste, I'm not exactly sure how to help you.Trigger/Content Warnings: transphobia, fatphobia, racism, kidnapping, murder, addictionYou can watch me review this book & all of the other 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards Winners here: https://youtu.be/fFKXJ1gsZA8You can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club","I try to approach books with minimal expectations. After all, there's nothing more disappointing than going into a much-hyped book with glee and coming out with vague puzzlement about whether we all read the same book. But try as I may, I often can't help myself. The heart wants what it wants, for why else would I be reading in the first place if not to be blown away?And so I cracked open Hidden Pictures with my usual mix of tempered yet hopeful anticipation, waiting to see which way this book would fall. And I tell you, I knew from almost the very beginning. I was only four pages in when I dropped my library ebook, ran out to my local bookstore, and bought a physical copy so that I could own what I hoped would be a new favorite. And I was right.Talk about a riveting experience. From the first page to the last, this book had me hooked. I didn't just read it, I inhaled it. The pages slipped through my hands and before I knew it, hours had passed. It's exactly the sort of immersiveness I love and crave in a story. There is so much tension in here, my spine tingled from it. It was the perfect mix of spooky (not too much), thrilling (very), and mystery (puzzling), and I just ate it up. The mystery, in particularly, was compelling and fun, and I totally enjoyed armchair detecting along with Mallory as she tried to figure out what was going on.The use of drawings in here has to be a stroke of genius. They are such an integral part of the story and added so much to the spooky ambience. It made it feel like I was reading something special and inimitable. And—let's be honest—even though we're all grownups, I bet we still get pretty excited when we see illustrations in our books, amirite?That isn't to say this book is without flaws. In terms of sheer funness, the first half of the book definitely has the second half beat. That's probably because setting up a story isn't quite the same as finishing it. So as we start to approach the denouement with all of its twists and turns, there was a noticeable change in the vibe of the story. It went from the perfect amount of spine-tingling thrill to more of eyebrow-raising crazy chaos.Which brings me to the question: can a story have too many twists? I think so, and I think that's what happened here. The main mystery is already interesting enough, but I think this book went a bit overboard as it wrapped everything up. The twists piled upon twists at the end started to max out my dopamine receptors, and all I felt was numbness in the face of so much mayhem.But those are minor quibbles in the overall scheme of how much I enjoyed this story. In fact, I had so much fun that if I'm ranking books based solely on that criteria, this would have to be near the top. Just for that alone, and for how memorable it is, it gets all 5 stars from me.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Last One at the Wedding~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","Oh my goodness! This is absolutely fantastic! There are so many aspects that I absolutely adored while reading this book: the chilling atmosphere of the guest house, the clever incorporation of famous horror movie themes like ""Ring"" and ""Insidious,"" the masterful storytelling that keeps you on the edge of your seat, the spine-tingling sensation of constantly feeling like someone is watching over you, and those final twists that hit you like a slap in the face because they're so unexpected!I have to say, this is one of the best things I've read in a long time! The seamless blend of horror, psychological thriller, mystery, and suspense genres is simply perfect.Let me give you a quick recap of the events that unfold in this gripping tale:We meet Mallory Quinn, a 21-year-old survivor with a tragic past and a history of addiction. After 18 months of sobriety, she's ready to start a new chapter in her life. With the help of her sponsor, she lands a summer job as a nanny for five-year-old Teddy, the son of Caroline and Ted Maxwell. The Maxwells are staunch believers in science, atheists who have a strict set of rules for Mallory to follow, including no drug use or fooling around.Mallory is relieved to have a place to stay and a job that pays well enough for her to save money for her future plans. However, strange scratching sounds coming from the guest house in the middle of the night and the eerie sensation of being watched leave her restless. When she discovers that a woman may have been killed in that very guest house, her anxiety reaches new heights.As if that wasn't enough, little Teddy keeps conversing with his eerie imaginary friend, Anya, behind closed doors. He even draws disturbing pictures of Anya being dragged into the woods and buried in a hole. Each day, Teddy's drawings become more detailed and sophisticated, as if they were created by an adult. Mallory's neighbor, who might have some mystical abilities, warns her that a spirit may be using Teddy's body as a vessel. When Mallory shares her theories with the parents, they dismiss her as losing her mind. What will Mallory do as the threat of something sinister looms over the house? Can she protect Teddy, and perhaps even herself?The story unfolds in an unconventional and highly enjoyable manner. I wholeheartedly, absolutely, and without a doubt recommend it to everyone. It's a must-read that will leave you hooked from start to finish!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
Home Is Where the Bodies Are,Jeneva Rose,3.81,"*Pinches bridge of nose in stress*hooooooooo my gawd... are you actually kidding me!?I don't even want to spend to long on this, but lets go! (proceeds to write a dissertation)Home Is Where the Bodies Are is about three siblings reuniting back in their small home town after their mother passes. The eldest daughter Beth was with her mum right until her last breath and the mother's parting words are 'Don't Trust...' Dun Dun Dun! Ooooh looks like we have a mystery to solve Scooby!While the three siblings are sorting out the estate they stumble upon old VHS home videos of their childhood and on one of the videos there's a shocking scene of the siblings father covered in blood and making a shocking announcement. 🙄⋆｡°✩WHAT I LIKED⋆｡°✩➽ Very easy simplistic writing➽ Short Chapters➽ Can binge in one sitting ⋆｡°✩WHAT I DIDNT LIKE⋆｡°✩➽ THE WHOOOOOLE PLOT!➽ Predictable AF➽ Boring cliché one dimensional characters ➽ The 4 POVS was so unnecessary. The eldest daughter and the mums POV would've sufficed ➽ Absolutely no effort, to be original in any sense of the word. ➽ No suspense, no atmosphere... just dry ➽ Having to wait till the last 20% for a smidge of predictable action ➽ Was the Thriller and the Mystery in the room with us????????? WOW! Nothing hurts more than when an anticipated reads flops and sinks deeper than the Titanic! It's time's like this i am so grateful i make use of my library, because this would have pained me sooo much more had i spent my hard earned coins on this debacle! The pain in my chest when i guessed where this book was heading in like the first few chapters is outrageous, and only for it to then be confirmed...💔. Dare I say the predictability of this book is borderline offensive! The last book i read from the author was 'You Shouldn't Have Come Here' (utter mess) and you know what you're right Jeneva! I should have just sat here and minding my damn business. But the cover art of this book was too damn alluring and i have to give her major props on that! I'm looking at that current rating on this book and its sitting on a 4.06... so clearly i am an outlier here, but nope! This was just not it for me and too see that some of my favourite authors co-signed this book...😢 (bombastic side eye)Ummm would i call this a palette cleanser? hmmm if you like. It's one of those ones you could just listen to mindlessly while doing a bunch of chores or stuck at your office desk i guess? 1.5 ⭐------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩YOU have no idea how much I have been anticipating this read since i saw the cover! The cover alone is worthy of at least 2 stars!⭐Fingers crossed this gets the full 5 stars! ⭐🤞🏾🖤","With publication day for 'Home is Where the Bodies Are' fast approaching, I wanted to share a little insight on some of the heavy topics in this novel. Although, this is a fictional story, it's a deeply personal one for me as I was able to write about things I've personally dealt with in my life, through the characters of Beth, Nicole, and Michael. Addiction, death, and grief are heavy themes in this book, and they've also been themes in my personal life for a long time now. It was cathartic to write Beth, for I have felt like Beth when it comes to dealing with a person suffering from addiction. Through her, I was able to express a fraction of the emotional toll it's taken on me, while also allowing myself a little grace for the guilt I endure in still having been unsuccessful in helping them to recover. It was also cathartic to write Nicole, to put myself in the shoes of said person with some of their insights guiding me and giving me a glimpse at life from their point of view. I'm grateful for having the opportunity to write this book, and I thank you for reading it.","I will accept no slander on this one. If life didn’t life I would have read in one sitting. Loved the POVs, unreliable characters & that every theory I formed was wrong."
"Love, Mom",Iliana Xander,4.26,"A mother dies and her daughter starts getting mysterious letters written by her mother that seem to point to her mother doing crazy things. Seems interesting in theory, but I just did not like it. It was something about the writing style that felt very bland to me.I read this because I saw several awesome reviews about the twists in this book, but I did not find them exciting like others did. I think this might have been a me problem, but this book was not for me.",This is one of the BEST psychological thrillers I've read. I had to pick my jaw up off the ground when an unfathomable twist came in the second part. I highly recommend that all thriller fans read this immediately!,Booktok did me so dirty. Everyone saying how amazing it is 🙄. IT. WAS. NOT. AMAZING. 👏🏽
You Shouldn't Have Come Here,Jeneva Rose,3.35,"At the risk of being bullied by the author, I’m going to say it. I found zero redeeming qualities in this book. The entire book is a weird, uncomfortable slow burn of a romance (maybe?). Grace needs a break from her city life so she lands in a Wisconsin Airbnb for a week and a half. She meets country boy, Calvin and the two just have this weird sexual tension. Grace seems to be teasing him, and Calvin seems to be falling head over heels. All the side characters are also uncomfortable. I can’t think of a better word than that. Generic and uncomfortable. Spoiler but not really - the huge plot twist is that one of the people we meet in the book is just a cold hearted serial killer who likes to kill people for no explained reason. You don’t find this out until the last 20 or so pages, and I found this to be the biggest cop out of a “thriller twist” that I’ve ever seen in a book. It’s like this whole quasi build up and then BAM “PLOT TWIST” - oh this person is just a serial killer lol. Mind you, if you want to even get to the end, you need to make it through the writing that makes you want to dig an ice pick into your eyes (or ears if you’re listening). The entire book reads like a middle school essay where the author was just taught about similes, metaphors, and analogies and told to write a story using as many as she possibly could. Not kidding, you can’t get through two sentences without something being compared to something seemingly completely unrelated, and it is laughably distracting. I am talking about a vagina being “like the cool side of a pillow,” and a girl being, “like an onion I want to rub all over my body to use as insect repellent.” I swear that an object can’t be mentioned without an obnoxious literary device comparing it to something else. Overall, I felt like I was reading a satirical parody of a thriller book. I do appreciate the advanced reader copy from @scaredstraightreads (on Instagram) and Blackstone publishing. However, I can’t in good conscience recommend this book to anyone.","Nopeeeee, totally not for me. I just found this book SO over the top cringey. Too many eye rolling moments, moments where I was like people just don't act like this. I could have scratched my eyes out at the amount of times the MC's eyes were described as 'blue, blue'. BUT I'm obviously in the minority here with my thoughts and this could definitely work well for those who like romance and spice in their thrillers, I'm just more of a darker reader and this felt way too pop'corny' for me.","“You shouldn’t have read this”This was t E r R i B l E !!!!! Zero stars. Makes no sense. Read like a bad insta obsession romance for nearly the entirety. For the official record, nothing happens until the last 13 minutes of the audio format. How many pages might that be? The last 40? Idk. She tried to pull a Modglin at the end and it did not work. Worst read of the year."
Keep It in the Family,John Marrs,4.08,Oh my god???,THIS BOOK IS NUTS,"Thank you Amazon Publishing UK and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Disclaimer: if you like popcorn/commercial thrillers, this will probably work for you. Still give it a try. I think it could work as a mindless vacay read, or if you're new to the genre.   THE PLOT Mia and Finn buy a spooky abandoned home with hopes of turning it into their dream abode. But things quickly become a nightmare when they discover something unsavoury in the attic.  MY OPINION I could hardly contain my excitement when I saw this was Read Now on NetGalley. I snatched it up (it has since disappeared...) and dove into it ASAP. After loving The Good Samaritan and The One, I was looking forward to what the sick af mind of John Marrs whipped up this time. And well... it's one star, so you know the vibes. My streak of highly anticipated ARCs turning out to be the stankiest dookies of all time continues. So what went wrong? Let's start with the writing. This was the laziest first person narrative I've read in awhile. I call this ""dear diary writing"" where the character tells the reader directly wagwan like they're writing in their diary. Ie: ""Today I went to the store and saw John. I really like John. He has nice hair. He makes me feel special. Hopefully he likes me too."" Instead of writing a narrative that immerses the reader in the story so they're living the experience (and feeling all the feels too), this was written with the intent to just tell you what's happening as if you're an outsider looking in. BLEH. As usual when I'm reading a book with shockingly bad writing, I compare it to a previous work of the author to make sure I'm not trippin. I checked out The Good Samaritan again, and yep, still bangs. So this was just... off. All the characters were particularly unlikeable and obtuse. The ending was contrived. The twists were thrown in there for pure shock value only. There was no expertly crafted red herrings dropped along the way... it was painfully obvious what was coming coupled with a few random reveals that held no bearing. It felt like the author was shaking a magic 8 ball while writing this: should I add a twist here? Magic 8 ball says: YOLO! Go for it! Anyways, I'm going to cut myself off. It's one star. I HIGHLY recommend The Good Samaritan. An absolutely unhinged banger of a psychological thriller. It truly puts the psycho in psychological. Thank you, NEXT.  PROS AND CONS Pros: I got this while it was still available as a Read Now on NetGalleyCons: don't make me say it again..."
The Last One at the Wedding,Jason Rekulak,3.63,"I can never resist a wedding thriller. Call me a romantic, but nothing sets my heart aflutter quite like the prospect of murder and mayhem on that special day. So I went into The Last One at the Wedding with high expectations. But unfortunately, it disappointed from pretty much beginning to end.Frank hasn't spoken to his daughter Maggie in three years. So when he gets a phone call from her, he's rightfully thrilled. And he's even more so when he hears that she's getting married and wants him to walk her down the aisle. But when Frank arrives at the three-day wedding extravaganza, he starts to realize that all is not right. The story is told from Frank's perspective, and honestly, probably my biggest problem is that I just never connected with him. While I don't always have to love and be chummy chummy with all my protagonists, I do have to understand them. And I just couldn't get there with Frank.His paranoia reaches the level of making my eyes roll with practically every thought and every sentence. Sure, it eventually turns out that his paranoia is justified, for how else would we even have a story? But it didn't make reading his perspective any easier or any more fun.But it's more than that. For some reason, Frank came off as extremely unlikable. Now a lot of authors write unlikable characters, and they have no bearing or may even add to my enjoyment of the story. But in this case, I have the uncomfortable feeling that Jason Rekulak may have accidentally made Frank unlikable, that he thought he was crafting a personable guy and instead created a weird and bumbling one.There were so many moments when Frank would make an observation in his head or open his mouth to say something, and I would just cringe so hard. Like he saw a couple where the man is old and the woman is young and called them ""unnatural, a freakish mutation of human biology."" It felt so unnecessary and inappropriate, and I winced in embarrassment for him. And it was like this the whole way through.I tell you, it's hard to enjoy a story when you're wincing and cringing at the main character's every thought. I should've been focused on the thrills, but instead I was mired in second-hand embarrassment.But it wasn't just Frank. I felt like all the characters were slightly off, doing and saying things that no actual person would do and say in those situations. It's clear that each interaction was there to further a specific point in the plot line and they were shoehorned in to achieve that, no matter how awkward the result may be.As for the twists, they were fine, although with the weird characterizations, it made it hard for me to really buy in to them. It felt like characters were just randomly assigned roles in the reveal, and when the time came, their personalities were bent and changed to further that goal.So when we finally reached the end of the book, I understandably breathed a sigh of relief. But then I turned the page and there was a whole nother section left? I realize now that this is Rekulak's modus operandi. He likes to end his thrillers with a nice leisurely wrap-up, just to spell out in long form how everything works out for everyone, kind of like a HEA for thrillers. But there's a reason no one does them. I tolerated it for Hidden Pictures because I loved that story so much, but here, it just made a mediocre tale feel even longer.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Hidden Pictures~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","I can honestly say two things about this book: while it's a brilliant thriller with a unique plot, genuine characterization, and smart execution free from clichés and plot holes, it also brought me to tears during its most emotional moments. Perhaps readers who have experienced complex relationships with their fathers, or recently lost them, will resonate deeply with the story, just as I did. Fathers who reflect on their own parenting may also empathize with Frank’s struggles. And then there's Abigail—so endearing and innocent that I found myself wanting to protect her from the harsh realities and hidden dangers around her.This book feels distinct from ""Hidden Pictures,"" which garnered both praise and criticism—I honestly loved this one even more. The twists are absolutely jaw-dropping; there were moments when I screamed at the pages! I kept telling myself that some characters would never cross certain lines, yet they did, leaving me stunned.Now, onto the plot: Frank Szatowski, a Gulf War veteran and UPS driver for 26 years without an accident, has been estranged from his daughter Maggie for three years following a traumatic event. Raised by Frank with the help of his sister Tammy, who dedicates herself to caring for elders and foster children, Maggie reconnects with him out of the blue. She announces that she’s getting married and asks him to walk her down the aisle, giving Frank what feels like a second chance to make amends.But when Frank learns that Maggie's fiancé, Aidan Gardner, is an introverted artist specializing in eerie portraits and the son of a powerful tech billionaire, he grows uneasy. His suspicions only deepen during a tense dinner at Aidan’s luxurious Boston penthouse, where a secret stash hidden in the bathroom raises red flags.Determined to learn more about the Gardner family during the wedding festivities, Frank becomes increasingly alarmed. He notices Aidan's closeness to an art teacher who warns him about the family, and wonders why Maggie's future mother-in-law remains hidden during the celebrations. Rumors swirl that Aidan may be involved in the disappearance of a 21-year-old girl, or worse. When tragedy strikes at the wedding, Frank realizes he's racing against time to uncover the Gardners' secrets and protect his daughter, even at the risk of his own life.Overall, this is a fast-paced and gripping mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end, with shocking twists that catch you off guard. Frank is a flawed, stubborn, and grumpy character who might irritate you at times, but his imperfections make him all the more realistic and relatable—especially in his initially rough interactions with Abigail, though he redeems himself by the end.I'm giving it five stars for its well-developed characters and captivating mystery. The final chapters moved me to tears, and I highly recommend this book—it just might end up on my top ten thrillers list of 2024.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","So, I'm still not exactly sure how I feel about domestic suspense thrillers yet. But since I really enjoyed Hidden Pictures I was dying to get my hands on the next Jason Rekulak novel - and damn did he bring a cast of really great but also a mostly really unlikable cast of characters! I loved it!Happy release day! Now available! 10/8/24 🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️ೃ⁀➷ I received the audio - advanced listening copy and I just want to say that the narrator, John Pirhalla did such an amazing job at bringing Frank to life! Fantastic performance!In The Last One at the Wedding we follow Frank, our MMC when he gets a call from his estranged daughter, Maggie, inviting him to her wedding. They haven't spoken in years and Frank is surely chomping at the bit to see Maggie and make things right. However, she comes across very secretive with her invitation not to mention she doesn't tell him until he gets there -- at a very luxurious, private estate -- that she's marrying Aiden Gardner, the son of a tech billionaire. There is a ton of family drama on both sides, and Frank feels like something isn't right. He overhears mysterious conversations, and there's so many secrets, but the more he tries to find out about the family his daughter is marrying into, the more trouble he finds.ೃ⁀➷ While Rekulak's previous novel offers up a darker and more ominous feel - The Last One at the Wedding serves in a slower, more suspenseful way. Both are thrilling and entertaining but very different.ೃ⁀➷ There are many unexpected twists and turns that had me glued to the page, trying to work out my thoughts on who did this or who did that - trying to pin point who was the bad guy because there seems to be many of them in this story lol. It was an interesting and well-balanced blend of atmosphere, tension, horror, thriller, humor, heart, family drama, and conspiracy. Rekulak has done it again with another great cast of characters - they felt so real. Honestly, listening to the audio felt like listening to someone I know tell a story ... Friends of the family or something- just fantastic. I do recommend this book for anyone who loved a good domestic suspense thriller. ╰⪼ Family Secrets╰⪼ Wedding Drama╰⪼ Father/Daughter Relationships╰⪼ Rich People/Poor Behavior╰⪼ Single POV╰⪼ New Hampshire Fancy Lodge Setting╰⪼ Domestic Suspense/ThrillerMany thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio (😘) for the last minute advanced audio copy - all thoughts are my own. 💘"
Five Survive,Holly  Jackson,4.08,"I’m not sure what exactly I was expecting from this YA thriller, but having tears stream down my face towards the end was NOT on my agenda. Could I be the victim of a sudden paper allergy? Was someone cutting onions nearby?? Either way, ‘Five Survive’ had me hooked to the page and more invested than I ever consciously realized. Leave it to Holly Jackson I guess!!There must be some kind of magic in this book, because how in the world can you write 400 pages in the same setting, over just 8 hours, and somehow make it a page turner? A risk was taken, and the payoff was amazing! I think the secret and at least one of the reveals was a bit obvious, but I was shocked by the other plot twists and the balance between the two was incredibly enjoyable. I love solving something correctly to boost my ego a bit, while also having to scrape my jaw off the floor at times; it’s the perfect combination!Jackson is quickly becoming a favorite YA author of mine; it’s so hard to find adults who can write realistic teenage minds and interactions, and she hits the nail on the head every time! This novel was such a fantastic exploration on trauma, guilt, and how people transform once they're in a life threatening situation. Loved every page! SPOILERSAs far as characters go, I thought Red and Oliver in particular were very compelling and well developed; the latter especially was increasingly terrifying as the book went on, and I loved the juxtaposition between the him and the sniper as different kinds of antagonists. I do wish we got to see more of Arthur and Maddy’s personalities, but I understand that it was important for them to not be explored in depth until the end for the sake of the plot, and the reveals definitely made that worth it!In the end, I’m still not exactly sure how I feel about Arthur; Arthur and Red together to be specific. If I were her, I’m not sure I’d ever be able to trust him again, but they were pretty cute together, I cannot lie!! One of my favorite aspects of the book was how the very end mirrored the finale of the A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder series, it was such a heartfelt nod to Pip and Ravi but still distinctly Arthur and Red, I absolutely adored it. Overall, my expectations for ‘Five Survive’ were well exceeded; that scene with Red and her mother at the end?? I was crying like a baby, it was so beautifully done. Everything was tied up perfectly, while still leaving an open end for us to decide what happens, possibly my favorite way for a book to end.P.S. Maybe I just missed it, but did we ever find out the significance of the curtain pattern? I need to know, ok bye","i have conflicting feelings about this one. on one hand, the story is super fast-paced. the entire plot takes place over the span of 8 hours, so i guess it would have to be. the vast majority of the narrative (~80%) is dialogue, so that also contributes to the fast pacing. and these things are conducive for a good thriller, as nothing feels like its dragging. it definitely has a “keep you on the edge of your seat” kind of feel. that being said, i still managed to get somewhat bored with this. none of the characters are likeable and i didnt care if any of them died, the one setting itself (RV on the side of the road) isnt exciting, and the “secret” is very predictable. readers who enjoy a locked-in/cornered kind of scenario might enjoy this more than i did, but i personally dont think this is HJs best work. thank you for the ARC, random house/delacorte press!↠ 3 stars","(4.5 stars) Um. Wow. The ending has me kind of speechless. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻I will admit that it took me a littleeee bit to get into the book but once I did, it moved so. fast. The book is super fast paced and the ending is full of so many twists that I did not see coming. We also follow six very different characters. It was so interesting to read about their dynamic with one another, their secrets, and how they all react under the pressure of a life-or-death situation. PLUS, the whole story takes place in less than 24 hours inside an RV which is such a unique concept, setting, and timeline. I wasn't sure I could love a YA mystery as much as A Good Girls Guide to Murder, but Holly Jackson does it again 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"

    {{Disclaimer I write my review as I read}}
  
 ""Curious, I go to one of the windows in a bedroom I still don’t consider my own. Not technically. The room that once was mine and, in my mind, still sits across the hall, now vacant. This is my parents’ bedroom, where I rarely ventured as a child. Now, though, through a series of recent developments I’m still grappling with, it’s become my own."" Such a convoluted way of saying you have your parents old bedroom.  Omg talk about repetitive. We get the garage lights turned on. There are 5 garages we had to read about and their lights turned on.  He was 10 when his friend disappeared but he's able to just pull up in his memory that the presence he feels is his friends from 30 years ago.  You can already tell Ethan is this person who's going to be an unreliable narrator. He sees a garage light and instantly jumps to it must be someone that's going to kidnap a child. This is the first sign you're in a Riley Sager - characters just react with zero reasoning why they are. They also react over the smallest thing that a normal person wouldn't care about, but when real danger is near they don't even bat an eye.  We learn that Ethan suffers from insomnia but it's confusing how he works. He says he can only sleep for an hour or two at a time but then says he's accepted that he can't sleep from 1am - 4am. His therapist mentions it's guilt and anxiety with also the fear of being taken too that stops him from fully sleeping.  After Billy disappeared Ethan's parents send him to a private school away from them. What kind of parent comes that close to their child maybe being kidnapped and their first thought is to send your child away so you don't see them? Most parents would be more protective and want to keep their child close. I suppose moving away was not an option to his parents. Person moves back to the scene of the crime to get away from it all. Why would parents leave you the house where something that was so horrific happened to you?  Don't worry you'll hear about 
""The middle of the night""
 over & over. At least every chapter or at least it feels that way.  If the police think Billy just followed the kidnapper out of the tent why even cut it open? Wouldn't that be more noisy than just unzipping it? Okay and they follow only one set of footprints out into the woods so wouldn't that mean Billy walked himself out to the woods?  Ethan's whole personality is that one time his friend Billy got stolen. It's mentioned over and over. Doesn't Ethan think of anything else? We end one chapter talking about Billy's disappearance just to start the next chapter talking about it again.  Omg how ridiculous that the man cutting the grass would actually STOP what he is doing to knock on the door just to yell at the homeowners over a baseball. I'm sorry this was such a weird way to introduce us to the ball that Billy would throw into the yard.  On a complete whim Ethan calls the police to ask for updates and there actually is an update and they they actually actually tell Ethan. I get being the police officer that knows Ethan and what he's been through, but to tell him about what's going on with the case and finding remains seems ridiculous. Not only that, gathering 3 civilians together to tell them that Billy is dead when he doesn't even have the dental records back yet is nonsense. Ragesh even tells all of them before telling Billy's family. But why? What makes Ethan, Russ, and Ashley more important than the parent of Billy? Oh Andy is MIA, so I wonder if that'll come to something about what really happened to Billy.  So no one searched the huge lake 2 miles behind Billy's house because the owner told them not to (yeah, that's not suspicious).  Why are all the men so whiny sounding?  Ashley leaving Henry with Ethan makes little sense. She mentions that Henry barely knows Russ, but wouldn't he know Russ better than Ethan. Ethan has only met Henry one other time, but Russ has lived in the neighborhood the whole time plus Henry even recognizes Russ in the store. I get that Ashley has also just moved back but I don't understand how she trusts Ethan more. Couldn't she leave Henry with Russ' wife since she's home?  Speaking of Henry - I've noticed that whenever authors are inexperienced at writing children they tend to write them as these mini geniuses. They have the vocabulary of 40 year olds and can practically raise themselves. Russ talks Ethan into buying a top of the line trail cam. It's mentioned that he's nice enough to apply his employee discount (10%) to the purchase, but Russ owns the store so why would he have an employee discount? He's the owner and I've never heard of an owner having a discount to their own store. So now I'm over here thinking Russ is a dick for only giving 10% off an undisclosed priced trail cam when he could have done more.  Then there's this ""mystery"" that Ethan, Billy, Ragesh, Russ, and Ashley all together went 2 miles through the woods to the institute. Why would a 15 year old girl drag 10 year olds into the woods with her? Did this teenager have nothing else going on that she liked being surrounded by children?  Honestly I was beyond annoyed with Detective Palmer. She keeps asking Ethan who he thinks was behind the murder of Billy. At first he mentions someone at this secretive institution (that no one seems to know what they studied - somehow) and then he mentions the night before that someone was walking around neighbors yards, but she dismisses this with thee most outlandish answer; ""Unfortunately, that’s highly unlikely. Over the years, every known serial killer, kidnapper, and killer of children has been interviewed and asked about Billy Barringer. I’ve mentioned him to at least a dozen myself. Not a single one has confessed to the crime, which they love to do, even if they didn’t commit it."" Lots of serial killers hold back on people they've killed. To say that a serial killer aká murderer wouldn't actually made me laugh out loud. Yeah, you know those killers are one of the most truthful people in the world. Killers sometimes don't even admit to killing more people til years later.  Why did the author feel the need to repeat the name of the book ""The Giant Book of Ghosts, Spirits, and Spooks"" FOUR times??? (so far)  We are now getting this conversation that Billy was obsessed with ghosts and it's even mentioned that if he saw one he'd be nice to it and not run away. To this I keep thinking - did he think he saw a ghost that night and that's why he didn't scream, but instead followed it outside?  Why would Ethan still have all the small stuff in his room from when he was six years old? He did stay in this room on holidays and during the summer. The way the author writes it it's like Ethan never even returns to this room at all. I mean a teenager in a room for six year olds seems silly.  Okay that was creepy that a baseball rolled from the woods to Ethan's feet, but I keep thinking that someone wants Ethan to leave the house. Maybe there is something that will link that person to the house and they are trying to scare him out of it. So far I'm convinced it's Andy because I'm sure he knew about the baseballs and he's been missing for 10 years.  Why doesn't the trailcam ping when Ethan is in the yard - twice?  WOW it FINALLY happened! We got a queer moment! Johnny kissing Ragesh in the woods.  I keep thinking Claudia is dead. Just the way he keeps calling her, but she never calls him back.  So Hawthorne Institute is hosting weddings and private events, plus it has this amazing lake/waterfall, but someone is able to live on the land without anyone knowing for weeks. Author writes ""occasional wedding"" but we are knee deep in summer and summer time is prime wedding time so this place would be packed. I'm sorry it's weird to describe this location as a beautiful wedding location and then also say it has the occasional wedding while having a shack on the property that no one would check up on.  Here we have arrived in typical Riley fashion that women never worry about their safety. Ethan goes into the woods and finds the mansion. He's looking through the windows when a woman tells him to stop. He says he's here to look around. He doesn't have an appointment. When she asks about a car he says an Uber dropped him off. There is zero way a woman would continue to talk to this man being alone and in the middle of the woods with a stranger that just pops up out of the blue. He has no appointment and no car and he's looking through the windows. She even asks what kind of event he is planning and Ethan replies it's a wedding. She suggests he come back instead with his fiance but he says she's busy. Dude, no no no! Red flags for a woman all alone in the woods.  Omg Ethan who is lying about it being about a wedding asks zero things that deal with a wedding venue. When she is done with the tour he asks to use the restroom but then mentions that if he had done this the first time upon Lonette seeing him at the window it would have saved them both time - it makes no sense though;  •Would have been more weird to be in the woods and ask to use the restroom randomly w/ no car and on private property  •He wouldn't have known what the door by the bathroom was because he doesn't know where anything is in the house, so he'd know nothing about the basement Don't worry because he pretends to be so completely stupid he suddenly can't find the bathroom door that Lonette (again a woman all alone with a man that just turns up in the woods) gives up watching him and goes to her office. Thank god at least she called the police then.  I am so confused about the death of Billy. So someone took him to the woods, wrapped him in a blanket, threw him in the falls, took him out of the water (while wrapped in a blanket), and buried him. Why? Why would you do all of that?  Oh we find out that Ethan's mother worked at Hawthorne Institute. And we finally found out why she was fired. I do think it's odd how Ethan didn't know this is where his mother was working. His father and mother never had a conversation that mentioned her job or how odd it was working for the institute? She was fired because she saw them chanting and blood. I thought it would be more exciting. She then just signs an NDA because her boss tells her to. Also it makes little sense that she would drive over to her work on the off chance of finding a door unlocked to get into so she could get the watch. The watch has sat in her top drawer all week so not sure why she wouldn't have dropped it off before then. I know Ethan mentions he was a bad son for not paying attention that she worked there, but this kid listened to everything his parents would say before, so how would he suddenly turn off his hearing for this? The BIG reveal of who the boss is - Van de Veer is so underwhelming. We know absolutely nothing about this man and have only heard his name in a kind of passing. I was just like ""okay"". Then I started thinking wouldn't this dude have a better home if he's working for this millionaire? But he lives in this basic house.  Claudia is dead who could have seen that coming? Oh me, that's right. I knew she was dead from the moment he mentioned texting/calling her and her never returning his calls/texts.  I honest to God laughed out loud that Misty Chen moved out her bedroom just with the off chance that her son, Russ might do something bad. I get her being overprotective because her other son died, but it all seemed silly the way it was mentioned and how she knew Russ took the knife. Misty hides the knife under her bed but a few sentences later mentions removing the knife from the kitchen drawer to bury it.  Omg who didn't know it was going to be Andy who's behind all of this!!??  So Henry is missing (stolen by Andy and taken into the woods) they decide to make the hike into the woods - all 2 miles in the dark. Why would they waste that much time when they could have driven a car to the halfway point or to the actual Hawthorne Institute? They are in such a hurry to not waste the seconds to look both ways to cross the street, but no one thought driving would be faster? Plus let's remember this dude has only been in the woods one time in 30 years and he just leads the way in the 
  middle of the night
 without getting them lost or getting confused. Plus plus call the police while you are going!!  Omg dude Ethan is such a ham. Andy hasn't even said a world but good old Ethan is like ""I do know that Andy's not interested in Henry. I'm who he really wants. Henry was just a way to get me here."" How the hell does he just know that? There were countless times Andy could have had Ethan. I mean it ends up being true but Ethan just knowing was so ridiculous.  Poor Andy I guess he wasn't allowed to tag along with Billy and his friends, so he was lonely, but didn't he make any friends in school that he could hang out with?  Omgosh is this ever going to end? This book is so long and dull.  Having to reread what you already know that Ethan said to Billy as though it's something new from Andy. Dude didn't hear anymore than we already know so thanks for that.  I’m still completely lost on why Andy had to drag and torment Ethan like this. Why didn't he tell his mother when his brother was missing? Why didn't he approach the police as an adult? Why this dramatic moment when he didn't do anything but overhear the argument that he had to kidnap a child? ""The only reason that Andy stays quiet is because he's been told by everyone that Billy had been taken, most likely by a stranger who grabbed him after slashing the tent."" Could you imagine a 7 year old having this much insight to not tell anyone what they heard because they believe there's another plausible explanation?  Of course it was Ashley because the actions of all the characters make so little sense and the theories are held together with a string.  Oh so Billy WALKED in the woods barefoot for a mile. That would be absolutely so painful. I do know where this is going though - Ashley hit him with a car and dumped his body at the falls.  Yep. Ashley hit him. When we get the story at the ending it was never mentioned that there were tire marks from a fast stop on the road. It says she pounded the brakes so there would definitely be tire marks.  There's so many plot holes in this book;  •Why didn't Ethan tell the police that Billy had been caught in the woods earlier in the day and had even been at the institute the night before?  •Why wouldn't the police have searched the institute's area?  •Why did Ashley suddenly confess when Andy told her that he wasn't going to harm her son (he had no reason to) but now he'd be more motivated to since she killed his brother.  •Why didn't anyone think it was odd that on the night that Billy goes missing Ashley has a story about hitting a deer? Did the police not search people's houses and notice cars? They believed a car had picked up Billy at the road so wouldn’t checking cars in the neighborhood be important? Don't worry because once Andy gets a confession from Ashley he says thank you to her and then crumbles with Ethan as they cry.  Thanks Riley for another supernatural water scene. Billy to the rescue to guide his horrible friend to safety. I guess Billy's spirit was just waiting around (after his body was finally found) to just help Ethan. Somehow that was his unfinished business. It wasn't but they found his body. It wasn't that Ashley finally admitted to his death. No it was Ethan needing to be saved in the water that was his business keeping him on this Earth.  There's a part in the book where I feel like Riley Sager is telling you to grow up and not everything is so black and white. ""Ethan no longer bothers to venture, people even expressed disappointment that the truth was so mundane, so boringly human. There were no villains in the story. There were no heroes. Just a neighborhood of flawed people some more than others.""  The ending of this book certainly gave us a boring and underwhelming ending.  Oh my God then Ethan adopts Henry because Ashley asked him too. This is the most ludicrous thing in a book ever. So now Henry loses his mother after finding out she murdered another boy and he has to live with this complete stranger that he's only seen for a few weeks. This is crazy. Not only that but then Ethan agrees to this. ""Happy New Year, Dad"" hahaha!Final Thoughts: You know how Sager said it the first pov from a male perspective, well everyone gets a POV on the day of the murder. It's kind of like American Beauty where it shows what everyone is doing and building up to.  Had a lot of problems with this book. As if you couldn't already tell. The random multiple POV's. I hate the pov's of the children. The language they used and words were like college graduates. The cheesy ending. The characters are dumb. Honestly, I could go on and on. This book frustrated me to no end. It has a lot of plot holes and scenes that don't make sense when things are revealed. I'm still unsure why Andy hid in the woods and kidnapped a child to get Ethan to talk. I didn't understand why they called the cops if they didn't want Andy arrested. Why not just let him go after finding out about Ashley and then Ashley admitting to the crime when they got back to the houses?  
Thanks to Netgalley and Dutton publishing for this advanced ebook copy. All thoughts and opinions are my own. 
PS - no handyman in this one....","3.5* rounded up. I definitely enjoyed this, but I didn’t love it as much as I’d hoped to. This one felt like a pretty solid “middle-of-the-road” thriller to me. Not terrible, not great. I thought it had potential to be amazing, especially in the beginning, I was LOVING where I *thought* it was going but it just didn’t have me in the same chokehold as some of his others! I still recommend it though, it’s got great 90s nostalgia sprinkled in and an unpredictable twist for sure! Good for a summer popcorn thriller.","Funny thing is, as soon as I opened the first page of the book, Phil Collins’ “(Billy) Don’t Lose My Number” started playing in my head. I know there's not much resemblance or direct connection between the song and the plotline, but as an 80’s child, I listened to it while I kept reading because this book reminded me of my own childhood, friends, relationships with siblings, how I perceived my parents, and my neighborhood! It felt like a trip down memory lane!I’m not going to rate this book five stars, but I have to be fair—this is the most special book Riley Sager has created! It’s not a big mystery or an earth-shattering thriller with eye-popping, jaw-dropping revelations or a phenomenal paranormal scary story, but it’s a genuine, emotional, gripping mystery about grief, letting go, and being trapped in a spiral symbolized by Hemlock Circle. People are drawn there like magnets and can’t leave until they face their fears, secrets, and dark pasts. Ethan Marsh returns to his childhood house after 30 years, where one of the most tragic moments in his life occurred: his best friend and next-door neighbor, Billy, was taken from their camp tent in their backyard in a quiet, quaint New Jersey cul-de-sac while he was sleeping next to him. Someone sliced open the tent at night to take Billy, leaving Ethan behind. Unfortunately, Ethan has no idea what happened that night or who took his friend, leading to 30 years of insomnia and guilt that affect his ability to form a family and create conflicts with his wife. He only hears a screeching sound in his dreams and wakes up with no memory. He tried everything, including hypnosis, but his memory of that ominous night remains blocked.Now, due to financial and relationship issues, he’s forced to live in this house because his parents, retiring and moving to Florida, left him to take care of the place. As soon as he moves back into the house, facing Hemlock Circle and his old neighbors, he notices blinking lights. The next day, he finds a baseball left in the yard, similar to the baseballs Billy used to leave for him 30 years ago to summon him to play. Before he can connect the dots, he receives news that shatters his world: they finally found Billy’s remains. What if those baseballs and the blinking lights are signs from Billy’s spirit trying to connect with him? On the same day Billy was taken, five of them had visited a mysterious institute founded and funded by the rich philanthropist Ezra Hawthorne, where occultists tried to connect with spirits. During their visit, something happened to Billy that tested their friendship and questioned their bonds. Could his kidnapping be related to that day? After Ethan and his childhood babysitter Ashley return to the neighborhood, the circle closes. All five people who were at the institute the day Billy was taken have returned! Could Billy’s demise be connected to the secret institute, or was he taken by someone he knew in the neighborhood? Is this why Ethan cannot remember, because he’s afraid of uncovering the dark truth that may ruin his life? Overall, I liked the conclusion. Billy, Henry, and the entire group of weirdo bookish kids will always have a place in my heart. It takes one to know the other! This is a gripping, sentimental read about grief, longing, and guilt feelings that follow you throughout life until you learn to forgive yourself. I appreciate the dramatic and realistic execution. This is not a shocking, chilling thriller, but it’s still a well-written mystery that tugs at your heartstrings. I didn’t expect to become teary-eyed while reading a Riley Sager book, but I did, and it truly surprised me. That’s why I highly recommend this book to mystery lovers and to those who want to take a trip down their own childhood lane.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<————————————————————-Dear God,It's been torture waiting for the release date of Riley Siger's latest book, especially after my requests for ARC copies have been repeatedly rejected by the publishers.

The Shining,Stephen        King,4.28,"If you had not read The Shining already, the 2013 publication of Doctor Sleep, the sequel, presented an opportunity to revisit one of the best ghost stories of our time, a perfect justification for stepping through those bat-wing doors for the first time.  1st Edition cover – Published January 28, 1977 – 447 pps It has been a lifetime since I read The Shining for the first time, over thirty years ago. I enjoyed it then for its effectiveness in telling a scary, no, a very scary story. Reading it now is colored, as is all of life, by our accumulation (or lack of accumulation) of experience. We see, or appreciate colors, textures, shapes, structures, and feelings with more experienced, educated eyes. We have seen, or are at least aware of real world things that are scarier than any fictional spectres. So, what does it look like through old, cloudy lenses?It remains a very scary story. The things that stand out for me now are not so much the deader rising up out of a bathtub to pursue a curious child, although that is still pretty creepy, or the mobile topiary, which still works pretty well at making the hair on one’s neck and arms stand at attention. But King was using the haunted house trope to look at more personal demons. And those shine through more clearly now. From Allyn Scura’s blogHe had some drinking issues at the time he wrote the book, when he was 30, and concern about that is major here. Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, no question. He also has issues with anger management, not that the little shit he clocks while teaching at a New England prep school didn’t have it coming. He did. But one cannot do that to a student, however deserving, and expect to remain employed for long. His little boy, however, most certainly did not deserve a broken arm. Jack is very remorseful, and wants to make things right. He manages to get a gig taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter. It will offer him a chance to get something right after a string of getting things wrong, offer a chance to save his marriage, and offer an opportunity to work on his unfinished play. Risky? Sure. But a gamble worth taking. And his wife, Wendy, agrees, despite having serious misgivings. There are no attractive alternatives. Of course, we all know that the Overlook is not your typical residence. Odd things happen, sounds are heard, thoughts from somewhere outside find their way into your mind. Jack is targeted, and boy is he vulnerable.But five-year-old Danny is the real key here. He is the proud possessor of an unusual talent, the shining of the book’s title. Danny can not only do a bit of mind-reading, he can also see things that other people cannot. And for a little guy he has a huge talent. He also has an invisible friend named Tony with whom only he can communicate. It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran. By the way, the hotel is based on a real-world place, the Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado. And the Overlook’s spooky room 217 was inspired by the supposedly haunted room 217 at the Stanley. This image is from the hotel’s site – they clearly embrace the spectral connectionThe room number was changed in the film to 237, at the request of the Timberline hotel, which was used for exterior shots. There is so much that differentiates Kubrick’s film from the book that they are almost entirely different entities. The differences do require a bit of attention here. First, and foremost, the book of The Shining is about the disintegration of a family due to alcoholism and anger issues. How a child survives in a troubled family is key. The film is pretty much pure spook house, well-done spook house, but solely spook house, nonetheless, IMHO. There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time. You have to read the book to get that. Jack is a victim, as much as Wendy and Danny. You would never get that from the slobbering Jack of the film. The maze in the book was pretty cool, right? I liked it too, but it does not exist in the book. I believe it was put in to replace the talented topiary, which is the definition of a bad trade. There is significant violence in the book that never made its way into Kubrick’s film, but which very much raises a specter of domestic violence that is terrorizing real people living in real horror stories. There are a few lesser elements. Jack wielded a roque mallet, not an axe. Danny is not interrupted in his travels through the corridors by Arbus-like twin sisters. And the sisters in question are not even twins. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. An interesting film, for sure, but not really the most faithful interpretation of the book. King saw that a film that more closely reflected what he had written reached TV screens in 1997, with a six-hour mini-series version.Irrelevancies of a personal natureThe opening shot was filmed on the  Going–to-the-Sun Road in Montana’s Glacier National Park in Montana. I have had the pleasure (7 times in one visit) and recommend the drive wholeheartedly. It is a pretty narrow road though, so you will have to drive carefully. Bring along the appropriate musical media for the best effect, Wendy Carlos’s Rocky Mountain, and dress warmly. It was below freezing when I reached the top of the road, in August. Some exteriors for Kubrick’s film were shot at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon. I visited but did not stay there back in 2008. Sadly I do not have any decent personal photos from the place. I can report, though, on a bitThis shot was found on Wikimediaof kitsch. There is a place in the hotel where an ax is lodged in a block of wood, with HEEEEERE’s JOHNNY on the ax, a tourist photo-op. And yes, I did. Sadly, or luckily, the shot did not come out well, so you will be spared.Back to the book, Danny’s talent is a two-edged sword. He is afflicted with seeing more than anyone his age should have to see, but on the other hand, he has a tool he can use to try to save them all. Whether he can or not is a core tension element here. King is fond of placing his stories in literary context. He peppers the text with references to various relevant books and authors. I expect these are meant to let us know his influences. Horace Walpole, author of The Castle of Otranto, a Gothic classic, is mentioned, as is Shirley Jackson, of Hill House fame. King had used a quote from this book in Salem’s Lot. A family saga rich with death and destruction, Cashelmara is mentioned as are some more contemporary items, like The Walton Family, the idealized antithesis to the Torrance Family, Where the Wild Things Are and novelist Frank Norris. The primary literary reference here is Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death, which is cited many times. There had been a costume ball back in hotel’s history and it is the impending climax of that party, the unmasking, that looms here. And toss in nods to Treasure Island and Bluebeard for good measure.King often includes writers in his work, avatars for himself.  I write about writers because I know the territory. Also, you know it's a great job for a protagonist in a book. Without having to hold down a steady job, writers can have all sorts of adventures. Also, if they disappear, it's a long time before they are missed. Heh-heh-heh. – from an  AOL interview
Jack Torrance is a writer as well as a teacher. The play that Jack is writing undergoes a transformation that mirrors Jack’s own. In fact, there is a fair bit or mirroring going on here. Jack’s affection for his father as a kid was as strong as Danny's is for him. His father was an abusive alcoholic. While Jack is not (yet) the monster his father was, he is also an alcoholic with abusive tendencies.  I never had a father in the house. My mother raised my brother and I alone. I wasn’t using my own history, but I did tap into some of the anger you sometimes feel to the kids, where you say to yourself: I have really got to hold on to this because I’m the big person here, I’m the adult. One reason I wanted to use booze in the book is that booze has a tendency to fray that leash you have on your temper…For a lot of kids, Dad is the scary guy. It’s that whole thing where your mother says, ‘You just wait until your father comes home!” In The Shining, these people were snowbound in a hotel and Dad is always home! And Dad is fighting this thing with the bottle and he’s got a short temper anyway. I was kind of feeling my own way in that because I was a father of small children. And one of the things that shocked me about fatherhood was it was possible to get angry at your kids. (from the EW interview cited in Extra Stuff)He’s right. I have had the pleasure and I know. Wendy gets some attention as well, as we learn a bit about her mother, and see Wendy’s fear that she has inherited elements of her mother’s awfulness. Not everything shines here. There are times when five-year-old Danny seems much older than his tender years, even given his extraordinary circumstances. It struck me as surprising that there is no mention of anyone suggesting that maybe Jack might attend an AA meeting. But these are like single dead pixels on a large screen.If you want to read horror tales that are straight up scare’ems, there are plenty in the world. But if you appreciate horror that offers underlying emotional content, and I know you do, my special gift tells me that The Shining is a brilliant example of how a master illuminates the darkness.

I'm quite proud of a few of those reviews I've written before, so I will leave those up below if you're interested.Each time I reread this story, I pick up finer details and begin to care more and more deeply for this cast of fantastically-developed characters.This time around, I had recently watched the movie with my Book Club. That might sound strange to some, but we do quite a few Watch-Alongs. I hadn't watched the movie in years, and even though it's quite different, I've always had an appreciation for what it is.However, the act of rereading this shortly after that rewatch did help me to see a lot of the possible reasons why Stephen King may have hated the movie. I mean, it's common knowledge at this point that King wasn't happy with Kubrick's interpretation.The reasons I considered are too numerous to list, but I will say, this seems like it was probably a very personal story for King. When you look at the similarities between Jack's position in life and King's, they're quite similar. They're both writers, they both have addiction issues, they were both teachers when they probably wished they hadn't been, and they both had young families they were trying to support, while also trying to make it as an author; a difficult task. It's a lot of pressure for a young man in the 1970s.For example, Joe Hill, King's son, was born in 1972. The Shining was published in 1977, the year Joe turned 5-years old. Danny Torrance is 5-years old in The Shining.Kubrick, IMHO, did a horrendous job translating these characters, and the heart of this story, to the screen. Please understand, this doesn't detract at all from the amazing performances given by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duval, or Scatman Crothers; who were all amazing in the film.I'm sure they were all doing exactly as directed and man, did they pull it off. It's just vastly different from the book, and I feel like, if this was as personal a story for King as I am guessing, particularly in regards to Jack's character, he could have been, well, angry about it.For me, in the movie, Jack is in the role of villain. In the book, I don't see it that way. In the movie, Jack is constantly annoyed with Wendy, and frequently, even with Danny.Yet in the book, you can feel how much he loves them. It's something he struggles with as the powers of The Overlook begin to take hold. It's a back and forth, a real inner turmoil that he is under as a character. It's also a beautiful exploration of addiction, and through Jack, a complete journey of an addict.While that is touched upon in the film, I don't believe with the same care and grace that King gave it in the novel; perhaps due to his own journey through addiction. Maybe seeing Jack's character turned into such a horrible villain in the film, felt a bit like a personal attack to King, even if subconsciously.This is all speculation of course, just some thoughts I had reading it this time around. And yeah, this was my 5th-time reading it. It's one of my favorite books of all time and I'll definitely be reading it again!!Previously:This was my 4th-time reading The Shining.You read that correctly, the 4th-time. I'm aware rereading isn't for everyone, but I am a huge supporter and fan of rereading, especially tried and true favorites.I know a lot of people feel it is a waste of time, but for me, when a story is special enough to you, each time with it is like a whole new experience. That's exactly how I feel every time I open the pages of this book.Additionally, I feel like where I am at in my life plays a huge role in what I take out of a reading experience. For example, the first time I read this, I was in high school. You better believe that 14-year old Meg walked away from this having picked up on different things than 44-year old Meg does, reading it now.My experiences have shown me that rereading allows me to focus on different areas of any particular story. This time around, for me, I felt myself really drawn to the private thoughts and emotions of this cast of characters.Jack's experience, in particular, as he struggles with the position he finds himself in, his loitering addiction and the love for his family, hit me hard this time. Instead of seeing his horrible aspects front and center, I thought more about what was going on with him internally.There were moments of clarity for him, when he could see beyond the fog of the hotel's power, moments where he cherished his son and wife, but they would slip away like mist. It made my heart ache for the whole family.This experience also reiterated for me how much I love Wendy and Hallorann. They got played dirty in the movie adaptation and we all know it. Not by the actors, the acting was fantastic, but yeah, they feel like completely different people in the book, IMO.Again, I was beyond impressed with some of the scenes in this still having the ability to scare the shit out of me, even after all these years. The perfect example would be the first time Jack tries to trim the topiary.That freaking scene gets my pulse racing every time!I also felt like I paid more attention to the history of The Overlook this time through; like when Jack is looking into it. I really felt focused in those sections and loved being reminded of its intensely lurid history.Finally, I would just give all the stars in the universe, yet again, to King's sense of place with this one. His ability to transform a hotel into an actual character in the story is just a masterpiece. It's basically the standard to which I compare atmosphere in all other stories.I'm so glad I took the time to reread this. It was exactly what I needed to re-energize my reading. You better believe, this won't be the last time either!EarlierHere's the thing, July hasn't been the best reading month for me. I've had a lot of 2-to-3-star books. I'm frustrated. I'm getting disgruntled and burnt out on it honestly.I have never been in a reading slump before, but I definitely feel myself drifting into that territory...I feel like in an effort to keep that from happening, I am going to reread one of my top-3 favorite books of all-time. If anyone can shake me out of this funk, it's Jack Torrance.I hear the fourth times a charm!!!Original:Hi. Hello! It's me again, with another book you should consider picking up, if you haven't read it yet. The Shining is my second favorite book of all time.A true classic of Horror literature. I have read it a few times and it gets me EVERY. DAMN. TIME. This is one of the most atmospheric books I have ever read, with The Overlook Hotel, ultimately becoming a character in its own right. There are so many chilling moments from crazed topiary animals, to haunted elevators, and evil playground equipment. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it?Read it.Read it now!Meg's Advice: The Shining is best read on a cold, windy night, when you are home alone and there is the slight possibility that you may lose electricity. Candles burning are a must for this one!","i- i don't even know what to say that hasn't already been said about this but lemme give it a shot.god DAMN this is king at his best. i know, i know, ""kat that is so cliche. couldn't you have picked a less popular king book to stan?""i guess not, but hear me out.1. first of all, i love a good old fashioned haunted house story and that's exactly what this is. the slow progression of madness that overtook jack and the introduction of new ghosts (or hallucinations, whatever you decide) was INCREDIBLE. not to mention the thing that i think king writes best is the feeling of confinement, and what's more confining than being snowed into a haunted hotel that literally wants you dead?? oh right, nothing. 2. the characterization!!! ah! the way that king wrote these characters was just *chefs kiss* not only did i care about danny, wendy, and (sometimes) jack, but we also got to rip back the layers of their relationships with each other and dynamic as a family which i LOVE. even if you don't think this is a great horror story, don't deny it is a baller family drama.3. the horror of it all. whether you want to look at it as a family being attacked by ghosts, or a father being overcome by an extreme case of cabin fever, or even if the whole murdering thing doesn't scare you but you can see the fear that comes with having a family member who battles with some kind of addiction, this book is fucking scary. it may not have made me physically jump or scream, but i can tell you that it's a story that is gonna stick in my brain and not let go for a long long time (just like any good horror should)now for the obligatory comparison to the movie:it's common knowledge that king himself hates the Kubrick movie, but i love it. so much. it's one of the first horror movies i ever saw and i've seen it many times since, so while it's a popular opinion to love the book and shit on the movie i just can't bring myself to do it. yes, they're very different in a lot of ways, but honestly i think that Kubrick did the best with what he had to work with.a BIG part of the novel is rooted in internal conflict. we spend so much time inside of jack, danny, and wendy's heads that it would have been impossible (imo) to translate that to the screen without a near constant voiceover (like basically just the audiobook playing over all the scenes) sO, i can't fault the movie for what it lacks in depth of character and explanation...i just can't. however, if for some reason you're reading this and you have seen the movie but haven't read the book YOU BETTER READ THE FCKING BOOK ARE YOU JOKING?? READ IT.anyway, dear mr. stephen king, i'm sorry i ever said that your popular books were overhyped. some of them are *cough* IT *cough* but this one isn't.luv, katokay that's all read this book i don't have an outro okay byeeeee"
It,Stephen        King,4.24,"The most important things are the hardest things to say, because words diminish them...Some time ago the wise bald (or white) heads stationed at various universities came to an agreement that a literary form, commonly known as the novel, is dead - fewer and fewer works of any significance are written each year. Of course, one must understand the requirements the wise gentlemen expect of a novel of worth: it would be good if the writer would include some ""aesthetic dignity"" by including as much allusions and connections to other previous works of literature - consciously, that is. The language must also be exquisite; preferably obsure and as incomprehensible as possible, drawing from earlier works of worth and including metaphors and allusions to them. If the author by any chance happens to include a plot in his work, there is a good percentage of possibility that his work will be deemed unworthy, and forever excluded by the adacemia.Or at least as long as these wise gentlemen live.Of course, the reader is not expected to understand, not to mention enjoy the work of worth - no one reads anymore, the wise men would say; people read rubbish like Danielle Steel when Bold & Beautiful is not on the TV. And, by God, no such novel of worth can ever be popular - after all, the intelligence level required to appreciate it is apparently not met by the 90% of world population. A literary figure who is as popular and appreciated like The Beatles? Whose work is admired by thousands of people? And the possibility that these people might learn something from it? That is simply not possible - the wise heads mutter in unison - that is simply not possible! Ask people who know! Ask us!History, as we know it, has a nasty habit of repeating itself - though in this case something good might actually come out of it. Writers have been criticized before - most notably Twain and Dickens - and yet, their work is still read and loved by whole generations of readers. Their fiction is taught in schools. Huckleberry Finn has been deemed as vulgar and impropable, much od Dickens's work was described as overtly sentimental, but it prevailed - which can't be said about those who concerned themselved with being the so-called ""Arbiters of Literature"". In the end, they couldn't grind the knives because they weren't theirs to wield.The bones of those who tried to define ""literature"" perished; the works they so often tried to banish did not. No one remembers (or cares) about those who tried to defy the power of Twain or Dickens; they are immortal through their works.People perish; books do not. No one cares about the boy's club of the literati, who cry out words of rage from the ivory tower, instead of helping people understand the joy of reading, understanding and believing. The main principle of art is to evoke; the problem is, not many of the educated seem to understand that even simple things can evoke great emotions. But they too will go down in history without leaving any mark on it, forgotten and alone; and I believe that there will be a lot of bodies turning in their graves when some titles enter the school curriculum.""IT"" by all means, is not a simple novel. To classify it as a ""horror"" story is the same as saying that ""Moby Dick"" is a very long manual on whaling. To say that it is all about the monster is to say that the whale is the villain of the piece.We all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forestfires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up, for God’s sake. And you know why we were told that? Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic we knew made them ashamed and sad of what they’d allowed to wither in themselves.-Robert McCammonAlthough vulnerable and physically weak, two factors that make them perfect victims, children posess strenght that most adults had lost in the painful process of maturing - the strenght of imagination. A child feels and experiences emotions much more intensely than an adult, but their unique imaginative capacity allows it to cope with the seemingly impropable much more efficiently. Hence when in 'Salem's Lot an adult faces a vampire, he fells down dead from a heart attack. When a child faces one, he is able to go to sleep ten minutes later. As King puts it, ""Such is the difference between men and boys"".King has been depicting children throughout his whole career, and his child characters have subsequently grown older, along with his own children. ""IT"" is in my opinion his best novel with child protagonists; his most elaborate, complex one. It's also one of his longest, if not the longest. The lenght is appropriate, because of the theme: After all, it deals with childhood. Childhood defies Time; a day can last forever, and the summers are endless. And then we grow up, all these years pass, just like a blink.Kids are bent. They think around corners. But starting at roughly age eight, when childhood's second great era begins, the kinks begin to straighten out, one by one. The boundaries of thought and vision begin to close down to a tunnel as we gear up to get along.-Stephen King, Danse MacabreChildren also posess another one of the invaluable assets that most adults strive to grasp, and it still seeps through their fingers, like sand: Time. Children experience the passing of time differently not because time actually slows down for them (that would be a neat thing indeed) but because they occupy a vastly different social position than that of an average adult. Most adults are forced to work and take care of their families, offspring included. Their imagination is dimmed by the countless hours spent on labor, and for most it never really comes back...the disilusions of experience push it farther abd farther down in the dungeons of the mind, until we finally forget that it was even there in the first place.Until we forget what we are possible of...what adventures we can create, what worlds and realms, completely out of the whole cloth.When you are a child the hours lazily pass by, the only important matter is to get home from school and after throwing the backpack in a corner going to get your friends and hanging out with them till dinner...and then go hang out with them some more.The imagination is an eye, a marvelous third eye that floats free. As children, that eye sees with 20/20 clarity. As we grow older, its vision begins to dim . . . and one day the guy at the door lets you into the bar without asking to see any ID and that's it for you, Cholly; your hat is over the windmill. It's in your eyes. Something in your eyes. Check them out in the mirror and tell me if I'm wrong.The job of the fantasy writer, or the horror writer, is to bust the walls of that tunnel vision wide for a little while; to provide a single powerful spectacle for that third eye. The job of the fantasy-horror writer is to make you, for a little while, a child again.Most children experience more during one summer vacation than some adults throughout their whole life; They have their precious innocence, they haven't been spoiled by work, by taxes, by bills and other things that each of us has to face at some point in life. There is always food in the fridge, and there is always roof over the head; and if there is not, there is always hope that there eventually will be, and friends that help to keep it.Children do more and see more because they can; when school ends, the day is theirs. Their schedule is not as strict as that of an adult; their duties not as responsible. Therefore, they do not have to trouble themselves with money and shelter, and even if they do they are easily able to push these matters away and concentrate completely on what they are doing right here and now. With little breaks for homework and chores children can spend the whole day playing make-believe with their precious friends, and sometimes the boundaries between the real and the imagined become thin, and sometimes they vanish altogether. Sometimes their thoughts take shapes...and sometimes their fears do too. Sometimes they joy is almost tangible...and sometimes the boogeymen come out of the closet.And sometimes they are real.""IT"" is a story of a group of children who are not among the most popular, strongest or smartest; a tale about the group of seven friends living in Derry, Maine in 1958. They form the self-called ""losers"" club and encounter a horrible, awesome force lurking in their hometown...a force feeding on fear and devouring young children. A force that adults do not seem to see; a force that appears as a clown, holding a hand full of baloons.The seven children all have one thing in common: they encountered IT. They had all escaped...and that one summer of 58, the seven friends have confronted and defeated IT.Or so they had thought.28 years later a young homosexual is thrown off a bridge in Derry...it seems like a classic, clear case of homophobia, but the testimony of one of the witnesses changes everything.He claims he has seen a clown under the bridge...a clown and a cloud of balloons.Mike Hanlon, the sole member of the losers who remained in Derry calls the others and reminds them of the promise they had made all these years ago...a promise sealed in blood. A vow to return if IT wasn't dead. If IT will come back. And apparently, IT has.Can they face IT again? Can they go back to the horror they have long forgotten?They faced the terror as children. It was their time to take action, and they managed to fight it. Now they are all grown-up...but it is their time,too.Will the monster be bested...or will IT FEED?""IT"" is composed of two nonlinear narratives. The first is the story of 1958, where we meet the children and they first encounter IT; King effortlesly interleaves this timeline with the story of 1985, where the adults return to Derry to fight IT, basing on research that has been done on the subject and their returning memories. IT avoids the problems of most other lenghty books: plot threads that go nowhere. Each of them is important, and only adds to the suspense and builds up to the shattering climax.If there is a thing which places King above most other writers, it certainly is his great understandning of adolescence. Few others manage to write so vividly and convinclingly about childhood and coming of age.The unquestionably hard time of growing up - school, bullies, parents, first crushes - they are all here, and the reader feels as if he himself was experiencing them. King allowed me to re-live my past again; I wasn't around in 1958, but if I were I would undoubtedly be one of the boys. It is truly an impressive experience to read how King builds his characters and the world they live in.Which of course includes stormdrains...which might be empty, but then they might be not.IT also manages to adress important social topics: racism, prejudice, domestic abuse. But most importantly it is a story about friendship and childhood: How it irrevocably binds people together and affect their lives. About the power of memory and imagination; about the terror of the familiar world which hides many secrets around the corners and down in the sewers. It's a study of children facing the uncanny, and overcoming their greatest fear: the fear of being alone in fright.IT is a story of seven friends, each different, each indispensable and irreplaceable.stuttering Bill Denbrough, the unlikely group leader; Ben Hansocom, an overweight boy, with a talent for architecture;Riche Tozier, the brilliant witty boy of many voices;Mike Hanlon, the black kid who comes to the group to find acceptance and finds it;Eddie Kaspbrak, the asthmatic and fragile boy who finds within the group a thing he has never dreamed of - courage;Stan Uris, a sensible boy who brings understanding;and Beverly March, the sole girl in the group, an redhead who is both sweet and tough, and helps the boys in most dire of moments.King has proven himself earlier to be capable of producing an epic narrative (The Stand in 1978), but I think that IT is equal to - or even surpasses - the story of the plague.This is a brilliant novel, beautifully told in crisp, clear prose, with truly unforgettable characters and situations. It is the essence of good fiction; the truth inside the lie. King knows his way around the corners; and has that undefiniable look in the eye, the dreamy look of a child. His words are the best set of toys he ever had; and he's generous enough to share them with us. And when he's showing us how his trains travel along the tracks of his imagination and where they go to, we won't dare to blink because we could miss a minute of the experience...even when the carriage passes through some dark tunnels.And if it is the work of an ""inadequate writer"", a producer of ""penny dreadfuls"", without any ""aesthetic value"" or other high-flown pretentious gibberish babbled by people who would most likely want to cast Stephen King and his readers to hell for destroying the image of ""Literary Reader""?Like Huck Finn, I'd shout loud ""All right, then, I'll GO to hell!""Literary Heaven might have a better climate; but Literary Hell sure has better company.","”It wasn’t make-up the clown was wearing. Nor was the clown simply swaddled in a bunch of bandages. There were bandages, most of them around its neck and wrists, blowing back in the wind, but Ben could see the clown’s face clearly. It was deeply lined, the skin a parchment map of wrinkles, tattered cheeks, arid flesh. The skin of its forehead was split but bloodless. Dead lips grinned back from a maw in which teeth leaned like tombstones. Its gums were pitted and black. Ben could see no eyes, but something glittering far back in the charcoal pits of those puckered sockets, something like the cold jewels in the eyes of the Egyptian scarab beetles. And although the wind was the wrong way, it seemed to him that he could smell cinnamon and spice, rotting cerements treated with weird drugs, sand, blood so old it had dried to flecks and grains of rust…”

Once I turned the last page of 1,153 pages, I felt like Scribner or Stephen King or someone owed me a t-shirt saying...I survived IT. When I say IT, I’m not just referring to the enormous length of the novel, but also the total sticky, blood encrusted emersion in this epic tale of horror. The book is two novels entwined together. One is set in 1958 when seven children take on this alien creature, and the other is these same children, now adults, returning in 1985 to fight this entity again. A publisher with an eye for more book sales might have convinced a writer, a different writer than Stephen King, to pull these books apart and sell them in two separate novels, but I’m afraid we might have been talking about two three star books instead of one five star book. IT was meant to be.King manages to take these seven kids and make them into seven distinct personalities. After spending so much time with them, I feel like I know them better than friends I’ve had for decades. Even as King reintroduces us to them again as adults, we see the personalities of the children, like a hot stamped template, still in the adults. Mike is the only one who stays in Derry, Maine. He becomes the town librarian, and by default, the person who keeps an eye out for signs of the return of IT. The other six all leave and become very successful. Bill becomes a novelist and overcomes his childhood stutter. Beverly becomes a fashion designer, but still can’t shake her need to be with a man who hurts her. Ben loses all that weight he carried as a child and becomes a famous architect. Stan becomes a wealthy accountant. Richie is a disc jockey in LA. Eddie runs a successful limo service in New York. Mike speculates that IT has something to do with their career successes. But what exactly is IT?”Glamour, he said, was the Gaelic name for the creature which was haunting Derry; other races and other cultures other times had different words for it, but they all mean the same thing. The Plains Indians called it a manitou...These same Indians believe that the spirit of the manitou could sometimes enter them… The Himalayans called it a tallus or taelus, which meant an evil magic being that could read your mind and then assume the shape of the thing you were most afraid of. In Central Europe it had been called eylak, brother of the vurderlak, or vampire. In France it was le loup-garou, or skin-changer, a concept that had been crudely translated as the werewolf, but, Bill told them, le loup-garou could do anything, anything at all: a wolf, a hawk, a sheep, even a bug.” 

The glamour creature who haunts Derry prefers the image of Pennywise the Clown because it is primarily interested in attracting and attacking small children. The first victim we are introduced to, at the very beginning of the novel, is Bill’s younger brother George, who is pulled apart by IT while reaching for his paper boat which had fallen into the drain. Only Stephen King can begin a novel with such a horrific murder and keep readers glued to the pages. We have to know what the hell is going on? Our band of seven, or as they proclaim themselves The Losers Club, have watched plenty of horror films, so the things they fear have been manifested from the silver screen. Pennywise might morph into a mummy, Frankenstein, a large bird, a werewolf, a leper, a hideous spider, or a large crawling eyeball. Once one of the kids tells the others what he sees, they can see it, too. The creature must adhere to the rules of the game: if IT is a werewolf, for instance, then IT is susceptible to a silver bullet. Adults are incapable of seeing what the kids see. If blood spouts out of a sink and coats the walls and floor, only the kids know it is there. Once the “Losers” leave Derry to pursue their adult lives, they start to forget what happened. It is only when Mike calls them and asks them to come back in 1985 to stop the creature once again that they start to regain their memories. This time they won’t give up until this hideous evil is vanquished...forever. ”Got to become a child again, he thought incoherently. That’s the only way I can keep IT from driving me crazy. Got to become a kid again...got to stop it. Somehow.”

Sometimes we have to crawl back into our inner child to survive the onslaught of visual overstimulation that can crack an adult brain like a rotten walnut. A young elastic brain does better with a world gone mad. At the end of the final battle, Derry will never be the same, nor will this reader. I, too, hope some of my memories fade as I travel further away from the pages of IT. If you are a fan of the horror genre, you have to read this book. There is no time like the present with the new, highly acclaimed movie out in theaters. Read the book. Watch the movie. Mind wipe. Begin again.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten","UPDATE: $2.99 Kindle US today 9/21/21Listened to the audio this time and it was awesome The narrator is Steven Weber and he did a great job! Hello, welcome to Derry.. I'm Pennywise the Clown and at some point, especially if your a kid, I will eat your face off! Have a nice day!The first time I read this book was in the 6th grade and I had forgotten how good it was! I loved the movie as well, but the book is so much better! I love how Mr. King goes back and forth from when the friends were kids and to them as adults and what they do in life now, while they are on their way back to Derry. See, when they were young and all became friends, they made a pact that if ""IT"" ever came back so would they. IT showed itself to them in many different creeptastic ways but ""IT"" showed itself more as Pennywise the Clown! Bill's little brother Georgie was the first one to be.. um.. eaten... by Pennywise. I'm sorry, I don't care how old I am, if I saw a creepy clown down in a drain-gutter thingy (leave me alone, I forgot the name!) I would have ran until I fell over! I mean..no..no...no.. and NO! Bill, Eddie, Ben, Richie, Stan, Beverly, and Mike are all friends. I love each of their separate stories and I love their friendship together. They are all picked on by the town bully/jerk named Henry Bowers, but when they are together Henry can just go on down the road when the little group gets their courage and attacks Henry and his gang. I love the camaraderie between the friends and how they believe each others stories of meeting Pennywise, even when he wasn't in clown form. They didn't ridicule each other, they watched out for each other the best they could. At one point they think they kill ole Pennywise, but after many years and the killing of kids starts happening again, Mike, who stayed in Derry at the library, calls everyone home. It's weird how they all forget anything that ever happened to them until they get that phone call. It's like they were made to forget. And there is sweet Pennywise to welcome them back! Uggggg, clowns!!!!!!!!I know there are some people out there that hasn't read the book so I won't give out any spoilers for them, but one of the group commits suicide before anything even gets started and another of the group gets killed before they kill Pennywise for good.. or is IT really dead? I think Mr. King should bring him back with a whole new set of peeps that have to take him out :) Yes, I'm not quite right in the head! This is a very long book to read, but you know good books like this one really doesn't matter the length, when they are written very well, it just doesn't seem like a tome. Well, with the exception of holding the book up if you have joint issues, just let it rest quietly on your lap tray while you read :) I didn't get bored not one time in this book, I did, however want to shoot a few people and of course Pennywise... but I digress. At the end Mr. King wrote:This book was begun in Bangor, Maine, on September 9th, 1981, and completed in Bangor, Maine, on December 28th, 1985.That's a good amount of time and would explain how freaking good the book was in all of the detail. The detail was just awesome! I'm going to leave you with one last thing........THEY ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE.....MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
Dracula,"Bram Stoker, Rubén Toledo (Illustrations), Nina Auerbach (Editor) ...more",4.02,"Shockingly, not a whole hell of a lot of vampire stuff up in this bitch.Mostly, it read like a dull travelogue with lots of emotions.Bro love everywhere.All the men loved all the women (platonically or otherwise) to the point they were willing to give their lives for whichever lucky lady was Dracula's snack at the time.It was quite the love fest. Quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm buying that, Stoker.And Dracula?Not since Gary Olman's beehived old woman portrayal have I been less scared of this character.Welcome to my home. Allow me to get you some Entenmann's coffee cake whilst you peruse my garage sale knick-knack collection and trip over my cats...So, I've come to realize that very few of the classic characters or stories even remotely resemble what you think they will based on their modern counterparts. And in my uneducated opinion, most classics just aren't all that much fun to read. They're boring and filled up with tedious shit that I don't care about, and certainly don't want to read about. <-- Scenery, weather, random feelings about the scenery or weather, etc..I guess back in the day it was high fun to take walks, look at the landscape, and then go back home and write about it in your diary. And while I'm sure that sounds like heaven to some people who yearn for simpler times, the idea of reading about the nonsense of someone else's daily life makes me want to scratch my eyes out. Something I was surprised by, although in retrospect I shouldn't have been, was all the religious undertones in the story. Ok, yes. I knew Dracula was evil and couldn't be near crosses and whatnot, but I didn't think about this being a casually religious story about saving souls from damnation. Which, I mean, it's not like it was any fault of the vampires that they were dammed. At one time or another, they had all been humans who were targeted by another vampire as a snack. Vicious cycle and all that.And poor Lucy seemingly ended up a chew toy simply because she was a sleepwalker.Perhaps the moral of the story is that you need to make sure you aren't wandering around on moors at night so you don't get spotted by anemic monsters? Speaking of Lucy, did anyone else notice how incredibly fucking lucky she was that every single guy in their group was a compatible blood type for her? All those blood transfusions! None of them even remotely hygienic or safe. Forget supernatural demons who turn into bats - those transfusions were the scariest shit in this entire book.Brace yourself, because there are a lot of characters and POV switches. Again, most of what they were saying wasn't all that interesting, so it made me doubly happy that I decided to go with the audiobook version of Stoker's tale. And if I'm being 100% honest here, I probably zoned out a few times and daydreamed about when I needed to get the oil changed in my car or what we were having for dinner. But this is one of those books with a lot of superfluous information, so I don't think it hurt anything. I got the gist of it all okay without hanging on every word. Fair warning, the first half of this book is unbelievably dull. Mina writes in her diary about how she fretts over Jonathan's lack of letters from Transylvania & how hard it is to keep Lucy from wandering out the door at night, Lucy gets mysteriously ill & her fiancee gets worried, and the doctor dude (John Seward) moons over Lucy & watches one of his psychotic patients eat bugs. Renfield, being the only character in the book who doesn't want to talk about friendship & loyalty every five minutes, was by far my favorite. The second half of the book was only slightly more engaging to me, but at least there was a bit of urgency to it at that point. Van Helsing was on to Dracula, so garlic was being thrown over everything, stakes were being handed out like candy, and anything pertinent was being kept from Mina so as not to upset her delicate sensibilities. And then when that backfired spectacularly, they cut her into the loop and she was able to do an old-timey version of what a competent woman looked like. They even compared her brain to that of a man! <--I love these old books. Really.And what about Dracula?Well, he was sort of this shadow figure that lurked around the edges of the book. You never really meet him. I know, right?! What about the whole Vlad the Impaler thing? How he fixated on Johathan & Mina for some reason? Buzzz! Nope.Ok, get this: Dracula had been sort of like a special needs zombie who was finally learning stuff - like math...and how to employ minions to carry his dirt around for him. Apparently, up to this point, he had just been harassing his neighbors and nibbling on Romanian women. This whole thing with Lucy & Mina was supposed to be his bid at going global. Thank god for Van Helsing and his wacky foreign-man knowledge of urban legends.I guess one of the oddest things that I realized about this horror story was that when Lucy & Mina started turning toward the dark side, they got sexy. Yeah. Like, that was how you could tell they were creatures of the dammed. The men got all freaked out and weepy because their sweet, mild-mannered ladies lost their wholesome looks. They became 
wanton hussies
 with throaty voices and pouty lips. Holy shit, right? If that doesn't say something about how wackadoo things used to be, I don't know what will. Innocence or else!Anyway. This wasn't really a fun read but I'm glad I can finally say I've managed to put it behind me. Plus, it's one of those weird little windows into the past that reminds you things aren't as bad as they could be. I'd definitely recommend listening to the audio version with Tim Curry & Alan Cumming if you decide to go that route. The entire voice cast of this one really helped make it palatable for someone like myself who doesn't have the fortitude to read classics on their own.","I find Victorian horror so interesting as a microcosm of reaction to social norms of the time, to the buttoned-down and repressed social climate of the time, to the “new moral standards” of the church and the new questions brought up and hidden away by scientific thought. But under the fabric of late Victorian society lay wide ranges of change; the increased marriage rate and idea of the domestic sphere for women giving way to the New Woman, the upper class vs. lower class divide giving way to a new middle class. With the growth of the economy came new ideas of English excellence; with the growth of scientific thought, scientific racism. Literature, as is usual, struggles to react. With a growing counterculture in literature came the reaction to such; at the trial of author Oscar Wilde, passages from his only novel were read to prove that he liked men. Soon after, Bram Stoker, formerly his acquaintance, began writing Dracula. The result is a book drenched in fear of the unknown: In xenophobia of the time, in homophobia, and in the anxieties that come when that who embodies both appears. That is what sticks with me, to this day, about Dracula.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube","Two things about this book:1. It is a really great and creepy story that deserves classic status2. Everything is repeated soooooo much without any obvious benefit.Here is actual footage of Bram Stoker writing this novel:If Stoker had just got to the point, this book would have been much more exciting and suspenseful. I understand the exact same mysterious thing happens night after night. I understand that Dracula has some boxes of dirt. I get that you brought Winchester rifles along for protection. Each of these things was repeated ad nauseam throughout the book. Talk about killing the pace - by the time the gruesome scares came I was very disengaged. Also, funny thing about this book as a horror story - it must be the grandfather of heading up the stairs to hide instead of running outside or cutting through the graveyard shortly after hearing a serial killer is loose. They keep leaving people alone even though those people are repeatedly attacked when they are left alone. Then, when they finally insist on guarding someone, that person insists that they need no one but God to guard them!? Seems like so far God had not been interested in protecting, so why count on him starting now!?So three stars because it is a classic and I like the story. I especially like Lucy's suitors - their gung ho manliness amuses me. But the repetition and the illogical behavior in the face of a bloodsucking monster are the cause of the removal of a couple of stars."
Carrie,Stephen        King,3.99,"I want to start a shelf of ""books-that-traumatized-me-as-a-child-with-stories-of-girls-who-just-could-not-stop-gushing-blood-Down-There,"" but I can't think of any others besides this and Bell Jar. I know in Are You There God, It's Me Margaret they just couldn't stop TALKING about it, but I think that was different, more just perplexing and annoying than actually traumatic.Any suggestions?Um, BTW, this book is AMAZING. I should give it more than three stars. There! Done. Four! This is one of those books where you're just like, DUDE, how did you even come UP with these THOUGHTS? I mean, I think we take it all for granted now but honestly, this book is amazing. I mean, there's just so MUCH, from the scary religious fanatic mom to the pig's blood to the downed telephone wires to the..... I haven't read this in a hundred years, but I remember many scenes in it so vividly, and not just because of the movie (which is, of course, also great).I really think this took a lot of guts to write. I mean, the girls' locker room scene, come ON, I mean, who did he think he WAS when he WROTE that? I think he was still drinking then. He must have been. How much guts would that take, to be like, ""I'm this guy and I'm going to write this completely balls-out preposterous scene of what I imagine it could be like inside a high school girls' locker room, even though I obviously have NO IDEA. Oh, yeah, and this unpopular naked teenage girl's going to be in there getting her period for the first time, and it's going to be INSANE. Insanely bloody, that's what it's gonna be! Yeah, that's right, blood EVERYWHERE. It's a horror novel! I'm gonna start out with gore! What could possibly be more disgusting and disturbing than bleeding out of one's most private orifice? Well, I'm sure I have no idea what that's like, really can't imagine it, the whole idea sounds totally crazy to me, that such a gross thing would happen to anyone... but being inside a girls' locker room, wow, well that really sounds intense too. Though come to think of it, I have no idea what THAT would realistically be like either! So yeah, but I'm gonna write this scene anyway, gushing blood and mean naked high school girls and it's going to be COMPETELY @#*%ing CRAZY."" And he did. And it was.But it WORKED. This novel was insane and fearless and obviously written by someone who had this story in him that needed to gush out like Carrie's menstrual blood and crazy telekinetic angst. This is one of the books I think of when I get depressed about the idea of workshopped writing and the internal observing critic and all the rest of that limiting quality-control type stuff. Sometimes people need to tell the nasally fact-checkers in their fevered brains to sit down and shut up, and drown out the voices of reason and temperance so they can let the wild stuff come out, and when they do, that's when they write Carrie.Is this the Classic of Western Literature? No, not by most people's standards, and definitely not by mine. But it is a damn good story, and I'm glad he told it!","When people talk about bathroom scenes, there is always this psychobabble, but I prefer to remember this ode on teenage dirtbag cruelty with psi.I assume everyone knows the story, so there are unmarked spoilers in the spookhouse club. King loves outsiders, losers, and outlaws, so what could be better than to start one´s career with a meanwhile legendary pop cultural reference to serious puberty issues and female problems? So that the unwilling antagonist unleashed, but sadly not controlled and cultivated, dark elemental forces, to become for instance instead a classy dark fantasy black witch and thematized premenstrual syndrome. Sorry, I couldn´t withstand the bad pun, please don´t high voltage energize and burn me.  There is definitively symbolism I should have had more focus on when reading it the first time, but even without that, the idea of using menstruation as a plot device is something predestined for the master of horror. Probably there are cultures censoring this part, but leaving the slaughter in it. Blood out of piles of corpses good, sexual related blood bad style.  I guess everyone knows the story that it nearly wouldn´t have come to King´s career if his wife wouldn´t have found the manuscript, but there is something else about the development of this book I keep asking myself. Did he get this inspiration while working as a teacher, was a young lady who asked to go to the toilet or home because she had cramps the reason why one of the best authors of all time had his breakthrough? Is human reproduction to thank for that we got all these amazing works? The harshness and directness of this very young writing King is amazing, I remember so many details although there is close to no real action or plot until everyone gets a surprising finale event fun horror bloodbath. Religion and its potential negative side effects on the wellbeing, extraversion, and self confidence, not too speak of sex education, play a key role here too, because all of this couldn´t have been possible without a mixture of hardliner extremism and madness, resulting in poor Carrie having anger management problems that are not really reduced by the sociodynamics of hormone high high schoolers with horrible attitudes highlighted through the hilariousness of human culture and tradition. I don´t know why I h ed so much, sorry, maybe possession, especially strange because I am a bit too old for that and have the wrong gender, possibly and hopefully it´s a succubus after long, hard years of trying to invoke one or, why not, as many as possible.  It could have happened so much earlier if there wouldn´t have been this lack of virginity and already inherent madness problems that made me look less attractive to possess than an innocent, naive virgin, I have to keep an aesthetic, erotic, sadomasochistic, love hate , sick roleplay, memory picture for the next resurgence to wait and save myself up for the perfect monster girl and discipline my weak flesh to not faint in the face of other, cheap, worthless, earthy, fading, seduction. But finally, the self flagellation, animal sacrifices, and sexy female devil worship have made sense and I bravely sacrifice myself to help expanding their power.But whatever demon it might really be, if it´s true, beware many enemies mine. Everything is possible for a true believer in the dark forces. Mwahahaha Fun fact: It speaks for itself that the movie adaption of a tale about a victimized girl exaggerating self defense had the German title „Carrie Des Satans jüngste Tochter.“ Carrie, the youngest daughter of Satan. I find it extremely inappropriate that she has been discriminated and falsely accused of satanism, when her only real crime was killing a few hundred people. Shame on my native tongue!Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...","➳ 
 4/5 Stars 
Embarking on my first Stephen King adventure proved to be a journey filled with delight and intrigue. From the first page to the last, I found myself immersed in his masterful storytelling and drawn to the complexity of his characters. With each turn of the page, I felt a sense of anticipation, eager to unravel the mysteries woven within the narrative. It's clear that King's work comes highly recommended for a reason, and I'm eager to explore more of his literary treasures in the future.Carrie unfolds the gripping tale of a young girl who discovers her telekinetic powers amidst a chaotic upbringing and relentless bullying at school. As she grapples with the oppressive influence of her religiously dedicated mother and the cruelty of her peers, her journey culminates in a fateful showdown at the senior prom. With her unleashed abilities, Carrie seeks vengeance against those who have wronged her, leaving an indelible mark on all who cross her path.The narrative's authenticity is enhanced by the inclusion of various media excerpts, several articles and poignant quotes, lending a palpable realism to Carrie's story. It's these details that bring her world to life, making every page a compelling exploration of horror and its aftermath.°˖➴  ""Overall, it’s a compact novel, won’t take much of your time to breeze through. And if you've watched any of the Stephen king movie adaptations, don't hesitate. Just dive in. You'll be glad you did."" 🫶🏻-ˋˏ✄┈┈┈┈꒰🌷⊹ ࣪ pre-read review ᯓᡣ𐭩im soo freaking excited to dive into my first Stephen King book! Heard so much about his writing, hoping it lives up to the hype. Fingers crossed for a thrilling read! 😙🤞🏻"
Pet Sematary,Stephen        King,4.08,"""Cause what you buy, is what you own. And what you own... always comes home to you.""Louis Creed and his family have recently moved to the town of Ludlow, Maine. Behind their house there is a path that leads to a 'Pet Sematary', where the children of surrounding areas have buried their beloved pets in years gone by. Deeper in the woods there lies an ancient Indian burial ground, that Louis discovers has some sinister properties when their family cat dies...It's no secret that Pet Sematary is my favourite King book, but this is the case for a number of different reasons. When I first started reading horror I couldn't imagine words on a page actually scaring me, I always felt like I needed something visual to keep me up at night. Then I found Pet Sematary... I'd never had an experience before where I actually felt scared to turn the page - this was of course in the climax at the end of the novel. My heart was racing, my palms felt sweaty, I just kept thinking, ""There's no way this book is going to go THAT dark"" (clearly I didn't really know King yet!!). And then it did. And a King junkie and Constant Reader was born. IT was my first King, but Pet Sematary was where I became hooked.**NB Plenty of spoilers ahead**Now it's time to get personal... grief and loss has been a huge part of my life. When I was younger, my dad was diagnosed with MS, a debilitating disease that quite literally drained the life from him in front of our eyes. I guess this is similar in some ways to the Zelda and Rachel storyline, apart from the fact that my dad was never angry or resentful over his illness - or if he was, he never showed it in front of me. He progressively got more and more ill, over time losing his ability to speak, walk, eat. Death was ultimately a relief. But what about those who are left behind? It's strange because even though I was only 10 when he died, which is around 18 years ago, there are still days or times when the unrelenting grief can come out of nowhere and floor me. The loss of a parent is something you never get over, it is simply something you learn to live with. The only thing that can possibly be worse is the loss of a child. King's depiction of the grief and loss that both Louis and Rachel go through is so accurate it hurts. This book really resonated with me on a deep level, as I had never before read such a harrowing and realistic outlook on death and loss. There are so many passages that I've made a note of and will revisit over and over again.The way King crafted a book that is terrifying and heartbreaking in equal measures will never fail to astound me. Because this book IS terrifying - to lose someone is terrifying, to have to try to move on is terrifying, for them to come back ""different"" is also terrifying. Sometimes on instagram I will see people criticising Louis' decisions or making out that he's a bad parent and it makes me want to scream. Grief and loss does not allow for rational thinking. It does not allow for good judgement. It can be all encompassing to the point where you feel like you can't breathe. I defy anyone to tell me that if in a similar position you wouldn't even consider it (not forgetting the fact that there are other forces at work here). I know I would. Couple that with the overwhelming devastation and loss and your decision is pretty made. So to label Louis as a bad parent is absolutely ridiculous to me. Don't get me wrong, there was Ellie to consider, he still had that to live for, but in those heady initial days following such a heartbreaking loss, rational thinking ain't happening.It's a bit of a slow-build this book, but the pay-off is worth it. I enjoyed getting to know the Creeds, watching them form friendships with the Crandalls across the road. All the good stuff, you know, before shit hits the fan. And when shit hits the fan, it is almost too much to take. Gage's little Star Wars shoe in the middle of the road... the cap full of blood. Images that send chills down my spine. Then the unbearable dread as Louis digs up that coffin, not knowing what exactly he is going to be presented with. The way Louis initially thinks that Gage has no head as there is a dark moss covering his face... THIS IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES. The little figure appearing in Louis' room as he sleeps, the child's laughter that Jud can hear... Ellie having these vivid dreams and knowing that her family is in danger. This is really a masterclass in how to craft well-written, piss-your-pants horror. I bow to you, Sai King. Some of King's best writing in here and one of his best endings too. There's also some unforgettable characters in Louis Creed, Jud Crandall, Victor Pascow and Zelda. PUH-LEASE can I find a Jud Crandall that can act as a father figure to me?? The adaptation for this book is also pretty decent: Louis is a hot dad, Fred Gwynne was born to play the role of Jud, Zelda will trigger a cold sweat to run down your back...I could quite honestly write an entire thesis on Pet Sematary, so I'll end it here. All I'll say is this: if you didn't feel something when reading this book...... you need to check yourself *insert sassy emoji* Always my number 1 King book. 5 stars from me - obviously.Update: listened to audiobook in April/May 2018. Incredible narration by Michael C Hall. Still 5 stars. Obviously.Update 2: reread in March 2019 in anticipation of the new movie. Somehow loved it even more!!Update 3: reread October/November 2020. 5th read. Still my fave.Update 4: reread October/November 2021. 6th read.Update 5: reread October/November 2022. 7th read.","I absolutely LOVED rereading Pet Sematary. The experience filled my whole heart with nostalgic glee. King's masterful storytelling is on full display here. It's a perfect example of his style. If you have never read a King novel, this could be a good place for you to start.Classic King is definitely my comfort place; it's where I choose to live. This beloved story was somehow even more enjoyable the second time through!When Dr. Louis Creed decides to move his growing family from Chicago to Maine, he could never guess how much that one decision could impact their lives. Like another good 'doctor' before him, Victor Frankenstein, Louis is about to discover the hard way that...This is really such an incredible story. King's writing draws you in and holds onto you until the bitter end. As with many of his tales, there is an overriding feeling of dread and an ominous atmosphere that seeps through every page. It gets in your mind and stays there.The first time I read this, I was in high school. It was the early-90s and this was one of the scariest books I had ever read. I am in 40 now and this is still one of the scariest books I have ever read. In 1983, when this was originally published, I can imagine that it was heralded as a ground-breaking piece of horror fiction.In addition to still loving the characters, I picked up on a lot of details this time around that I don't recall noticing the first time. As an alumna of the University of Maine at Orono, where Dr. Creed takes a position as head of the student health center, I really enjoyed reading the small sections of the story that took place on campus.Side Note: The incident he describes with the fraternity boys who were brought in after crashing their toboggan gave me a good chuckle. My husband's fraternity was at the top of the hill facing the old steam plant. The one with the cannon replicas on it. We used to do all sorts of things on that hill including sledding, snowboarding and even 'slip-n-sliding' in the summer. Yes, injuries ensued. Another detail I picked up on this time around that I either didn't understand on the first go, or had simply forgotten, was all of the references to the legend of the 'wendigo'. When I was in high school I may have assumed this was something King made up instead of a reference to an actual mythical man-eating creature straight out of Algonquin folklore. You see, we didn't have Google at that time...And although I cringed during all scenes related to Church, he was treated so unfairly, I am so happy with this reread. I can definitely picture myself picking this up again and again for years to come. An definitive classic!","Wow. Just wow. I've put off reading this one for years because, well.... I'm a wimp. There, I said it. When one of the most well-known names in the contemporary era of the horror genre says something is his scariest book, I take note. It seems bizarre that I finally chose to tackle this one while having children the same age as Louis Creed's, it was precisely the perfect time to pick this up. I listened to almost the entire book over a 24-hour period while road-tripping, and the experience was unparalleled to any I've had in the scope of reading thus far. Side note, Michael C. Hall was the most excellent narrator for this. What likely was a 4 star read initially became a 5 star with no second thought. If you haven't experienced this version I cannot recommend it highly enough.Rather than a gory, blood and guts type of horror, this is a slow burning, queasy unease that explodes in the final chapters. The suspense nearly did kill me; by the final 25% I found myself wringing my hands and grinding my teeth, preparing myself for the inevitable that I knew was coming, deep down, ever since the beginning. I don't think I could have fully appreciated what King intended to accomplish with this novel if I'd read it before having children of my own. That's not to say that people without kids won't appreciate this as highly, just as statement in my own personal journey. Only King can accomplish so much horror with so little bloodshed. I finished this days ago but have held off on reviewing until now because I feel like I'm still processing and I can't stop thinking about everything that occurred to this family. I had spent so much time prior to reading this book in preparing myself for the big ""things"" that I was completely taken aback by how connected I became to the Creed family. This is why the detailed, slow burn; if I didn't care about this family, their neighbors, and the town in general, why would what happens at the end stick with me for the long haul? Oh sure, I would have gasped and guffawed at the disturbing nature of the plot, but I wouldn't have been emotionally invested. If you've been hiding under my big rock for the past few decades and are just catching up on your Stephen King backlog, like me, I highly recommend picking this up. It's not just about the scares with this one, but the contemplation on how grief can turn any of us into a monster. By far the best audible book I've chosen yet."
Frankenstein: The 1818 Text,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Charlotte Gordon (Introduction)",3.89,"3rd Review
- August 2022I read Frankenstein for a sixth time this week. Although it is one of my favourite novels, and in my opinion one of the finest pieces of fiction ever written, I find myself with a new appreciation of the text every time I come to it. A large proportion of one of my PhD chapters is about this novel. I'm discussing the idea of the vegetable diet along with purity and becoming our natural selves. And I'm also considering notions of animal rights, of the idea that man is very much an animal too and he has lost this sense of original self. Frankenstein at its very core is a novel about duality, of our capability to be both good and evil and to be both human and animal. There is so much to take from this book and there's so much that be taken apart, scrutinised and then put back together again. What's truly striking about the work is how much is reflects the anxieties of the age. It's full of insecurities about nature, god, science and our place in the world. Ultimately, it is a novel that creates a sense of unease because it highlights so much about the inauthentic nature of the lives many of us live. Running through the novel is a craving for freedom: a craving to to simply exist in a natural way. 
2nd Review
- January 2020Some books teach you something new each time you revisit them. I picked up the tragically wonderful Frankenstein for a fifth time this week, and I was totally mesmerised by the descriptive language used to describe the natural world. In all my previous readings, I focused on all the classic tropes of man and monster though I never considered the importance of the serene beauty that surrounds the story. The natural world dominates the background of the novel. It’s there, like a pervading monster that lingers in the darkest reaches of the mind. What struck me most about it was the fact that both Victor and his creation long for a real life, a life where one is truly alive. And they both ponder what this means at length, reaching the same conclusion: to go completely nomad. They both wish to live a life free of burden and complications, no money, no commitments and no responsibility. They just want to be totally free in the wilderness with the ultimate goal of finding happiness by looking after their most immediate and natural desires. And for me this says a great deal about society, not just the society in which this was written, but society in general: how many of us feel truly alive? 
Original Review
- 2016Let’s have a party Victor. Let’s get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let’s have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let’s go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn’t it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn’t have that party. Because if we did it would end in blood Yes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don’t wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you?“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...”Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein’s family. “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.”Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result. Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I’m not sure why, perhaps it’s the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings. My favourite quote:""This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you’re a silly, silly, man.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________","My apologies, but this review is going to be a bit frantic due to my brain being so oxygen-starved by the novel’s breath-stealing gorgeousness that I'm feeling a bit light-headed. So please forgive the random thoughts.First: Mary Shelley…I love you!!Second: Dear Hollywood - you lying dung pile of literature-savaging, no talent hacks…you got this all wrong. Please learn to read and get yourself a copy of the source material before you FUBAR it again. Third: My heart shattered for the “monster” and I haven’t felt this strong a desire to “hug it out, bitch” since reading Grendel and Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter. The “wretch” is so well drawn and powerfully portrayed that he form the emotional ligament for the entire story. He is among the finest creations the written form has to offer. Fourth:  As surprised as I am to be saying this, this novel has ousted Dracula as my all time favorite of the classic horror stories…sorry Bram, but the good/evil, sad, desperate loneliness of the orphaned monster trying to find a purpose and to define himself in the world trumps The Count. Five: 
No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
 As gorgeous as the prose is, I thought it a crime not to include at least one quote. Six: The “non-explanation” for the process that Victor uses to create the monster is thing of genius. No other approach could have possibly conveyed the majesty and significance of the achievement, because we would have known it was bullshit. Shelley did it perfectly…which leads me nicely into…Seven: The corny, slapdash lightning scene is entirely a work of Hollywood? There’s …NO…lightning…scene? Are you kidding me? Even Kenneth Branagh’s supposedly “true” adaptation had electric eels providing power to the “it’s alive” process. All of it bunk. I’ll say it again, Hollywood is a bunch of useless tools. . LIARS!!!Eight:  Speaking of tools, Victor Frankenstein is a giant one. As far as I am concerned, he is clearly the villain of the piece. However, what I found so squee-inducingly magical about Shelly’s writing was my degree of vacillation when it came to Victor’s character. I liked and even admired Victor in the beginning of the story and found his personal journey compelling. He was a genius driven by his desire to unlock the secrets of the universe and had that manic, “mad scientist” focus necessary to the accomplishment of such a lofty goal. However, once the “birth” of the monster came, I found myself waffling back and forth throughout the rest of the story. Ironically, his moment of success and his reaction to life he had conjured was when he began to lose his humanity in my eyes. His treatment of the monster was abhorrent. Despite this, Shelley was able to get me to see over my disgust and appreciate Frankenstein’s position and understand why he was so unwilling to continence the existence of “the wretch.” Not enough for me to forgive his lack of compassion, but enough for me to see him as a tragic figure. Huge propers for Shelley as that is excellent writing. Nine: I would place the monster among the finest literary creations of all time. This singular manifestation of humanity’s scientific brilliance and callous indifference to the consequences thereof is masterfully done. Frankenstein’s “wretch” became the prototype of the literary outcast and every “misunderstood” creature since has been offspring from his loins. His character profile is phenomenal, and just as Victor’s actions garner sporadic moments of understanding for his cruel treatment of the monster, so the monster’s wanton acts of vile cruelty severely test our compassion for him. Tested, bent and stretched, but, for me at least, never broken. I understood his pain…I understood his anger…I understood. Ten: No spoilers here, but the final resolution of the relationship between Victor and the child of his genius was…stellar. Everything was reconciled and nothing was resolved. The final reckoning occurs and it is both momentous and useless. Eleven: I expected the prose to be good but, having never read Shelley before, I was still surprised by how exceptional and ear-pleasing it was. Her writing really resonated with me and I loved her ability to weave emotion, plot momentum and a high literary quotient seamlessly together. Good, good stuff. Twelve: The novel is structured as an epistolary nesting doll using the frame story of Captain Walton corresponding with his sister about his expedition to the North Pole. While at the top of the world, Walton finds Victor Frankenstein stranded. This sets up the dovetail into Walton relaying Victor’s story which takes up the bulk of the novel and includes within it the incredibly poignant story of the “monster” in the creature’s own words. It is superbly executed and I thought the framing device was very effective. Thirteen: Despite my trashing of the movie versions earlier, there was one scene that I thought was handled far better on screen than in this story. Kenneth Branagh’s portrayal of  the murder of Elizabeth by the monster was far more chilling than Shelley’s more subdued recounting. I actually anticipated this segment being far more shocking and I was a tad let down as a result. This is probably my only gripe about the book.  Fourteen: On my list of all time favorite novels. The writing, the story, the characters, the emotion, the imagery, the power…all off the charts. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!P.S.(or Fifteen:) I listened to the audio version of this read by Simon Vance and his performance was extraordinary, especially his portrayal of the “monster.” Definitely check it out if you are a consumer of audio books.","So.I finished it.Warning:If you are a fan of classic literature and/or are utterly devoid of a sense of humor this review may not be for you.Also:Yes, I realize that I'm a moron with zero literary credibility. So, stop reading right now if the sound of an idiot whistling out of their asshole bothers you. Sure, you can comment below and tell me how stupid I am, but it probably won't make me a better person. Or will it...? I've always wondered what the real Frankenstein story was like...and now I know.Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality.And the reality is, this book is a big steaming pile of poo.It's an old-timey horror story, right?Not so much.I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunately, the only horror in the story centered around me having to keep turning the pages.Unless...? Beware mortal! You will DIE of boredom!Truly frightening.It starts like this:An upper-crust guy sails off to the Arctic to make discoveries, and to pass the time he writes to his sister. Supposedly, he's been sailing around on whaling ships for several years. And he's been proven an invaluable resource by other captains. So I'm assuming he's a pretty crusty ol' sailor at this point.Pay attention, because this is where Shelly proves that she knows nothing about men...So this guy goes on and on in these letters to his sister about how he wishes on every star that he could find a best friend at sea. After a few (too many) letters, they pull a half-frozen Frankensicle out of the water. Aaaaand here's what our salty sea dog has to say about the waterlogged mad scientist...""Blah, blah, blah...his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness...blah, blah, blah..."" Lustrous eyes?! No (straight) sailor ever, in the history of the world, EVER referred to another dude's eyes as lustrous. Ever. And I know what you're thinking.Well, Anne, maybe this character was gay. Didn't think about that, did you?! Actually, yes. Yes, I did. The only problem with that theory is that NONE of the male characters in this book sounded remotely male.Ladies, do you remember that time in your life (probably around middle or high school), when you thought that guys actually had the same sort of thought waves running through their heads that we do? You know, before you realized that they really don't  care about...well, all of the things that we do? You thought that while they were laughing at the booger their idiot friend just flicked across the room, something deeper was stirring in their mind. It just had to be!I'm not sure when it happens, but at some point, every woman finally realizes the (fairly obvious) truth.Men aren't women.That booger was the funniest thing ever, and nothing was stirring around in them other than maybe some gas.And that's ok.Fart-lighting and long distance loogie hawking contests aside, they can be pretty darn cool. But this author was too young to realize that.My personal opinion is that Mary was probably fairly sheltered and was used to running around with a bunch of artsy-fartsy dudes. Much like today, I would imagine these junior emos were probably blowing poetic smoke up her young ass in the high hopes of getting into her pants.Although it's possible I'm totally misreading the situation.Anyway, Frank tells his story, and Sea Dog writes it all down for his sister.In excruciating detail.Rivers, flowers, rocks, mountain tops...agonizingly cataloged. And the weather? God forbid a breeze blows through the story without at least a paragraph devoted to the way it felt on his skin or affected his mood!And speaking of Frankenstein's mood.I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of reading about a character this spineless before. He didn't talk so much as he whined.And the swooning!He was like one of those freaking fainting goats!I can't even count how many times he blacked out and fell over. Of course, then he would get feverish and need ""a period of convalescence"" to recover.Again, every episode was recounted with incredible attention to detail.I'm thrilled that I never had to miss a moment of his sweaty brow getting daubed with water! Randomly Inserted Fun Fact: The monster quoted Milton in Paradise Lost.Shockingly, I only know this because it was in the appendix, and not because I have any real-life experience with reading that one. Was this the most painfully unnecessary book I've read this year?Yes.Is there a deeper moral to this story?Yes.Some would say, that the monster is a product of a society that refuses to accept someone who is different. Or maybe that Victor Frankenstein was the real monster for not realizing that he had a duty to parent and care for his creation? Perhaps it is meant to point out our obsession with perfection, and our willingness to disregard people who don't meet the standards of beauty as non-human?Some might say any of those things.
I,
 however, learned a far different lesson from Frankenstein.And it's this...Trust no one.Not even someone who (just an example) has been your Best Friend for decades!Let's read a classic, Anne. It'll be fun, Anne. We can call each other with updates, Anne. It'll be just like a book club, Anne. Tee-hee!Liar, liar! Pants on fire!I read this whole God-awful book, and you quit after 10 pages! I'm telling your mom!Anyway.Here's the quote that sums up my experience with Frankenstein:""Blah, blah, blah...in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure."""
’Salem’s Lot,Stephen        King,4.10,"4.5 starsI feel like there has been a lot of debate over Stephen King's last few books about what genre he might be considered anymore. Mystery, sci-fi, fantasy, general fiction, etc. etc. etc. - you just don't hear Stephen King = horror all that much anymore. Well, if you want to get back to the roots, Salem's Lot is pure, raw, old school Stephen King horror at its finest!I am doing a re-read of most of Stephen King's books chronologically and Salem's Lot was the next after Carrie. I read it originally sometime back in the 90s. I am so glad I did because, honestly, I don't remember any of it! Salem's Lot is a vampire story influenced by vampire fiction, like Stoker's Dracula, as well as vampire horror flicks. The influence of both these mediums is very evident, while at the same time King crafts a new, unique, and terrifying vampire story of his own. If you are a fan of the original, raw, pure evil vampire (not ones that sparkle), you need to make sure and read this book!Those of you out there who have heard about King, haven't read him before, and are wondering where to start, this would be a great place to do so! I think many would agree that this is up there with King's horror fiction at its best.",Jahoobies...iykyk,"2023 reread:And so I reread it again — thank you, Fiona, for a wonderful buddy read! — and this time it’s like I was transported back to being young and discovering this book for the first time. I loved it again.This time I was really taken by King’s ability to paint the setting. His prose is excellent, and the way he brings the small town with all its secrets to life is almost unparalleled. He just has this way with words, zeroing right on to the defining qualities of people and places. Even a very young King understood the darkness of people and small isolated places. Because there’s not too much of a supernatural push is even required to unleash the inner monsters of people; the inner low level of nastiness in the ordinary folks can only be outweighed by the inner decency of the others.“The Lot” chapters are what those looking for “a great American novel” need to read. 4.5 stars.—————2022 reread through older eyes:In my teens and early 20s I inhaled King’s books. He was THE writer, to the point when I actually disappointed my university literature professor who would have liked if I had preferred Dostoyevsky instead. And as I got older, King’s books mostly held up, and some even gained extra appreciation (ahem, Needful Things, you got better as you got older).‘Salem’s Lot is a very young King, apparently started when he was 25, and it shows. It’s still good though, and is full of all that I like in King’s stories as even back then he was first and foremost a gifted storyteller: the creepy vibe of small towns and their inhabitants, and nastiness that lives inside regular people even before any actual “big” evil comes into their lives. And if there’s a hint of immaturity there — well, duh, the guy wasn’t born 75. I was still fascinated by his signature meanderings that tell stories within stories, and the gradual ratcheting up of tension that’s better than any pay-off there can be. 3.5-4 stars on reread which I’m rounding up because, well, whaddya want from Constant Reader of Uncle Stevie’s yarns here?————————Review from circa 2014 based on a few feverish reads of this book back in my teens: There was a time once when vampires were ruthless predators and not the misunderstood brooding and essentially harmless creatures. Ahhhh, good old scary times... Vampire stories have been around for a long time - after all, people love a good scare, and what is more terrifying than a monster showing up at night and sucking the life essence out of you? But leave it to Stephen King to turn the terror up a notch, add a whole new layer to it. How? Simply - using the winning formula that he continues to employ in the vast majority of his work. In addition to showing us the monsters of the night, he also brings into the picture the monsters and the darkness that are already with us, that live in the deep dark recesses of everyone's soul. """"The town knew about darkness.""""The town has its secrets, and keeps them well.""""The town cares for devil's work no more than it cares for God's or man's. It knew darkness. And darkness was enough.""The eponymous 'Salem's Lot is a small town in Maine, and it is not a stranger to secrets and darkness. It's quaint and pastoral on the surface, but once you look deeper you are bound to discover what lurks behind its respectable surface. And trust me, that's the discoveries that you can easily go without for the darkness of the human soul as presented by Stephen King beats everything that any monster or boogeyman can ever send your way. The small town of 'Salem's Lot can boast your usual lies, bullying, corruption, and prejudice - and spices it up with well-hidden child abuse, violence, and murders. Not so quaint, is it? It is this portrayal of everyday people's secrets, of the towns being almost like living breathing organisms that is one of the big reasons why I am a huge fan of Stephen King's works.From the very first pages of the novel we know that some terrible fate made 'Salem's Lot a ghost town with apparently only a couple of survivors. It doesn't take the reader long to realize, as we go back in time to see how the events unfolded, that the mysterious menacing Marsten House welcomed new evil that tends to lurk at night, floating past your (hopefully, tightly shut) windows. The story itself is rather straightforward, steadily moving along to its almost-conclusion that we have glimpsed in the first few pages, and we watch with bated breath as our bunch of good guys - Ben, Mark, Susan, Matt - are trying to take on the supernatural horror. Oh, and did I forget Father Callahan? A high-five from the Dark Tower universe, Father!King is excellent with the plotting and the pacing (since this was only his second novel, he was still a stranger to writing larger-than-life brick-sized tomes). The story never lags, the suspense and sense of foreboding are rampant, and there are quite a few truly nailbiting situations. Nothing distracts the reader from the vampire story unfolding on the background of small-town horrors. There are no heavy-handed lessons to be learned, no deep morals to take out of the story - all we get is a thrilling and quite scary ride that may make you (a) sleep with a light on, and (b) be very careful about who you invite into your home.——————Also posted on my blog."
Misery,Stephen        King,4.23,"'Misery' is a gruesome story of torture with blood, guts, and a psychopath. It's a well told tale, the characters are well developed and the fact that there are only two of them never gets boring. It's a real page turner, in fact I finished it tonight after getting off the subway on the platform before I walked home. But, this book is more than just a thriller, just like King is more than just a pulp writer.I read an article by the ever optimistic and cheerful Harold Bloom in college about how dismayed he was that young people like Stephen King so much. All the literature crtics I've read hate King and it seems like it's just because people actually enjoy reading his work. Yeah, Bloom, I said 'work' just like I would about Tolstoy's 'work' because Stephen King as damned hard worker. Think of all the books he's churned out over the last few decades. I'd like to see Harold Bloom show enough imagination to write fiction instead of just criticizing it all the time.I'm actually new to Stephen King's fiction. I've read a few of the essays and articles he's written and a really great graduation speech he gave at UMaine awhile ago in which he extolled the virtues of our mutual home state, but this is only my 3rd novel by him. I like this guy, and I know why too. It's not just because he makes me scream and I have a hard time putting his books down, it's because King loves writing. He has a real and self-aware relationship with what it means to be a writer. He knows he's not Tolstoy or Faulkner, he doesn't try to write that way. He knows how to tell a good god damned story and he has a passion for it. I appreciate his self awareness as a writer and the fact that he ackowledges how difficult the whole process is while not making us feel like he's somehow superior because he's figured out how to do it.In 'Misery' it's almost like we get to watch King write this story. He doesn't just set us up for a crazy story and watch us discover things about his characters, it feels like he actually comes with us and makes the discoveries at the same time we do. That's what makes a good storyteller. And I don't give a damn if Bloom likes him or not.",man sure does like his words,"Honestly, who among us hasn’t gotten frustrated with their favorite writer and felt like holding them prisoner while forcing them to write the exact book that we want?Well, don’t do that because it would be wrong! What kind of twisted freaks are you people?!?Paul Sheldon is a best selling author who just ended his popular series of romance/adventure novels by killing off the lead character, Misery Chastain. After finishing a new novel at a Colorado resort Paul has a car accident and awakes to find that his legs have been shattered, but that he’s been saved by his self-proclaimed number one fan, Annie Wilkes. Unfortunately, Annie turns out to be more than just a little crazy, and when she learns that Paul killed Misery in the latest book she demands that he write a new one that brings back her favorite character. Held captive by a madwoman, Paul is almost helpless to resist the physical and psychological tortures she uses to get her way while insisting that it’s really for his own good.This book seems eerily prophetic of King’s career in some ways. Uncle Stevie hadn’t yet frustrated readers of his Dark Tower series with long delays between books, and yet he absolutely nailed the self-righteous fury of a fan who feels somehow cheated out of what they deserve. You gotta think that later on King worried that he had some version of Annie out there just waiting to chain him to typewriter to finish DT. He was also years away from suffering his own enormous physical trauma after being hit by a car, but he still makes you feel every agonizing moment that Paul suffers from his accident and at Annie’s hands. Like Paul, King would also have the experience of returning to writing being a matter of overcoming physical pain but also finding it to be a way to escape it.One of King’s biggest strengths is that he knows the power of a good story, and this plot serves him well by really letting him dig into that. Annie’s obsession with Misery is something that probably almost every reader can relate to, but what’s really interesting is how Paul’s need to tell the story becomes just as compelling as Annie’s threats. The set-up lets Uncle Stevie explore the whole notion of just why we gotta know what happens next as well as the rules that make it a satisfying resolution or a cheat.I could make a pretty solid argument that this is King’s best book. He was very much at the peak of his powers here, and either the simple two person structure of the story or good editing kept this at a normal novel length. That’d become a rarity in his bloated books after this, and it does feel like King at his most disciplined. In Annie Wilkes he crafted a character worthy of being included in a Villain’s Hall of Fame, and he makes good use of her as a figure who can be terrifying, sometimes tragic, and weirdly humorous at times. However, I’m not saying it’s my favorite King book. (Probably The Stand or the last Dark Tower hold that honor.) Why wouldn’t his best book be the one I enjoy most? Because he did just too good of job on making us feel Paul’s pain. Sure, this is a book about a man who suffered a terrible accident and then found himself brutalized at the hands of a psychopath so it makes perfect sense that Uncle Stevie would want us to ache along with Paul. Yet, it’s very hard to spend an entire book with a main character who is almost always at some level of agony without feeling worn down by it. It’s necessary for the plot, but it also makes it a slog at times.So it's definitely among King’s best, but it's also one I haven’t read it nearly as many times as some of his others because it’s simply too damn tough to get through at times. Still it’s a 5 star ride if you grit your teeth and keep reading as Paul keeps on writing."
The Stand,"Stephen        King, Grover Gardner (Narrator)",4.35,"As soon as Chinese New Year got cancelled, I knew coronavirus was serious. Then the virus spread just like viruses do in every horror novel. So much so, in fact, that my immediate first thought was not to stock up on bottled water and toilet paper, but that it's finally time to read 
The Stand.
Naturally I'm a Stephen King superfan, so it's strange I hadn't yet read what is commonly considered his magnum opus. In the back of my mind I knew there would be a right time to read it. I thought it might be after King's death (rue the day) or after reading everything else by him. As a way to fully compare it to the rest of his oeuvre. Clearly, however, a once-in-a-100-years pandemic was the sign I was looking for. This is it, folks. It's time.As it turned out...maybe not the best idea. After seven months of living through this, there's a level of new normalcy. But in those early days, during constant uncertainty, seeing nearly 4,000 Americans die daily, entire nursing homes wiped out, entire families...it was scary as hell. Reading a scary book during a scary time isn't nearly as fun as it sounds.I kept a reading journal throughout this time. Partly because I wanted to remember my reactions throughout such an enormous read, but also to monitor my mental state during a pandemic. Much of my journal entries relate to bad dreams, reactions to the news, or just keeping up with the death count. Many times Stephen King's world was a close parallel to the real world, resulting in much anxiety and much admiration for a writer capable of prophecy.Here's the full, unabridged copy of my The Stand review journal:01/27/2020 - What better time to see what The Stand is all about than during a global coronavirus pandemic? Given this book's epic length, I’m going to do a review journal with spoiler-free reactions over the many months I suspect it will take me to finish.Three chapters in, and of course I’m hooked. Would expect nothing less from King. It may be a big ass book, but he doesn’t wait around to get started. For this rollercoaster, you skip the line and sit right up front. Clickity-clank, clickity-clank, then a straight drop. If the rest of the ride is this intense, and the coronavirus doesn’t kill me first, I’m going to be one frazzled mess by the end.02/11/2020 - I've been reading this a while, but only at 10%. My main thought right now is that it's entirely unfair for Stephen King, probably writing most of this while still in his 20s, to be this good. Old characters, female characters, rich, poor--they all come across so real it's startling. How can one mind comprehend so much? How does he articulate it so well? He builds this terrifying world one person at a time and it's so much scarier that way. I'm in awe.In other news, over 1,000 deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus. That's approximately 2-3% death rate for those infected. Better than the 99% death rate in The Stand, so there's a bright side. Of course, there are Internet rumors circulating that China is under-reporting and the real count is significantly higher.02/28/2020 - Up to 15%. Starting to question my logic that reading this during a pandemic will make it more fun. I became physically disturbed last night while reading in bed. Like, on the brink of a panic attack. It's all getting too real. The careful pacing particularly. Stephen King, prophet that he is, describes our current world too well. One case spreads to ten, to fifty, to a thousand. The government doing all it can to prevent blame, to avoid panic. Of course that's making it worse.For historical reference, what's going on right now is that there are more coronavirus cases outside of ground zero China than in. Last I heard that includes 56 countries, with rates rising every day. Other than China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan seem to have it the worst. The W.H.O. just raised its risk assessment from ""high"" to ""very high,"" which is their most extreme rating outside of declaring an outright pandemic. Saying the world is under pandemic essentially succumbs to the realization that the virus is unstoppable and everyone on the planet will eventually be exposed.The death rate for the coronavirus is somewhere between 2-3%. I calculate that 2% of the world population is 154 million.There's also been a case where someone previously ""cured"" of the coronavirus caught it a second time.At home, our president has censored the CDC from making any announcements about the virus without approval by the vice president. When asked why the stock market is tanking, he blamed the recent Democratic debate.Still unclear which is scarier right now, Stephen King's novel or reality.03/03/2020 - have to share this frightening quote from the book before I forget:The President is scheduled to speak tonight at 6:00 PST and his press secretary, Hubert Ross, has branded reports that the President will speak from a set mocked up to look like the Oval Office but actually deep in the White House bunker “hysterical, vicious, and totally unfounded.” Advanced copies of the President’s speech indicate that he will “spank” the American people for overreacting, and compare the current panic to that which followed Orson Welles’s “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast in the early 30s.03/13/2020 - It's a misty Friday the 13th. I'm reading The Stand on my break, which happens to be at home now. The office is still open, but we've been instructed to work from home for the unforeseeable future. This doesn't come as a surprise since nearly all gatherings have been cancelled. Talk shows are without an audience, theme parks are closed, movie releases are all delayed. The upcoming presidential debate has been relocated to avoid cross-country travel. Entire countries are on lockdown.It's all playing out eerily similar to Stephen King's doomsday scenario. The book, so far, has been a crystal ball for what happens next. Within hours of reading a passage where King's president delivers a cough-filled address stating that virus concerns are blown out of proportion and a vaccine will be delivered next week, Mr. Trump appears in the oval office and assures all Americans will have access to testing and free medical treatment. Surprise, surprise, both presidents lied.What's still to be determined is just how deadly this virus is. On one hand you have 22 dead in a single Seattle nursing home, but on the other it's been suggested that hundreds of thousands of infected people are running around who don't even know it because they don't have symptoms or they aren't serious. It seems like either way I'm not personally at high risk, but I am worried about those who are.These are certainly interesting times, to say the least.03/19/2020 - Today marks my first full week of not leaving the house. There's little incentive to at this point. Movie theaters, restaurants, and book stores are all closed. And even if they weren't, the risk of getting COVID-19 isn't worth the reward. Fortunately we saw this coming and our house is stocked with food, water and other essentials. I'm thinking we can last another two weeks before needing to venture out again.Being honest, I've struggled to pick up The Stand as of late. King usually delivers a delicious dose of escapism disaster, but under the circumstances it's all hitting too close to home. Like reading Cujo while living with a rabid dog.I also think the last few chapters have been really boring, though. I'm at 26%, which probably translates to page 350ish, and the most recent characters have really snoozed the action. I know I still have a bazillion pages to go so I'll hold off before giving final judgement, but in this present state I wouldn't call it his best work. Of course this wouldn't be the first time that a King book had a lengthy lull before launching back into life-changing thrills.We'll see how I feel after another week. Hopefully I'll have better things to say about The Stand, and will not have yet descended into madness.03/28/2020 - The Stand did get good again. I’m at 35%. Been reading faster than normal because I have this conspiracy in my head that the coronavirus will finally end the day I finish reading this book. Unfortunately, even at my current pace, that might be several more months. I’m trying, world, I’m trying! LolAs for current affairs, today is sadly noteworthy because over 2,000 people have officially died from COVID-19 in the United States. Just two days ago we hit 1,000 dead. The way things are going, it’s very realistic for those numbers to continue doubling every few days.The virus itself is still somewhat mysterious. Is it airborne? Kinda yes, kinda no. How long can it stay on surfaces? Several days...ish. Can you get it from touching cardboard boxes? Maybe? Will warmer weather do any good? Don’t count on it. Who can you trust? No one, of course, because even the seemingly-healthy can spread it all around.The president expects everything to be fixed in a few weeks so churches can be packed on Easter Sunday. We’d all get a good laugh out of a comment like that, except the situation is too dire.What else has been going on? So much I can’t even keep track. The government somehow came up with $2,000,000,000,000+ to infuse the economy, save businesses and give people enough money to hopefully keep the lights on. Pretty cool, I guess, but I think we’re all wondering what will happen next if this goes on for several more months.A number of celebrities and politicians have caught the virus, some have died from it. A grim reminder that this really does impact everyone. You can’t buy your way out of this mess.04/16/2020 - Future me, whenever you decide to re-read The Stand (which I’m sure you will at some point) remember that the end of “Book 1” gets boring. But don’t give up, because the adventure really starts with “Book 2.” There’s a lot of direct homage to The Wizard of Oz, like there is in The Dark Tower series. Slightly cheesy, I suppose, but Oz is up there among the great quest novels so it’s worthy. And like Oz, King populates his journey with unexpected characters who become close to your heart. You’ll fear for them, and really hope they don’t die—even though in the back of your mind you suspect they will.Hopefully you won’t live to see another global pandemic, but if you do—don’t read The Stand during it. You will be tempted, because it is perhaps the definitive literary achievement of pandemic stories, but it won’t make you feel better. It will make you feel worse.If it’s been 19 days since you last updated your review/blog, remember that looking back at what’s happened in the world will be depressing. For example, 19 days ago only 1,000 Americans were documented as succumbing to the virus. Now that number is 34,000 and growing rapidly. Globally, there’s been 144,341 deaths. These numbers include only those who were officially counted, of course. The world is unfair, and you know that there are many more who society didn’t deem important enough to be included in the statistics.One good thing about revisiting The Stand will be recognizing that no matter how horrible your current political situations are, remember that most political situations are horrible. In the 1970s, King imagined a president who refused to take any responsibility for the handling of a pandemic. Had King’s president lived long enough for the other branches of government to approve stimulus checks, there’s no doubt he would have demanded that those checks bear his name. Situations change, but people generally don’t.If you are absolutely determined to re-read The Stand during another pandemic, remember that it’s okay to take a break and read other books before coming back to it. I recommend gothic romances. They're a good melodramatic distraction from all the real drama swirling around.05/06/2020 - What’s life like during a pandemic? I suppose people will ask years from now. For me, at least, the staying at home part isn’t bad. Where there’s books and Internet, I’m good. I’m still employed (from home) and taking online classes, so too busy to let staying in every night be oppressive.That said, I still find myself suddenly panic-stricken. The smallest thing sends me a spiraling. Planning a birthday party and realizing it’s impossible amid a swirl of uncertainty. Will I still have a job in six months? Will it be safe to travel? Will the next wave of virus be even worse? Will I be dead by then—what about my family?Other things too. Watching a movie where people happily interact can be an escape, or a grim reminder that those moments were the before times—times we may never see again.Are my panic attacks unwarranted? Probably. Mostly. But how can I be sure?Even if we do eventually return to normal, what’s the long-term psychological impact? Can I ever attend a concert or visit an amusement park without imagining a plague of death in the air?The new developments haven’t been reassuring. It’s not just flu-like symptoms; the virus causes blood clots which can lead to fatal strokes. The strain that’s out now is more severe than the original strain. Maybe you get it once and you have antibodies, maybe you can get it an unlimited number of times. The official death toll continues to rise to terrifying numbers, but they’re also saying the virus could have gone global as early as December 2019. How many COVID deaths haven't been counted? Hundreds? Thousands?By the way, says some government leaders, we believe this virus was manufactured in a Chinese lab. Great. What does that mean? Was China reckless? Was this intentional and we have a nuclear war to look forward to?Oh, and murder hornets.Ugh!Anyway, back to The Stand. I’ll admit to still reading slowly. It’s good. Really good. But I can only handle small doses at a time. King is revving up to create the ultimate Good vs. Evil battle. Stakes of Biblical proportions. I still got about 500 pages to read, but I can see why people find that aspect of it appealing. I’m not convinced it’s Top 5 King material yet, but I’m willing to let the adventure roll on and be convinced otherwise.06/04/2020 - Dreams play an important role in The Stand. Survivors of the super flu dream both of holy Mother Abigail and evil Randall Flagg, but where their sympathies lie determines their allegiance.Since the beginning of the pandemic I’ve had my own reoccurring nightmares.

.***","You know what’s really scary? Getting sick while you’re reading the first part of The Stand. Just try running a fever, going through a box of tissues and guzzling the better part of a bottle of NyQuil while Stephen King describes the grisly deaths of almost every one on Earth from a superflu. On top of feeling like crap, you'll be terrified. Bonus!After a bio-engineered virus that acts like a revved up cold escapes from a U.S. government lab, it takes only weeks for almost all of humanity to succumb to the disease. A handful of survivors are mysteriously immune and begin having strange dreams, some of which are about a very old woman called Mother Abigail asking them to come see her. More disturbing are nightmares about a mysterious figure named Randall Flagg also known as the Dark Man or the Walkin’ Dude.As they make their way through an America almost entirely devoid of people, the survivors begin to unite and realize that the flu was just the beginning of their problems. While some are drawn to the saintly Mother Abigail in Boulder Colorado who tells them that they have been chosen by God, others have flocked to Flagg in Las Vegas who is determined to annihilate all those who refuse to pledge their allegiance to him.If King would have just written a book about a world destroyed by plague and a small number of people struggling in the aftermath, it probably would have been a compelling story. What sets this one apart is the supernatural element. Flagg is the embodiment of evil and chaos. He's a mysterious figure who has been giving the wrong people the push needed for them to make things worse for everyone, and he sees the plague as his chance to fulfill his own destiny as a wrecker of humanity. And on the other side, we have God. Yep, that God. The Big Cheese himself. But this isn’t some kindly figure in a white robe with a white beard or George Burns or Morgan Freeman. This is the Old Testament God who demands obedience and worship while usually rewarding his most faithful servants with gruesome deaths. King calls this a tale of dark Christianity in his forward, and one of the things I love about this book is that it does feel like a Biblical story, complete with contradictions and a moves-in-mysterious-ways factor. Stories don’t get much more epic than this, and King does a great job of depicting the meltdown of the world through the stories of a variety of relateable characters. (Larry Underwood remains among my favorite King creations.) One of my few complaints is that this features a lot of King’s anti-technology themes that he’d use in several books like Cell or The Dark Tower series. We’re told repeatedly that the ‘old ways’ like trying to get the power back on in Boulder are a ‘death trip’. The good guys gather in the Rocky Mountains, but if they try to get the juice going so they won’t freeze to death in the winter, they’re somehow acting in defiance of God’s will and returning to the bad habits? Not all tech is bad tech, Mr. King. Nature is a bitch and will kill your ass quicker than the superflu.Here’s another thing I’m not wild about. When this was published in the late ‘70s, the bean counters at King’s publishers had decided that the book as written would be too pricey in hardback and no one would pay a whopping $13 for a Stephen King hardback. So King cut about three hundred pages.Around 1990 after it had become apparent that King could publish his shopping list as a best seller, he put those pages back in and released the uncut version. Which I’m fine with. The original stuff was cut for a financial reason, not an editorial one, and there’s some very nice bits of story added in. If King would have stopped there, we would have had a great definitive final version as originally created by the author.Unfortunately, he seemed to catch a case of Lucasitis and decided to update the story a bit and change its original time frame from 1980 to 1990. I’m not sure why that seemed necessary to him. Yes, the book was a bit dated by then, but it was of its time. He didn’t rewrite the text (Which I’m grateful for.), but just stuck in some references to Madonna and Ronald Reagan and Spuds McKenzie. This led to a whole bunch of anachronisms. Would students in 1990 call soldiers ’war pigs’? Someone in New York picks up a phone book to look up the number to call an ambulance instead of dialing 911? A song called Baby, Can You Dig Your Man is a huge hit? None of it quite fits together. There's also a layer of male chauvinism and lack of diversity that you can overlook in a book written in the late '70s, but seems out of place for a book set and updated for 1990.The things that irritate me are still far outweighed by one of my favorite stories of an apocalyptic battle between good and evil.I’m also glad to get a long overdue audio edition of this book. Great narration and 40+ hours of end of the world horror make for a damn fine listening experience.","I loved this book. I read the uncut version years back when I lived in the States, maybe in 2002. I loved everything about it except the ending. I'm a big fan of Stephen King and have 23 of his books on my shelf. Stephen King can only write a good ending to a book by chance. That said, the first 95% of his books is generally so good that I can forgive the ending.One of the things I like best about King's writing is the way he breathes life into characters and every day settings. For a horror writer this is crucial. You have to make everything utterly believable so that when the monster comes and the stakes are raised the reader feels it's all real and cares about what's at stake. The short story, The Body, on which the film Stand By Me is based is a great example of King's genius at making complicated, flawed, awkward, real characters.Anyway, The Stand, is not typical King as the main core of it is an apocalypse, and the super natural horror element is rather secondary and low key for most of the story. The apocalypse is a believable one, a flu pandemic with a mortality rate so high that only a tiny fraction of the population survives. King tears the world down in terrifying slow motion and playing on our fears of pandemics it is at once horrifying, touching, and fascinating. King is great at slowly pulling everyday reality apart.The cast of characters who survive this catastrophe is sizeable, diverse, and interesting. A pyromaniac with an array of mental issues, a man with learning disabilities, a singer who was in the act of breaking big, others more ordinary but no less fascinating under pressure.The literary institutions of this world sniff at horror writers as much as they do fantasy writers but I find King's prose and insights into the human condition to be as powerful as those in many of the more plodding works of literary fiction I've read. Readers often don't notice it because it's not what they came for. But King is interested in people and how pressure acts on them.“No one can tell what goes on in between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side. Or you don't.” King shows us the inception of the disaster, plots its course through his scattered and varied cast, and slowly brings those actors together into two communities in the aftermath.The two communities we focus on centre on the supernatural aspect of the book, one of them is home to the 'good' folk, and the other to the 'bad'. The bad camp is ruled over by Randal Flagg who roams through the pages of quite a few of King's books, The Dark Tower in particular.The book concludes with the fight between these two camps and ultimately the ending was a touch unsatisfying for me, though not awful by any means. The journey to that ending however was a fascinating thrill ride and well worth the price of entry!If you've not tried Stephen King before then this is a fine place to jump in - be warned though, it is perhaps the longest of his books with a page count to rival GRRM at his most long winded.

Mexican Gothic,Silvia Moreno-Garcia,3.67,"Mexican Gothic is a sublime work of post-colonial gothic. It’s a story that unsettled me so effectively I found myself, on more than one occasion, helplessly desperate to claw my way out of my reading experience, to put a merciful distance between me and the words and the bleak and stifling horror that lies within. At the same time, however, I couldn’t. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. I felt utterly, helplessly compelled.In Mexican Gothic, Moreno-Garcia uses the familiar trappings of the Gothic genre—a house atop the hill, enshrouded in a brew of dark mist; a gently malevolent proprietor, beautiful but cold as a moonbeam; an entrapped woman, once uncontainable and full of life, growing frail as the shaft of a feather; and a looming dread, threatening to press everyone inside softly and heavily to the ground. The author, however, makes ample room to address and interrogate where the genre’s limitations exist and the forces that inform them, showing the reader something viciously, vividly new.The project of the novel underneath the poignant horror is a deliberate indictment of racism, colonization, class disparity, and abuse in all its forms. It’s a reckoning with history, and a return to the past, like following a path of blood or the pulse of a still-aching wound—and it makes for a sharp and vital undercurrent to the eerie and haunting atmosphere. Through her lucid and eerily sure-footed prose, Moreno-Garcia sinks the reader into a shadow-steeped, fog-drenched world where reality is turned slippery and slick and the past drags on like a nightmare. Her body horror is splashed out in blunt and nauseous detail, and the steady accretion of apprehension is so oppressively potent you can almost feel the watchful, thrumming presence of High Place clawing at your back.
“It wasn’t made for love, the house.”“Any place is made for love,” she protested.“Not this place and not us. You look back two, three generations, as far as you can. You won’t find love. We are incapable of such a thing.”
Speaking of, the novel’s setting—High Place—functions as a character in and of itself, so present and embodied and awakened. It’s the home of the eugenics-obsessed Doyle family whose pockets were made rich with gold the labor of Indigenous workers had put there. But the house is a perverse imitation of a home: it is a place where silence yawns like a chasm, cavernous and echoing; a place that is both corrupt and corrupting, a snake devouring its own tail. It's a place consumed by a wrongness so old and so pervasive that it never truly leaves such places. It is embedded in the mold-covered wallpaper, wedged into the supports of the house, needled into every woundlike crevice, humming darkly inside the walls and in the places no one ever ventures.This wrongness, the novel is careful to illustrate, is as deep-running as roots, spreading through generations like a species of fungus: the result of an endless, unbroken history of brown dreams wrecked and swallowed and devoured for the sake of white people’s wellness, of brown bodies poked and prodded for the innumerable ways in which they could be serviceably consumed, a relentless and hideous abrasion of dignity that is not unfamiliar to many people of color everywhere. Therein lies the novel's most unforgettable accomplishment: the horror in Mexican Gothic is so poignant, so stark and oppressively bleak precisely because it's recognizable. It’s racism and xenophobia and white supremacy recast as eldritch nastiness. Strip it of that—of the corrupting illness and the dreams choked with dreadful desire and all the things that lurk deep inside, sleepless and eager to have a go—and it’s real, and it’s vicious and brutally jolting in its sheer, inexorable reality. Horror, as a genre, offers a dim sanctuary: we read horror to escape, to let ourselves feel and exist through the shock and distress and crawling dread, secure in the knowledge that none of it is real, and that we are firmly in control. But there is no relief in waking up from this novel—this is the thing that exists outside your door, darkly reflective on the page, and you can’t escape it.
“There’re heavy places. Places where the air itself is heavy because an evil weighs it down. Sometimes it’s a death, could be it’s something else, but the bad air, it’ll get into your body and it’ll nestle there and weigh you down. That’s what’s wrong with the Doyles of High Place.”
One other triumphant aspect of this novel that I want to talk about lies with its protagonist, Noemí Taboada.The protagonist of Mexican Gothicc is no one’s damsel in distress, swooning prettily on a lover’s arm. Noemí Taboada is a bold, capable, and carelessly curious socialite hunting fun and living life at full blast in 1950s Mexico. She is a scintillating study in multidimensionally: Noemí can be as sweet as candied almonds, and she can be as sharp and tart as a lemon, and her doggedness in the pursuit of life’s capricious pleasures—fine gowns, fine parties, and fine cigarettes—are matched only by her determination to earn a Master’s degree in anthropology. Noemí has a satisfying vehemence to her, edged with bitter resentment against a world that wants to punish her for her ambition, for the sin of hunger. Because a hungry woman is dangerous: she is undutiful and unpliable and does not accept nor submit to intimidation, humiliation, or exotification. A hungry woman is entirely her own person, answerable to herself, and therefore she is considered “a bitch, and a bitch can hardly do anything: all avenues are closed to her.” I liked Noemí so much, and rooted for her so feverishly. She is a refreshing protagonist, and a colossally vital one. The author renders her voice as permeable as sand, keeping us pressed close to her mind, feeling the raw edges of her anxiety and the whip-crack urgency of her desperation with a piercing keenness. As a result, the gaslighting and the tender manipulation threaded through the quiet lines of Mexican Gothic—and which Noemí is subject to—become as dreadfully effective as the body horror. The Doyle’s persecution of Noemí—deliberate, unyielding, and sadistic—sought to wear at her sanity like water against stone, to shrink her down to a pliable and docile facsimile of her cousin, and it was so utterly convincing I found myself sweating a little, squirming in my seat in profound discomfort. Even worse, I felt my own certainties unraveling, right alongside Noemí’s. It was profoundly chilling, and I was chilled by it, but I was also impressed. Impressed at the author’s inerrant ability to twist her reader’s feelings like a bit of ribbon, to entrap and tantalize and wrong-foot, to show you all the workings and still make you fall headlong into the shiny trap of it. At the end, I resurfaced from Mexican Gothic feeling both exhilarated and exhausted with words, sighing with the horrified relief of a hundred pages' worth of held breath finally expelled, but unable to shake off this novel for days afterwards. This is what I've come to recognize as the gorgeous marker of a well-told story: wonderful and terrible and, like a childhood memory, impossible to escape. Highly recommended!","Yessss! Congratulations! This book won the Goodreads Choice Awards by beating king of the authors ( yes, with so many votes it beat Mr. King’s It Bleeds) !🎉🌈💕🎈🥳🥂Hell yeah! This deliciously terrifying, gothic adventure will be adapted to Hulu limited series! I cannot wait to binge watch! What an amazing news!🥳🥂💃🏻🕺🏼OMG! I had no brain right now! The author stole it! I wish she would have put some bravery into my heart because I think I’m not gonna sleep at least for a week and I already brought back Christmas ornaments and enlightened house (I don’t have any idea how much electric bill will coast next month but I’m sure my husband will have the worst scream crying experience of his lifetime.)This book is insanely terrifying, spin-tingling, horrifying, mind blowing, eyes popping, tear jerker (nope it’s not emotional, you cry like a baby because you realize you just pissed your pants when you were reading it and you’re dying from humiliation! I’ve been there!), paranoid, a dangerous dancing between Mexican folklore, horror stories and Darwin’s theory of natural selection. You want to throw the book and start running outside from your house. ( I took 5 tours around Sunset Boulevard at the rush hour and was saluted by angry drivers’ flipping birds but I didn’t care! Running gave me endorphin and adrenalin I needed.)Here is the eerie, ominous, petrifying plot of the book: Noemi is sent to High Place after her father gets an awkward and suspicious letter from her cousin Catalina, recently got married. The letter implied that she’s suffering from a mental illness or there’s something really wrong about her husband Virgil’s mansion. So Noemi goes there to check her cousin’s medical condition and learn the truth hid behind her letter.But as she takes a few steps to the house, she feels that something is really really wrong about the place : she’s introduced to Virgil’s family resembles us Manson Family meets Adam Family. Yes, they’re completely weird, living by strict rules, having marriages in family, covering the house’s walls with deceased brides. And there is a big tragedy still affects the soul of the house: a daughter kills her family members and commits suicide.So as a normal person, Noemi should cry for help and run as soon as she meets that eerie people, including control freak, demanding Florence, flirting and nasty Virgil, the maids who act like they swore to silence and don’t forget about Howard reminds us of long time zombie extra of Walking Dead ( I think he’s soul-mate of woman in bath in Shining!) And only normal person of the family is naïve, artistic, shy son of Florence: Francis who loves to talk about fungus.I’m not gonna give much spoiler but this riveting, heart shattering, blood freezing, scary book has so many alerting elements including ghosts, sleepwalking, violence, bloodshed, disgusting and extreme vulgarity. It’s so different from the first book of the author but if you ask my opinion that did I enjoy it? Of course I truly did! I tested my pain endurance levels. I screamed a lot and I was flabbergasted, speechless at some chapters. And ending, yes it’s volatile, blasting but also satisfying.This means… here comes another gazillion five stars. But quick note: when you’re reading this book, don’t try to eat your mushroom pizza as like I did. I don’t like to write what happened to me afterwards…This is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO twisted, unexpected, gory, exhilarating! I don’t know a sequel comes after that! But if author decides to write it, I’d be happily to consume it without thinking a second!Sooooo much special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing/Ballantine for sharing this fantastic ARC and making my wish come true in exchange my honest review. And I personally congratulate Silvia Moreno-Garcia for this heart throbbing, extra ordinary book.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","""I pray I'll see you again. You must come for me, Noemí. You have to save me.""WHEW. You think you know where this book is going, and then it goes there. Mexican Gothic begins in such an unassuming way, where you think you're walking into a traditional haunted house story, and then everything shifts to pull you under like a riptide that doesn't loosen until you turn the final page. Before I dive into my review, I think it's fair to note that the majority of this book is atmospheric, character driven, and the slowest burn imaginable; for me, this worked spectacularly well, as I love to feel completely absorbed into the narrative in horror novels. And yes friends, this is most definitely a horror novel. I'll include content warnings in a spoiler tag below for those who are interested. ""Noemí's father said she cared too much about her looks and parties to take school seriously, as if a woman could not do two things at once.""Maybe the reason why this slow burn worked so well for me is because I instantly connected with Noemí; she is confident, intelligent, and the life of the party. When her father receives a suspicious letter from Noemí's cousin, Catalina, he sends Noemí to investigate and report back. As expected, everyone involved gets more than they bargained for, and what begins as a handful of unusual occurrences slowly morphs into a whirlwind of horrifying circumstances.""This house, she was sure, was haunted. She wasn't one for believing in things that go bump in the night either, but right that second she firmly felt every spook and demon and evil thing might be crawling about the earth, like in Catalina's stories.""One of the things I loved the most about this story is how vastly different the haunted house felt. The author has successfully blended the traditional aspects of the old, decrepit, ghost filled residence and a new, more modern aspect, one I won't go into detail of for fear of spoiling the big twist. I think she nailed it on the head when she stated in her Goodreads interview that this book is for the reader who is both classy and trashy, because it has the high entertainment value that fast fiction lovers rejoice in, but it is also filled with beautifully devastating prose. If you, too, have a love affair with all things that go bump in the night, Mexican Gothic should be your top priority this summer. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to those who have a desire to spend long hours in a derelict house and an iron stomach. ""The truth was she was afraid of going to bed, of what nightmares might uncoil in the dark. What did people do after witnessing the horrors they had seen? Was it possible to slip back into normality, to play pretend and go on? She wanted to think this was exactly the case, but she was afraid sleep would prove her wrong.""*Content Warning: Sexual assault, incest, murder and gore, cannibalism, themes challenging white supremacy and eugenics, discussions surrounding the death of a parent and other family members, miscarriages and stillbirths, discussions surrounding suicide, and the consumption of alcohol and smoking.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy."
House of Leaves,Mark Z. Danielewski,4.09,"So there's a definite cult around this book, and I am one of the many who drank the Kool-Aide and never looked back. Here's a little anecdote that speaks to the possibilities of this book:I was an RA my junior and senior years of college. One year I had a good friend of mine living in my building, and upon one of her visits to my room I put The House of Leaves in her hand, telling her that she should read it. A couple of days later I was in my room, awake at some unholy hour due to my vampiric sleep schedule, and there's a knock at my door. As an RA this is a rather unsettling experience. On the other side of that door could be a drug overdose, suicide attempt, food poisoning or any other host of problems we're warned about as RAs. So tentatively I open the door and am relieved to find that it is not some horrific medical emergency, but simply my friend. Except my friend looks haggard. Her hair is unkempt, there are bags under her eyes and she is slouched forward, breaking her usually quite nice posture. In her hand is The House of Leaves. We stand there, silently measuring each other up, and then my friend rears back and throws the book at me, then walks away. Such behavior is not terribly unusual for this friend of mine, so I make a note to ask about this later and then go back to bed.The next day I call up my friend and ask her what exactly was the deal. ""I hadn't slept in two days,"" she said. ""That damn book kept me awake. I couldn't finish it, I couldn't sleep with it in the room, I had to get rid of it. That book fucked me up."" To this day she still can't bring herself to finish reading the book. And so.The book has an amazing way of crawling beneath your skin and taking root. When I read it my sleep schedule, already astoundingly bad, became even more irregular and bizarro. I started looking at things differently. The world changed. Not in any big way, but there was a definite shift, and that's the way this book works. It comes at you sideways. People who just see it as a gimmick, in my opinion, are trying to hit the book straight on when you just have to give into it. It's like music, which isn't surprising seeing as how Mark Z. Danielewski's sister is the recording artist Poe, who came up with her album Haunted in tandem with Danielewski's writing of House of Leaves. There are sections of this book I found so surprising and affecting that I had to put it down and give myself a minute to take in what I'd read and go over it in my mind. Every person I've ever met who has read this book has had something to say about it, something more personal than just ""Oh yeah, I liked that,"" or ""It's overhyped."" There's a visceral reaction this book can elicit, and I find that fascinating.I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday and she mentioned something David Mamet said once, something along the lines of ""When you leave the theater wanting to discuss the play, that's a good play. When you leave the theater wanting to discuss your life and the world, that's art."" I like that definition, and I think it applies to House of Leaves. Conversations about this book never stay on the book, they branch out into other areas and interests, they can't help but grow longer and deeper, not entirely unlike a five minute hallway.","Looking for a spooky book to read around Halloween I was recommended this book by several others on a message board I frequent. Quite a few people mentioned its brilliance and the fear it put in them.After reading it I could not disagree more. The story is this: a family moves into a home and begins noticing physical features of their house changing. They begin to investigate, which leads to a new doorway and hall appearing where there was not one. The husband, being a world class explorer and filmographer decides to document the new house and in doing so creates a documentary, ala ""The Blair Witch Project."" But the book has a couple stories within the story. It is written from the point of view of some young slacker who breaks into this dead old man's house and takes the notes for a book the old dude is writing. The book and all of these notes are his reactions to watching the documentary film.The old man's ramblings reads like a textbook, replete with tons of footnotes, fake references, poems, rantings. But we don't get to just read his reaction, or simply walk through the documentary, we have to suffer through the slacker's constant juvenile side stories and craziness.The premise is brilliant, and flipping through the book the first time, I was pumped at the prospect of the book. The effort Daniel put into this book is exhausting to say the least. This had to have taken countless hours for the detail to all of the fake references, quotes, drawings, and footnotes, but sadly at the center is a stupid story that goes no where. I was never scared, but rather annoyed. NOTHING seems to happen. And as soon as the story begins to move, we get a long winded worthless conversation from our main character. Nothing is ever explained, nor finalized. This is seriously one of the most boring, meandering, monotonous books I have read.While reading the book I found a message board dedicated to the book and its absolute greatness. It took all I had not to log in and question the taste and objectivity of these people, but if they like it, who am I to pee on them.I do not recommend this book, but if you do read it and turn out to enjoy it, please enlighten me as to what I missed as I fought falling asleep reading these boring passages.","If you want a really good, insightful review of House of Leaves (that I didn't write), go read this one from Aerin.If you want to read mine, here you go:House of Leaves isn't one of those tidy little things that holds your hand and wipes your bottom and tells you that you're special. It makes you work, and what you get out of it depends largely on how much work you're willing to do. House of Leaves is difficult at times, incredibly complex, occasionally pretentious, and  it doesn't neatly wrap up some of the biggest questions it raises.When I finished it, I thought I was unsatisfied with the ending, but it lived in me long after I closed the book. I could not stop thinking about the characters, the puzzles, my various theories about the nature of the story and  whether Zampano existed at all, or was just invented by Johnny Truant.Here's the thing about House of Leaves: you can enjoy it simply as a horrifying story that could possibly be true. You could enjoy it as a love story on a number of different levels. You can enjoy it as a whole bunch of puzzles and codes and ciphers. You can enjoy it as a unique reading experience that will make you fall back in love with actual paper books.But however you choose to enjoy it, you've got to just commit to it. Let the book's reality capture you, and ride it out until you finish the book. When you're done, you'll probably find that the House has taken up some space inside you, and you'll wonder if the nightmares will actually come, assuming they haven't already.You'll go back to the beginning, and you'll reread sections large and small. You'll take a magnifying glass to the pictures and you'll spend a long time reading message boards that haven't been updated since 2004. You'll grab that copy of Poe's Haunted that you bought before you knew House of Leaves existed, and you'll listen to it again in an entirely new way.You'll discover that you live at the end of a five and a half minute hallway....Or maybe you won't. Maybe it won't live in you the way it lives in me... but it's worth your time to find out."
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,"Shirley Jackson, Jonathan Lethem (Afterword)",3.92,"Bizarre, strange, haunting, sinister, disturbing, twisted, foreboding, suffocatingly claustrophobic, leaving you with the ever-growing sense of unease. What else can I say about this book to give it justice?This is a chillingly terrifying story that has nothing to do with the things that go BUMP in the night. No, it's the odd terror that comes when things go BUMP in the mind. And the most terrifying things are those that are left unsaid, that creep up at you from behind the printed lines, just hinted at and left for your own brain to chillingly realize.
“My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in our family is dead.” 



Behind the events of the story is the mystery of the Blackwood family, rich New England landowners who are quite well-aware of their presumed class-snobbish superiority over the inhabitants of the nearby village; the family which is in turn met with distrust, fear and even hatred - not quite unfounded, actually. You see, six years ago half of the members of the Blackwood family were poisoned by arsenic in their food. Three are left: Uncle Julian, left crippled by the poison, hanging on to the remnants of his mind, obsessed with the tragedy of the day of the murder; Constance, an agoraphobiac trapped in the narrow confines of her domestic universe, cooking for the remnants of her family with a strained chirpy attitude - a young woman who was also the cook on the day of the fateful arsenic poisoning and therefore is considered the poisoner in the eyes of the villagers; and Mary Katherine, Merricat, the narrator of the story, now eighteen, who was sent to her room without dinner on the day of the poisoning, who now serves as a link between her diminished and scorned family and the rest of the world.For a careful reader, the identity of the poisoner is really very easy to figure out after the first few pages. The psychological impact is never about the identity, it's about the implications of it. And that's what gives it a real punch.
“I am going to put death in all their food and watch them die.”
This strange little family survives without ever deviating from their strict routines, remaining shut off from the outside world until one day an unexpected arrival threatens the fragile stability - of the family and of Merricat's mind. And the events that follow lead to the scariest and saddest ending presented in the most chillingly subtle way possible.
“I would have liked to come into the grocery some morning and see them all, even the Elberts and the children, lying there crying with the pain of dying. I would help myself to groceries, I thought, stepping over their bodies, taking whatever I fancied from the shelves, and go home, with perhaps a kick for Mrs.Donell while she lay there. I was never sorry when I had thoughts like this; I only wished they would come true.""



Our narrator, Merricat Blackwood, is not a character you can easily forget. She is written with such skill, with such vividness, with such persuasion that the pages come alive with her bizarre voice of a seemingly adult woman forever trapped in neverending childhood, in the world of twisted magical reality of strange rituals and special objects and strict routine that can never be changed, or else.
""On Sunday morning the change was one day nearer. I was resolute about not thinking my three magic words and would not let them into my mind, but the air of change was so strong that there was no avoiding it; change lay over the stairs and the kitchen and the garden like fog. I would not forget my magic words; they were MELODY GLOUCESTER PEGASUS, but I refused to let them into my mind.""
And the scariest thing of all to me was how more and more enthralling Merricat's voice became with every page, with every minute spent inside her head, until it's hard not to take her side despite all the implications that it carries, despite reason suggesting otherwise, despite knowledge of what's going on. And that's when you realize the magnetic pull Merricat has, holding her little world together in the ways that suit her - little world it may be, but it's wholly her own, steadily holding against anything that can be perceived as a disturbance, an interference, a threat. And the words of her little game in the summerhouse take on a new resonance.
 “Bow your heads to our beloved Mary Katherine…or you will be dead.”
I found this book deeply disturbing in its deceiving simplicity, and scarily engrossing - the book written by an oddball ostracized agoraphobiac obsessed with food and trapped in her own little universe by the last years of her life. Shirley Jackson's Constance and Merricat, securely huddled in their own little corner of the world, not accepted but feared and left alone, the heart of legends and superstitions - was it in a way a cry for help or an unattainable dream? I don't know, and I think I sleep better precisely because I don't know.Unflinching 5 stars and a shudder at the seemingly so innocent of an ending:“Oh Constance, we are so happy.”——————Also posted on my blog.","This book is a masterpiece. It is short and spare and written in crystal clear prose, yet so evocative that it is richer in nuance than most good novels twice its size. It is so good I could kick myself for not reading it years ago, yet so mythic I am convinced I have known it always, like a tragic folktale or a chilling childhood dream. And yet, for all its grimness, it is essentially a comedy: darkly, transcendently, funny.The Blackwood sisters—28-year-old Constance and 18-year-old Mary Katharine—live in a big old house on the outskirts of town. They are fitfully persecuted by the locals, who are convinced one of them is a murderer: their whole family—with the exception of scatterbrained Uncle Julian—was poisoned with arsenic six years ago. Now the three survivors—along with their black cat Jonas—are living together in deliberate tranquility, when long-lost cousin Charles arrives on their doorstep, barely concealing his interest in the lovely Constance and the Blackwood family estate.The narrative voice of Merrycat—nickname for Mary Katherine—is perhaps the most distinctive thing about the novel. Deceptively childlike, obsessed with omens, magic words, and lucky days, Merrycat is nevertheless a clear and sharp-eyed observer of the day-to-day events of her world. Her naive shrewdness speaks to us like Huckleberry Finn’s, her quirkiness charms us like Holden Caulfield’s, yet she possesses a distance, a reserve, that is all her own.Those of you who read novels like autobiographies will find tantalizing tidbits here. The local village resembles Jackson’s North Bennington, Vermont, a place Jackson always felt treated her family as outsiders (college eggheads, Democrats, atheists, Jews) and provided her the inspiration for her notorious early success, “The Lottery."" The two sisters were inspired by Jackson’s two daughters, the placid and cautious Constance by Joanne and the superstitious and daring Merrycat by Sarah. But of course Jackson drew on herself for inspiration too, particularly from her fascination with witchcraft and sympathetic magic and her persistent, crippling agoraphobia. And Cousin Charles resembles her husband, in his critical comments about the housekeeping and his continual concerns about money. (Although husband Stanley was a literary critic, his wife Shirley was the literary cash cow of the family, and he once calculated precisely how much money was lost whenever his wife wasted her valuable time composing a letter to a friend.)Perhaps what I like best about the book—besides the dark humor, and the voice of Merrycat of course—is its sweet and sad conclusion. After the destruction has passed and gone—a climax which reveals the full impact of the novel’s title—we witness a family rebuild an old life out of love, and even glimpse a little human compassion for a change. It is the twilight happiness of Shakespeare’s Winter’s Tale and The Tempest, the kind of happiness Lear and Cordelia might have enjoyed, if they had lived.Here is the novel’s famous first paragraph, which gives you a good idea of Merrycat’s distinctive voice:
My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death cap mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.","I might be the only person in the world who thinks this book is too weird, senseless, anticlimactic and almost plotless. The characters however are charismatic in their craziness. It's just not my type of crazy."

It seemed strange to me, though, that I still hadn't read one of the more important ones. Now, I don't think it's because this book is particularly brilliant or a masterpiece. Yet it does represent an important paradigm shift in the representation of vampires in modern literature. Whilst Vampires are still unaccountably evil in this novel, they are also relatable, capable of sparking our empathy and intimate to us on a level not really seen previously to this novel.Published in 1976, it is the story of the world's most boring vampire, Louis. Okay, I take that back, ALMOST the world's most boring vampire...[image error]Excellent, now that our obligatory Twilight reference is out of the way, we can get on with the review!We've come a long way from the original publication of Interview With a Vampire. Previous to this novel, a story about Vampires was generally a horror novel and nobody expected Vampires to turn out to be the good guys. Now they are almost guaranteed to be, at the most, misunderstood.Like our current generation of teenagers...As far as I can see in my research, this seems to be the place where Vampire Empathizing began or at least was made popular. I wanted to know if The Lost Boys, Blade, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Anita Blake, Vampire Diaries, Twilight et al owe their existence to Interview With A Vampire and if they've done it justice.Well, I've been searching for a Vampire novel or movie that is as much of a pop culture icon, that displays tenets of Vampire Empathizing and which predates Interview With a Vampire but so far my search hasn't revealed much.As for how this novels stands up to the wealth of vampire media that followed it? Well, in some aspects I think it is a vast improvement. The idea of Vampires being the dark seducer isn't new and using them to represent repressed sexuality has become stock standard. However this book deals with those two themes in a very different way. The dark seducer, Lestat, and the repressed sexual being, Claudia, both destroy Louis in vastly different ways and it's a nice, depressing change from the usual state of affairs.But still, on its own, it's not a fantastic book. It may have popularized Vampire Empathizing, but it's probably also responsible for a lot of terrible gothic poetry.And in case you're wondering if the movie is better than the book? In this instance, yes. Though I can't say why...I'm not sure what the movie has that the book doesn't...Or what makes the movie more intriguing...But it sure is SOMETHING!"
Doctor Sleep,Stephen        King,4.13,"There is a boy (now a man) a girl, a band of baddies with a charismatic leader, a coalition of the willing, battles to be fought, supernatural elements and magical powers. Stephen King was at this long before Harry Potter lived under the stairs. He has a preternatural (not to say supernatural) talent for writing kids, and can keep you turning pages, losing sleep, and getting back late to work from your lunch breaks. from King’s site We will presume for the purposes of this review that you have read, or at least seen one version of The Shining. If you have not, read no further, as there are details here that would be considered spoilerish were they to appear in a review of that book. And if you have not read The Shining you should probably do so before taking on Doctor Sleep, a sequel. Ok, everyone here has read The Shining, yes? All right, but we are using the honor system here, and do not want to ruin the fun of reading that one for anyone. So, as long as you’re sure…At the end of The Shining, three people survive the carnage, Danny Torrance, a five year old with a special gift, Wendy Torrance, Danny’s mother and newly widowed wife of the late Jack Torrance, and Dick Halloran, an employee of The Overlook and possessor of a gift like Danny’s, one that allowed him to hear Danny’s psychic 911 call and return from his home in Florida in time to do something about it. What happened next? King does not typically do sequels, if one does not count books that are part of a planned series, but Every now and then somebody would ask, ‘Whatever happened to Danny?’ I used to joke around and say, ‘He married Charlie McGee from Firestarter and they had these amazing kids!’ But I did sort of wonder about it. – (from EW)One of the central features of The Shining was Jack’s Torrance’s battle with alcoholism. As with the real world, King’s fictional realm notes that alcoholism runs in families. And one of the criticisms of The Shining was that the possibility of Jack considering getting some help from AA is never even raised. If King has ever considered that to have been an oversight, I have not seen that interview. But it is clear that he has given the matter some thought. Jack Torrance never tries Alcoholics Anonymous. That is never even mentioned in ""The Shining."" He has what they call white-knuckle sobriety. He's doing it all by himself. So, I wondered what it would be like to see Danny first as an alcoholic, and then see him in AA. (from an NPR Interview)Ewan McGregor as Danny Torrance in the filmIt gives nothing away to let you know that Danny is a true Torrance. Not only does he self-medicate to quiet the terrors that still haunt him, he is far from the best person he can be.I knew if I did this sequel I’d have to try to put together some of the same elements, but at the same time I didn’t want to make it too similar. I didn’t want to make Danny a grown up with kids of his own, and try to replicate that whole losing-your-temper-because-you’re-drunk thing. But I did think to myself: ‘Not only alcoholism can be a family disease, but rage can be a family disease.’ You find that the guys who abuse their children were abused themselves as kids. That certainly fit Danny as I knew him. – from EW
All SK novels require a baddie, or a set of them. No disappointment here. King has again succeeded in taking the ordinary and making it horrifying.Driving back and forth from Maine to Florida, which I do twice a year, I’m always seeing all these recreational vehicles — the bounders in the Winnebagos. I always think to myself, ‘Who is in those things?’ You pass them a thousand times at rest stops. They’re always the ones wearing the shirts that say ‘God Does Not Deduct From a Lifespan Time Spent Fishing.’ They’re always lined up at the McDonald’s, slowing the whole line down. And I always thought to myself, ‘There’s something really sinister about those people because they’re so unobtrusive, yet so pervasive.’ I just wanted to use that. It would be the perfect way to travel around America and be unobtrusive if you were really some sort of awful creature. – from EW
This wandering band call themselves The True Knot. They feed on the essence of those gifted with the sort of talent people like Danny possess. It provides them with extraordinary longevity, but as with their Transylvanian counterparts, the need is ongoing and the supply is limited. Like right-wing politicians they are more than happy to gorge on the pain of others and are shown here feasting on the spirits set adrift on 9/11. The usual condiments for this substance they call steam will not do. The taste and benefit is enhanced, however, if their victims endure extreme and prolonged torture. Does Ted Cruz drive a Winnebago? King gives the members Damon Runyon-esque names, like Crow Daddy, Steamboat Steve and Tommy the Truck.By the time you finish reading Doctor Sleep you might have a new image of the top hat to consider next time you are planning a formal night out. We all have one, probably this one:But the baddie in Stephen King’s latest is likely to do for the top hat what this guydid for the derby. Rose O’Hara, the leader of a group called The True Knot, won’t leave home without it. It adds a nice visual element, calling to mind a certain Caribbean Baron, and making Rosie even more riveting. Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat- from the filmAnd what of our young heroine? Abra is born with a shining of prodigious proportions. (btw, the name Abra was inspired by Abra Bacon, a character in East of Eden) She manages to send out a signal even when she is newly arrived. She’s a good kid, despite scaring her parents on occasion with tricks like making all the silverware in the kitchen take to the air, or causing the odd earthquake when she does a mental Bruce (or if you prefer, David) Banner. Don’t make her angry. You wouldn’t like her when she’s angry. Bad-ass teen girl power fuh shoo-uh. But, just as Danny needed Dick Hallorann and Tony, Abra needs help as well. That she and Danny will team up is a foregone conclusion. As for Danny, the shining never left him, despite his attempts to wipe it out with spirits of a different sort. But he finds the help he needs and manages to put his talent to good use. He works in a hospice, the Helen Rivington House, in Frazier, NH, easing the transition for those near death, with the assistance of a resident feline, and earning himself the name Doctor Sleep, which also serves to remind us of what his parents called him.…It is this moment of transition that Doctor Sleep deals with and the idea, like so many of King's, came from an incidental story in a newspaper. This one was about ""a cat in a hospice that knows when people are going to die. He would go into that patient's room and curl up next to them. And I thought, that's a good advertisement for death, for the emissary of death. I thought, 'I can make Dan the human equivalent of that cat, and call him Doctor Sleep.' There was the book."" – from an interview in The Guardian
King has a bit of fun, naming the cat Azzie, short for Azreel, the archangel of death. Cute. Azzie - the real Doctor Sleep - image from TheReelBits.comWhat else do you need, really? Dark vs light, colorful baddies vs our everyman and everygirl. And that is indeed enough. But it is not all that King uses. He gives us a look at how people can really help people overcome, or at least handle their problems. When asked, in the NPR interview, whether his AA depictions were from personal experience, King says that the second part of AA stands for Anonymous, so he declined to offer a yes or no, however You could say, having read these two books and knowing that I was a very heavy drinker at the time that I wrote ""The Shining,"" and I haven't had a drink in about 25 years now - you could draw certain conclusions from that…I've done a lot of personal research in these subjects. - from NPR interview
AA figures very large in this story, is central really. And the wisdom one can find in AA permeates the novel, from the importance of recognizing that we need help from others, to accepting our past and dealing with it, a very strong, serious element. Kyleigh Curran as Abra Stone - image from the gww.comKing sets the time of the events by referring to external realities, like who the president is, calls on contemporary cultural references, such as a mention of the  Sons of Anarchy and a Hank Wiliams Jr song. He also mentions a variety of other writers in his travels, some approvingly, (John Sandford, George Seferis, Bernard Malamud, Bill Wilson) some not so much (the authors of the Twilight and Hunger Games series, and Dean Koontz and Lisa Gardner, although he may merely be playing with the latter two). He also drops in an Easter egg reference to Salem’s Lot and make two references (that I caught anyway) to his son, Joe’s, imagined world from Joe’s book, NOS4A2. It has been my experience with reading Stephen King that his conclusions sometimes offer a poor partner to the journey one takes in reaching them. That is much less the case here. The ending is not an alien spider disguised as Tim Curry with bad fashion sense or alien young playing with humans in a ham-fisted manner. And the journey is indeed fun. But I had some gripes. King gives Dick Hallorann a cameo here, which was fine, and the strongest of those. Tony returns for a look-see but goes alarmingly quiet at crucial moments. We could have used a lot more about Tony other than the weak explanation that is offered near the end. If the True Knot are so bad-ass, how come there are so few of them? There is an explanation offered of prey-predator stability of numbers, but I found that unpersuasive. And why the hell introduce Jack if he is not going to be a part of the action?  This is one that actively irked. Sequels present a danger. One of the things that is stimulating about any book, any story is newness. That is why most sequels are not as popular as their predecessors. It is hard to avoid a been-there-done-that problem when working atop existing material. The next story in line is unlikely to retain the sparkle, the shine of what went before. Given the constraints, Doctor Sleep fares better than most as a follow-on. There is enough distance in the story from the events of the past, and little enough overlap with those characters that the story seems fresh. When events from The Shining are mentioned, they do inform the current action and do not distract much. In fact there could have been more of that. So, in that way, this is a very nice addition. There is another element involved. Any event, any activity, is a product of the thing itself and of the perspective from which we view or participate in it. I read The Shining many years ago. I was an adult then, in my late twenties, and remember it as a VERY SCARY story. I have not come across much in horror lit that is still scary in that way, in the several decades since. I will not have any nights (on in my case days) of lost sleep because of the images King has proferred. But then, I am getting on, and am looking at those scary things with aging eyes. Someone younger (which would be almost all of you reading this) might find them far more frightening than I did. So while Doctor Sleep might not cause much by way of lost rest, it is good, mainstream Stephen King and thus, hardly a snooze. The Doctor of Horror is in.

=======In the summer of 2019 GR reduced the allowable review size by 25%. As a result it was necessary to export the EXTRA STUFF to Comment #5 below","should’ve left this one in the drafts, mr. king1/12","Dan: Hi, I was a total scumbag, meaning I once swiped a few bucks, a horrible horrible thing for which I'll never forgive myself, and, oh yeah, almost forgot, I used to get in bar fights all the time and I for all I know, I killed people during a blackout. Anyhoo, nowadays I'm heroic. Seriously, I'm pretty much a saint. I have magic powers and it never even crosses my mind to profit from them.Abra: Hi, I'm a totally normal teen, you can tell because of all my pop references! Game of Thrones! Fruit Ninja! I'm also all heroic, like, totally! I also have no imagination at all, just like Dan.Both: Together, we fight crime!Rose: Hi, I'm Rose, I'm super scary! Did you notice how convenient it is that we can't fly in planes? I mean, convenient for the heroes, not for me. We also are too good to use guns, despite the fact that we're as easy to kill, if not easier, than an ordinary human. Seriously, how the hell did we survive in medieval Europe, when getting around was a serious ordeal? Especially when me and my gang are hilariously incompetent. Anyway, I have a really cool hat."
Tender Is the Flesh,"Agustina Bazterrica, Sarah Moses (Translator)",3.78,"Many might say that a book dealing with the level of brutality and horrific subject matter that makes up this book could never be thoughtful or highbrow. I disagree with that. I definitely think literature depicting graphic violence doesn't automatically disqualify it from being anything more than an assault on the senses or torture porn. I think it can lay out valuable examinations of so many aspects of society that deserve to be scrutinized, all while remaining allegorical. Battle Royale by Koushun Takami (as well as its film adaptation) is just one example of a successful novel of this nature.Unfortunately, Tender Is The Flesh didn't live up to that expectation for me.It truly is brimming with brutality. In fact, that's all it is, is brutal. A virus that turns animal meat poisonous to humans causes humans to slaughter every non-human animal and begin factory farming human beings for food instead. You would think that a concept such as: ""imagine what the world would be like if humans were treated the way we treat animals in factory farms"" would have a lot to say. Just think about the fact that in the western part of the world, most people don't think twice about eating certain animals as food, but will get disgusted, enraged and even downright racist when other cultures in other parts of the world eat animals westerners don't view as 'food animals'. Or the fact that most people eat fish, have no qualms with the concept of fishing, but will protest whale hunting as it applies to various Indigenous cultures, particularly Inuit. I could go on and on. The point is, a book with this concept could tackle some serious societal issues - environmental destruction, racism, health, food insecurity, speciesism, etc. As I entered this book and continued reading through it, I often wondered, ""are we going to examine which humans are deemed 'food humans' in a meaningful way? Does it even matter? Does race, class, sexuality, or anything come into play in this near-future dystopian world that so closely could resemble our own?""And the answer is no. Because this book unpacks nothing.There were certainly minor suggestions toward some things, but they were quickly set aside in order to either continue describing the horrific acts inflicted upon these farmed humans, or to meander on about mundane things in the main character's personal life that ended up having little to no significance on the overall story. We didn't even really get anything in the way of showing how people came to accept this cannibalistic way of life, or how those who work in these factories are affected in their personal lives. The closest we get to a glimpse of this is the main character essentially being described as not caring one way or another, human or non-human slaughter, because he was only in the industry in order to pay for his father's nursing home. I'm sorry, but that is just not well-rounded enough for me as a reader. There was even the compelling hint at an ongoing conspiracy theory that the virus was faked by governments in order to deceive society into cannibalism as a means to alleviate overpopulation. However, this subplot peters out pretty quickly, but only after having a group of teenage boys briefly bring up the conspiracy's existence in conversation while graphically killing a litter of puppies they found in an abandoned zoo. Again, it's brutality for the sake of brutality and seemingly nothing else.Of course, I don't need -and I know many other readers don't need- literature or any form of entertainment to have a big, glaring moral spoonfed to me/us. Despite all that I've said, I hope it doesn't seem like I'm implying I didn't like this book because it didn't hold my hand while leading me through a clear and precise commentary of my own biases. I don't need that. But if a book is to be this grotesque in its depictions, I do think it should either go completely nihilistic (and thus let that speak for itself) or have at least something compelling to show for it. I think, overall, this book felt incomplete to me and that's my biggest gripe. The author certainly had ideas, but because her world-building was weak and her writing offered little in the way of depth, those ideas never really broke the surface and ended up fizzling out before anything of interest or import could come of it.Underneath all its gruesomeness, shock value and gore, it's actually a super boring book.","I have always believed that in our capitalist, consumerist society, we devour each other. - Agustina BazterricaThis story is really disturbing, and it isn't until the very last page that it becomes clear just how deeply disturbing it is.Tender Is the Flesh is an Argentinian import from an author who is apparently very popular in her own country. After reading this, dare I ask what other horrors she has created? This dystopian horror story is set in a world that feels so close to our own, except a zoonotic virus has made it so that all animals have had to be destroyed. To fill the gap in the meat market, people start to breed and farm humans for their meat.It is as horrifying and gory as it sounds. Extra warning for those sensitive to scenes of sexual assault and animal cruelty. But while it is hard to stomach at times, I was morbidly fascinated by what Bazterrica had to say about the way humans take advantage of other humans because they can get away with it. The book is horribly convincing and believable. We only have to look to our own real world to recall the excuses humans have made to enslave other humans and to shuttle them off to extermination camps. It does not take a huge suspension of disbelief to imagine the events of this book could happen.The book also focuses on the way language is used to make humans feel better about committing atrocities. No one is allowed to say ""cannibalism"" and the meat in the book is packaged as ""special meat"". There's some dark humour, too, with a few prods at the hypocrisy of humans being outraged by slavery at the same time as imprisoning and eating other humans.It is told in third person limited and follows Marcos Tejo who works at a meat plant. He takes us through all the horrors involved with breeding, killing, flaying and packaging humans, whilst also dealing with the loss of his own infant son. For such a bleak tale, it is surprisingly compelling. All the time while reading I was wondering what on earth the conclusion of this nightmare could leave us with, but I think it was even more effective than I could have imagined.","One of the most relentless and ugly books I've ever read. A book that describes a society where humans are slaughtered for meat, in more detail than I was ready for. This novel willfully refuses to allow itself to fall into any category of fiction that would make it easier to take as a reader. The flat direct style of its prose didn't allow me, as I read along, to think of it as horror, or satire, or a metaphorical representation of social injustice, or a nihilistic moral thesis about humanity. It is exactly what it is. Never boring, it managed to continue to shock me until its final pages.In 2010 Roger Ebert reviewed the cult movie The Human Centipede  and wrote: I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine. That goes for this novel, as well. If forced to give stars, I would give it five stars, for the way it relentlessly fulfills its purpose."
Firebird,Juliette Cross,3.64,"I know 2 things:1. This Romantasy is going to blow up when it comes out 2. I did not like it one bitNow that we both know these two things, let’s proceed with caution shall we? This is a story about a witch blessed with emphatic magic to feel and control the emotions of others. She is captured by an infamous Roman general who is immediately captivated by her and makes her his body slave. In this world the Roman Empire is obviously corrupt and lots of people are actually dragons. The general (love interest) is keeping secrets and is probably not as evil as his reputation would have you believe. Before I unleash my inner rath let me say 2 nice things. Firstly I appreciated that the Malina wasn’t just a snarky stabby rinse and repeat FMC. She’s definitely snippy but I wouldn’t quite put her into the 100% insufferable category. Secondly I liked that the author picked Ancient Rome as her setting inspiration because finallyyyy the girlies get to have their romance empire moment. Nice! Now for… everything else. At the end of the day I don’t think I was ever going to jive with a colonizer/slave master x slave romance. For this story to even remotely work it would have to be handled with such nuance. Firebird doesn’t have that. The power imbalance between them was so icky that I found myself closing my eyes in dread at scenes leading up to intimacy because I was like “no pleaseee don’t do anything until you both are actual equals.” That’s just not a pleasant way to experience romantic progression.This issue was also exacerbated by the fact that the love interest Julianus is a dragon. The dragon within him (and also just straight up the man) often says things like “you are mine” “tell me you’re giving yourself to me” “my treasure” “say you are mine” etc. I understand these are romantasy cash lines and while I’m not even a big fan of them in the base case, given the context, they were so uncomfortable to read. I’ll also say that since this is a romance you know the love interest is going to be redeemed and has his reasons etc etc. but I just didn’t buy it? I don’t care why he conquered and murdered all her people, I care that he did it in the first place. Let’s move on from the romance. Let’s talk about world building/ setting. This is a Romantasy pitched as From Blood & Ash meets House of the Dragon. Unfortunately the only similarity between Cross’s Roman inspired setting to George R.R. Martin’s Westeros (besides the existence of dragons) was gratuitous violence towards woman. If you are hoping this story will have complex political maneuvering and characters with depth, look elsewhere. The politics is so surface level I couldn’t even submerge my pinky in it. Plus the presence of dragons just felt like an excuse for insta love, mating bonds, and “inexplicable connections” between two people to exist. Humor me, let’s come back to the romance itself for a second. APART from the ickiness in the context between them, the actual interactions between Malina and Julianus made me feel nothing. Their dynamic was just canned romantasy lines, attraction without substance, and cringe spicy scenes. I know that’s pretty subjective but words like nub, quim, and cunny were present. No thank uuuAlright wrapping up this rant. I’ll admit I read this book up until the 60-70% mark before I truly started skimming it. That is LATE in the game for a dnf and skim. I stuck with it for that long only because I was genuinely curious how the author was going to navigate the power imbalance between them romantically, not because I cared about the characters, the romance, or the world stakes. I leave you with a quote from early on, when our guy Julianus turns into a dragon on site when he sees his girl being attacked: “Treasure. Slicing into the world, I roar. The gray half-man shakes with fear. As he should. He is no dragon. Nor man. He is a vile creature who planned to defile my treasure. He must bleed. He must die.”Literally: rawr XD",colonizer/oppressed romance is now a thing guys.,"DNF.I posted a TT saying how excited I was to read this and my mind changed. I was so excited for this one, it started off strong especially when I saw Romanian language being used (because I’m half Romanian), but I got to the part where she ends up being his slave and he’s the master and it rubbed me wrong but then the rubbing got worse when I read a child wearing a slave collar. I just didn’t like that. And then I skipped ahead to see if he redeems himself in any way (which I’m not sure if he does because I couldn’t read the rest) but I read a spicy scene and he called her lady parts down there “cunny”. Nope. No thank you.Again, I was SO excited for this one, but these were things that just rubbed me wrong and were not for me at all. So I will not be continuing this book unfortunately.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an early copy, I am super appreciative."

I'll answer what I can!!Enjoy!--Thank you for reading Where Shadows Meet, the first in a romantic fantasy duology featuring vampires, humans, and the gods that created them both. Fantasy and romance have, at many times, provided me with a much-needed escape as well as validation and catharsis. As such, it was important to me for my characters to reflect the world I’ve lived in and the things I’ve lived through—the struggles, joys, and everything in between. Please know that this story contains depictions of blood (including the drinking of blood), death (including that of multiple family members), kidnapping, psychological abuse, murder, systems of oppression (pulling from my family’s history in the American South and the use of enslaved Black people as disposable labor but of course unfortunately relating to many different people across the world), and violence of all sorts. There’s also a character who has self-harmed and the showing of, and reference to, those scars. The actual self-harm occurred years prior and is not depicted.It’s my hope that I’ve treated all this with care. Enjoy this book of my heart.Sincerely,Patrice","Angels, vampires, and mortals are fighting for love in this debut Black sapphic vampire YA fantasy!

The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery,Clarence A. Haynes,4.22,"3.25 stars - thank you netgalley for an early ebook copy of this book in exchange for my honest feedback Video review: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2wCe9TQ/Publishes June 17. It follows a publicist named Gwendolyn who has a long buried secret that seems to be coming to light when a strange incident occurs at an event she’s hosting. Meanwhile a queer psychic named Fonsi is in a messy love triangle and his world is upended when he must deliver a message to Gwendolyn from the spirt realm.This book was giving ghost busters but make it diverse and glamorous. It’s camp - just absurdity riddled throughout, moments of ridiculous humor within a story of warding off spirits in New York. I think the tone of this book was a pretty good mix of lighthearted satire and serious undertones and the characters had spunk and heart which I really appreciated.A unique, albeit cheesy at times fun read.","Thank you to Grand Central Publishing and Netgalley for the early copy. All opinions are my own.Things take an unexpected turn for celebrity publicist Gwendolyn Montgomery when her events start being targeted and her past threatens to come forward .

During a premier event for her most famous clients, Clive Sergeant, and LaMarque Fashion, her worst fear comes true: red everywhere with a message scrawled in blood, on the back wall of the runway: Traidora!

It did start off a little slow but picked up quick and had me turning pages in the middle of the night. The storyline kept me intrigued as new characters and plot twists were introduced along the way. Somewhat of a “coming to terms” with the past, learning, growing, and healing along the way. Everything fit together; vivid images in my mind of El Intermedio, the museum show, Fonsi and his “ghost”, and the star protagonist, Gwendolyn Montgomery. Well written to send your mind into other worldly imagination.

Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon,"Mizuki Tsujimura, Yuki Tejima (Translator)",3.94,"Grief is such a heavy feeling. You never get rid of it. Once you’ve lost someone, you carry their absence with you, but you also carry the unasked questions, the things you never got to say or do with them, and the goodbyes that were stolen from you. Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon is a book for those of us who know what it feels like to have lost someone. What if you could meet that person you lost one more time? Would you do it?Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon is the first instalment of The Go-Between series. The go-between is a person who has a gift and can arrange for you to meet a deceased individual. The only rules are that, when you are alive, you only get to meet one dead person. And when you are dead, you can only accept to see one person. The deceased person has to accept meeting you and you can only meet them one night while the full moon is out.The book is told in five episodes. Each episode follows different characters who seek the go-between to speak with someone who has passed away. We learn about their background leading to losing the person and why they’d want to see them again (i.e., what is left unsaid/questions to ask), how they find and meet the go-between, and the day they meet their loved one. I adored the first, fourth (I’ll be forever crying about Kirari and Tsuchiya), and fifth stories. I was crying non-stop in the last 100 pages, the book made me so emotional. And it was strange because I did not care for the second and third stories, but the ending of both had me IN TEARS. It was such an emotional rollercoaster of a book. The episodes were just so easy to read and it was so easy to empathize with the characters. The last chapter was so satisfying because we got answers about who the kid is, how the go-between business works, and a beautiful reflection of the whole thing (meeting with the dead).I’m going to keep this review short. This is a great book for book clubs and just as therapy. I think the reflection at the end about how important it is for us, the living, to feel the dead watching us was beautiful. I just felt it was all very touching. Again, as someone who has said a thousand times that I’d give anything I had to see my grandma again, this book just broke me. It felt like a warm hug. I just wish the go-between was real. I can’t wait for the next book. (PS: I think I liked this more than Lonely Castle in the Mirror.)Bits I highlighted: “Being a witness to a person’s pain isn’t something you can do half-heartedly.”–– “Don’t think about coming over here yet. It’s super dark.”–– “...I still somehow believed I would make it out OK. I thought, there's no way I’m gonna die. (spoilers removed)... life is going to be so good from now on. Only good things would happen to us. I wasn't scared. I couldn’t breath, but I felt good. I knew you would be with me when I woke up.”","Contemplative and thought-provoking, the stories of the Go Between and the people he meets linger with you.3.75 stars🌕 Japanese Translated Fiction🌕 Contemporary/ Literary Fiction🌕 Contemplative🌕 Grief, love, life, and loss🌕 From the author of Lonely Castle in the Mirror""I bring together the living and the departed,"" he said in a solemn voice, enunciating his words. ""I am the go-between."" The first half of The Go Between felt like a collection of interconnected short stories; by turns emotive, loving, devastating and even dark. I felt the pace lagged at times in this part, before picking up again. For me, it really came into its own halfway through when it changed into more of a novel format. I loved the relationship between Ayumi and his grandmother.","""When a life was lost, who did it belong to? What were those left behind meant to do with the incomprehensible, inescapable loss?""Is it selfish wanting to reunite with a loved one whose life has ended while ours continues? In the midst of reading this book, I encounter this curious question. Such a thing never crossed my mind; perhaps I was too occupied with myself, wallowing in my own sorrow instead of considering the deceased's feelings. I have always been so hung up about my loss, not once stopping to think that my longing to keep them by my side for the longest time may disrupt their acceptance that their lives are no longer. They might have already moved on, at peace in the afterlife, and here I am, all miserable due to my incapability to embrace change. Through this book, I get the answer to the that question.I was pleasantly surprised by this author's ideas and perception of things when I discovered Lonely Castle in the Mirror in the beginning of the previous year, and I was eager to see what other things Mizuki Tsujimura has in store for us, the readers. Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon has successfully replaced Lonely Castle in the Mirror as my all-time favorite book.This is an interesting take about grief. I really love the concept and how the go-between doesn't take money as a means of payment. Can't wait for others to discover this masterpiece as well. The translation sometimes comes off a bit awkward, but nothing I will hold against the beauty of the book itself.Thank you Random House UK for the ARC in exchange of honest review!------Got approved for this ARC, I'm so very excited! RTC."
Hand of the Sun,Michael D. Hill Jr.,4.00,NA,NA,NA
The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,Suzanne Collins,3.99,"For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,  I loved it shamelessly,  warts and all .And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe (I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty? 
I think this book will alienate quite a few of Hunger Games fans. You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. But The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become. You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here (or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes). I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But he has some humanity in him - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice. The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it. He chooses complicity — and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey. 
 “So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”
 
This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.
 “We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”
It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it only as far as it suits his comfort. Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.
 “His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”
No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can reread The Hunger Games trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.
“He knew this would be easier if he wasn’t such an exceptional person. The best and the brightest humanity had to offer.”
——————Also posted on my blog.","I feel absolutely drained by this book. Because I was such a big fan of The Hunger Games trilogy, I was determined to finish The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, but doing so took a LOT out of me. What a chore this book was! I now understand the disappointed and outraged reviews of others who read it first, but what I don't understand is how those people were still able to blast through this in a day or two. You guys are far tougher readers than I am.I have to confess that I was initially enthusiastic about this book being told from Coriolanus Snow's perspective. I know it put some people off, but one of the few things I love more than a good villain is a good villain origin story. No, I didn't expect to sympathise with him, but could I understand how he'd gotten so messed up and evil? Well, maybe. But... I don't think it works. For so many reasons, but a major one for me is that this book is so boring. So meandering, unfocused, dry. There's a lack of urgency and emotion. A lack of any connection with the characters outside of Snow, who is so self-serving and self-pitying that I couldn't even have fun hating him. I could not understand what we were reading for. I had no real questions that needed answering. This book added nothing to the Panem universe.And the ""romance"" was just downright unpleasant.The plot takes us back to the 10th Hunger Games, where Coriolanus Snow is assigned as the mentor to the district 12 candidate, Lucy Gray (whose songs are the one shining light in this novel). Coriolanus sees this as an opportunity to shake himself free of the hardships of the past and improve his social status. Lucy's potential victory becomes deeply-entwined with Coriolanus's own, and their relationship is a discomfiting mix of romantic feelings and him using her to achieve his own means.But, still, while this is unpleasant, I don't think I am half as bothered by it as I am by how utterly dull the story is. I'm not so refined as to be above some trashy drama, but that's the thing: it's not dramatic. It's lifeless and cold. 90% of the plot exists inside Snow's head. He tells us about the supposed hardships he has had to endure, but we never really feel them. And something about his perspective makes every other character he encounters seem dull also. A few others noted that this book picks up at the end, which is possibly the only thing that carried me through. It does, but I can also say it was far too little and far too late for me. I think the only good thing about my lack of connection with this book is that I can safely say I don't even consider this part of the same universe as the original trilogy. I can now go forget about it.Facebook | Instagram","Only last 20 pages of this book managed to stir my interest. So, is this 1 or 2 stars? If I hate read the rest of it? Okay, I'll be generous. 1.5 stars it is, but there is no way I am rounding this up.The problem with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is that it doesn't know what it wants to be until the very, very end. It meanders here and there, bloated, unfocused, wordy, boring, misguided, treading the same water on and on and on, to the point of tedium. Just to get to the climax where Snow needs to decide if he wants to be good and poor and in love or bad and successful. I kept waiting for some grand twist or revelation to happen. What I got was a tiny splash of excitement after 500 of uninspired blah.There are failures of every type in this novel. Snow's evolution is convoluted, drawn out, poorly paced, and entirely too much time is spent on lingering on his sob stories of poverty, school demerits and cabbage soup. His inner world is neither explained well nor is it interesting. This is not a successful villain origin tale. You will never convince me that it is. Too many new characters are introduced, but none of them are memorable. There is not one person of Haymitch's caliber, or Cinna’s, or Effie's. There is an attempt to show the dawn and messiness of the early Hunger Games, with all the gore and DYI-horror, but it's diluted by the wrong perspective, weird Capitol apologia and a BIG BAD, super-boring first game maker villain. There is a romance that it totally unbelievable and an incomprehensible joke. I literally spent 99% of this book with this expression on my face. (I wish I were exaggerating.) None of what was happening made any sense, especially the romance (gag). I do believe there is a decent story somewhere in this mess of bloated mediocrity, a story that should have been told by Lucy maybe? But as is, this is a massive failure of execution. The pacing is off, the themes are muddled, there is no passion, there is no urgency, there is no heart, there are no stakes. There is, of course, Lucy who was badly underserved. And her songs (too many?). Two potential positives totally wasted on this travesty of a novel. I am not touching this book ever again, and I am going to try to forget it ever existed. A heartbreaking fiasco. ____________Not sure I liked this excerpt or the idea of redeeming a monster. Still, hope dies last... https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/w...____________Never expected this one to happen..."
Once Upon a Broken Heart,Stephanie Garber,4.06,"To put it simply, Once Upon a Broken Heart is a hot mess. The premise promises a fairytale, but what Garber delivers is a confused nightmare. With an annoyingly-naïve protagonist, a one-dimensional cast of supporting characters and a truly “what the fuck”-inducing plot, this book’s only saving graces are the short chapters and fast pacing, which at times can too be a hindrance to your enjoyment and desire to rate this book higher than you actually will.The beginning chapters of this book are the only thing that delivers on the premise. With vivid imagery, they instantly drew me in and I could see the improvement in Garber’s writing from the six (boring) chapters I had read of Caraval. (As you can guess, that didn’t last very long). Once Upon a Broken Heart follows rose gold-haired Evangeline Fox, whose stepsister is set to marry Luc, her one true love. Believing Luc to be cursed and desperate to stop the wedding, she enlists the help of Jacks, a Fate and the Prince of Hearts. He agrees to do so under the condition that Evangeline will kiss 3 people of his choosing, but doesn’t say any more than that. Willing to do whatever it takes to stop Luc marrying Marisol, she agrees to the deal but the wedding is stopped by Jacks turning everyone to stone. It is here that Evangeline first displays her wishy-washy personality, as she regrets her actions and drinks the poison that turned the bride, groom and wedding guests to stone – thereby taking their place. Evangeline, as a protagonist and narrator, frustrated me endlessly. She’s insanely naïve, always trusting people she shouldn’t and wanting to help Marisol (her stepsister) when it’s very obvious that a) her sister is shady and up to no good and b) she generally has no reason to. The two of them have next to no relationship, but because Evangeline is so Wonderful and Perfect and Special Because She Has Pink Hair, of course she has to want to help. She’s also a very passive character: things happen to her, not because of her. Now, I know what you’re probably thinking: “Characters are allowed to be naïve! It’s part of their growth!” or “Characters are allowed to be nice! They don’t all have to be sword-wielding assassins or (insert other character trope here)”. Trust me, I hear you, but there’s a difference between those characters and Evangeline Fox. The side characters – yes, including Jacks – in this book are no better. They’re all one-dimensional and flat, having one ‘unique’ aspect about them… and that’s it. I could tell you hardly anything about them. Jacks’ past with Donatella is briefly mentioned, but I wouldn’t really class that as him having personality, and I think it’s more fanservice for existing Caraval fans than anything. I can separate this book into two parts: Before Evangeline Drinks the Poison and After Evangeline Drinks the Poison. I enjoyed the Before part, as After Evangeline Drinks the Poison is where Stephanie Garber seems to have forgotten the novel she promised to readers, and began writing something else entirely. Ergo, the plot had gone haywire. The book’s plot follows no clear structure; it’s all over the place. Sure, there’s a little bit of “action” but that does nothing to redeem a story that is 99% Boring and 1% Interesting Scenes. There were numerous attempts at romantic scenes throughout the book, but Evangeline has no real chemistry with either of her potential love interests (one of them is literally cursed to be in love with her, so there’s that), so it did nothing for me and I skim-read most of them.Once Upon a Broken Heart took an extremely bizarre turn after the introduction of vampires. Yes, you read that correctly. Vampires. What the fuck are vampires doing in this book? It was so completely and utterly random, I was honestly thinking ‘what was Stephanie Garber on when she wrote this?’ while reading. We were given no real explanation as to why vampires were included either. It was like a complete abuse of authorial power on Garber’s part: she thought vampires were cool, so she just put them in the book, with no real thought as to the sense (or lack thereof) it would make. And trust me, it made zero sense. Unfortunately, around the last third of the book and its “plot” hinges on vampires, so there wasn’t any escaping them.There was also a prophecy subplot, because of course there was. The prophecy in this book centres around the Valory Arch, a mysterious archway in The North which contains either treasure and secrets or deadly monsters (no one is really sure which). Evangeline, having such Main Character Energy, is the key to unlocking this arch/doorway (I get she literally IS the main character, but just roll with the punches here). I say it’s a subplot, but I honestly couldn’t tell you what was the main plot and what were subplots in this book. Garber weaved a lot of threads throughout Once Upon a Broken Heart, and they got tangled up at times. As a ‘minor’ complaint, a lot is told to readers and not shown. For instance, after Evangeline has just woken up from being poisoned, she is told of a Week of Terrors that unfolded after the cancelled wedding, but we’re not given any information about it. Later, through dialogue, Evangeline learns of information she needs to know to progress the plot, but it’s done in quite a heavy-handed manner. There’s a lot of it, and wasn’t done subtlety or in small pieces, like you might see elsewhere in other novels. To give myself something positive to say about this book, I did like its short chapters and relatively fast pacing. As a slow reader, I appreciated being able to get through this book super quickly. Yes, that’s all I have to say. Moving on!The book ends on a cliffhanger. It’s somewhat intriguing, but I certainly won’t be reading the sequel. If for whatever reason, after reading this review, you’re still inclined to read Once Upon a Broken Heart, you might want to hold off on doing so until the sequel is out, as this will leave you with too many loose plot threads and unanswered questions – more than any book should.Thank you to Kate Keehan and Hodder & Stoughton for the eARC! ↠ 1 starBookstagram ✦ BookTwitter ✦ BookTok15/04/2024: I'm far too late in adding this, but if you're looking for a YA fantasy series (with enemies to lovers, morally grey characters, and corruption arcs) that will actually be worth your time, may I direct your attention to The Kinder Poison by Natalie Mae!","4 starsThis is one of the most interesting worlds I've encountered in fantasy books.

❝For anyone who has ever made a bad decision because of a broken heart.❞
This dedication is enough to make you want to read this book! I LOVE IT AND NEXT BIO IS GONNA BE THIS ONE! 🙌🏻😭• Evangeline went to the Prince of Heart's church thinking that her prayer might be answered by Fate – prince of Hearts – and the wedding of her lover would be stopped. Desperate and heartbroken enough, she made a deal with fate to stop her lover's wedding in exchange for three kisses with people he choose.The Prince of Hearts has such a certain vibe! His kiss is deadly, his heart doesn't beat, and the most important – he's heartbroken and is cursed to never find love, which gives Eva hopes that he might help her. Their first interaction was so funny, and I was getting second-hand embarrassments from her behalf! I didn't expect Jacks to be such a meanie! 😭 
❝People who don’t like me call me Jacks.❞
Jacks – he's the cursed prince of hearts who's a manipulator, a toxic person who'll do anything to gain what he wants, and cocky. BUT WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE SO HOT AND PERFECT? It'll always be the villain and never the hero besides.... the hero never gets a happy ending! 🤭 The hype for him is real, and I see myself falling in love with him, just like I did with Aaron Warner 😮‍💨I'm literally a simp for him atp! Him doing mundane things like tossing the apple, slicing the apple, BITING THE APPLE had me swooning! ANDDDD HE HADDDD NOOO RIGHT TO BE SOOOO HOT IN THIS SCENEEE!!!!! 👇🏻❝What am I supposed to do with this [dagger]?❞❝You might want to use it, Little Fox.❞ The corner of his mouth twitched as he slowly slid his pale hands through the bars of the gate and broke the lock in half. It could have been a twig, a piece of paper, or her.Evangeline Fox — she's just a naive girl with a hopeless romantic personality, and well, she's quite delusional but would call herself hopeful! She has been surrounded by so many fairy tales that she just wants her life to be like it. She's smack-dabbed in the face with the realities, but she'd rather create alternatives to not tarnish the image of people she cares about. I actually liked her selflessness and her acceptance of her BAD DECISION. But there's nothing much interesting to her character besides this. Not a huntress or amazing at fighting too lmao. So far, she's a hopeless romantic who's kind of attracted to Jacks because he's a baddie but doesn't want to die either by kissing him. Enemies to lovers — their dynamic is so good? Evangeline has hot and cold feelings for him. She's torn between wanting to kiss him or hate him. Jacks being absolutely mean with her one moment and saying things HE SHOULDN'T the next moment were too much to handle and him calling her LITTLE FOX 💞🤭 ❝Do you want to be a vampire?❞❝No,❞ Jacks spat. ❝I don’t want to be a vampire, but I do want to bite you.❞SIR????? 😮‍💨🧎‍♀️🥵😭❝You might not like me, but I bet you’d like it if I kissed you.❞Jacks... wdym IT WAS ENTERTAINING TO SEE HER KISS APOLLO AND THAT OLD LADY FORTUNA ??? 😭 That was really unnecessary, but he just wanted to toy with Eva by making her kiss them! He outright accepted that he manipulated her. He's actually evil in this book regardless of his past, and he threatened her subtly that she'd die if she didn't agree with her part of the bargain. I'm all but patient for his character development and just to see his softie side, after all, a glimpse of it when he carried her through the cold just to take her to get a cure for the poison she got and let her sleep in his arms the whole night , was just 😭💞❝You could have unlocked me as well❞ — I was wondering if Jacks had indulged her and struck a deal with her in the first place because she opened the church's door. It's known she can open Valory Arch, but maybe that was the time when Jacks realized that she's the rose-gold haired girl who's the one who can open the arch. and he didn't know her before.Apollo being in love was so funny! I only liked that scene where they were talking and he was being nice, but otherwise, he was really quick to dismiss Eva in the first place, and Marisol is just a bitch! I just knew something was sus about her since the start because no one is too kind, and she's after all her mother's child, and yep she definitely stole Luc. I knew Jacks is evil! I do love him, but he's so manipulative, and the ending actually shocked me! I still hate Marisol because she's a bitch, but damn the way Jacks went through so much just to frame her and wrongly accused Eva just to get the prophecy right 😮‍💨🤚🏻 and yeahhh 4 stars just because, it had wayy too much info dumps! I actually enjoyed most of the book but there were sometimes long ass paragraphs just about NORTH. and Ummmm CHAOS SHOULD GET HIS OWN BOOK PLS + with Lala would be great! •  The Ballad Of Never After – 3.75 stars•  A Curse For True Love – 3 stars","Hi friends! Update, April 15: If you've been waiting for a signed US edition, Barnes and Noble has just announced their exclusive edition--it has bonus material, a secret cover printed on the hardcover case, and it's PINK! Update, March 11: I'm so excited to share that Once Upon A Broken Heart has a US cover! It was revealed today Frolic, along with an interview and a sneak peek of the prologue. Here's a link:https://frolic.media/exclusive-once-u...I hope you all love the cover as much as I do! P.S. The UK will have a separate and very different cover, which will be revealed at a later date. xoI'm so excited to share that Once Upon a Broken Heart has a full description:The first book in a new series about love, curses, and the lengths that people will go to for happily ever after.  Evangeline Fox was raised in her beloved father’s curiosity shop, where she grew up on legends about immortals, like the tragic Prince of Hearts. She knows his powers are mythic, his kiss is worth dying for, and that bargains with him rarely end well. But when Evangeline learns that the love of her life is about to marry another, she becomes desperate enough to offer the Prince of Hearts whatever he wants in exchange for his help to stop the wedding. The prince only asks for three kisses. But after Evangeline’s first promised kiss, she learns that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she’d pledged. And he has plans for Evangeline that will either end in the greatest happily ever after, or the most exquisite tragedy… That's all for now, but I can't wait to share more soon! xo"
Heartless Hunter,Kristen Ciccarelli,4.19,"That ending😭😭💔 Been crying for hours now, so if this review comes across as messy- it's cause of that. ✔️ Witches + witch hunters✔️ Enemies to lovers ✔️ Love triangle (resolves by the end) ✔️ Forbidden magic✔️ Morally grey charactersIt's mostly  a character driven story  and is quite fast paced. The world building is minimal but as I draft this review I realised I was so mesmerized by the story I didn't even care for the world build. The main characters- Rune, Gideon and Alex are not perfect, have their flaws and tragic backstories but their dynamic is so perfect with each other.  Rune  kinda disappointed me which is why it's not a perfect read for me. Given her reputation as the Crimson Moth, I was expecting her to be more badass, fierce and hands on action. But she came across as just a girl stuck in a love triangle, a damsel in distress who needed rescuing by the two brothers. I did like her personality but she did not live up to her reputation.  Gideon  the witch hunter, had me blushing, giggling and kicking my feet. I loved his confidence, his flirting, and how much he cared for Rune and Alex. His trauma and the loss of everyone in his life, gave his character depth.  Alex,  Gideon's brother and Rune's friend was the sweetest. I loved the lengths he went to protect Rune and how much he loved her. Alex, although flawed was the purest character in this book.The romance  is pretty swoon-worthy. I was torn between Gideon and Alex throughout the book. Both of these guys are so different but so deserving. Their genuine affections for Rune was nice to see. I personally do not mind love triangles, so it wasn't much of an issue. But if you are looking forward to reading this book and worried about it- the issue gets resolved by the end of this book. There are a lot of sweet and heartbreaking moments, so don't miss out 👀 The ending...  Bro don't make me talk about that 😭😭 It's gonna take few days to recover. But I will say, the plot twist regarding Verity did not surprise me as I was suspecting her already. But the other stuff 😭😭😭 I can't wait for the next book. If you are looking for a simplistic, easy to get lost in romantasy, this is the one for you. Do give it a go 🥰Thanks to my girl Gillian for reading this with me, had a great time with you babes 💜","three 5 stars in a row feels crazy!! But the last 3 books I read have truly been some of my fav reads this year. I LOVED this book! This book could not be more my taste - its enemies to lovers (witch & witch hunter), cunning FMC, morally grey MMC, forbidden romance, & fake dating ish. The characters both pretend to be dating each other to get information from each other & I thought that plot concept was SO cool and unique. They're both hunting & being hunted by each other. It was like a steamy game of cat and mouse.PLUS THEIR BANTER AND CHEMISTRY was great!! I'm in love with Gideon. It's also set in high society in a fantasy world which made for great outfits & settings. And THE ENDING! I need book 2 asap","i loved this! like, whole-heartedly loved this.it reminded me of my reading experiences with ‘blood and moonlight,’ ‘serpent and dove,’ and ‘small favors.’ not because the plots are similar (theyre not), but because i was so effortlessly submerged in the stories. the characters are fully developed, the plot is engaging, the writing is spot-on, and the overall vibe is entertaining. its just a high-quality novel in all the ways that matter to me as a reader. so this is an easy book to recommend!↠ 4.5 stars"
The Ballad of Never After,Stephanie Garber,4.50,"I am here for my wicked boy. “Where were you?” she asked.“I was killing innocent maidens and kicking puppies.”“Jacks, that’s not funny.” Actually it is very funny and adorable. Well, not the puppy kicking, I am thoroughly against that but the teasing in this book is off the charts. And the chemistry is off off the charts.“In the morning, you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don't like me, and I can pretend that I don't care. But for tonight, let me pretend you're mine.” Awww, my girlish side is melting. Honestly, I don't even think I can write a coherent review on this book or if I need to, really. I just want to fangirl and gash over Jacks. But here I have to make a disclaimer that though I am forever team Jacks I couldn't help but notice the amount of sexy men in this book! Really, so many yummy abs! Apart from the hotness I once again enjoyed the fairytale vibe, I love Stephanie Garber's writing and how she described North with its magic and mysteries. So enchanting! Beautiful writing.But let's get a little bit distracted from men in this book and say a couple of words about women. To be honest, I wish there were more female characters I would want to root for or know more about. Evangeline though was very nice and I found I wasn't annoyed by her inner voice as this book is from her POV and more often than not female characters get on my nerves. Evangeline was an easygoing character whose adventure I enjoyed following along with her.All in all, I can't really empathize how much i want to get my hands on book 3. Time machine? A band of street thieves to steal the draft of the manuscript? Deal with Fae for the next installment in exchange for my firstborn? You name it. I'd agreed to anything if I had the opportunity to read that book now. But I am mentally preparing to suffer for another year. Meanwhile I'll just keep re-reading those sexy moments with Jacks. “You know, biting is really like kissing but better, if you do it right.”","➸ 5 stars 

”i wish our story could have had another ending”

— stephanie garber, WHAT IF I WAS SUICIDAL. WHAT IF THAT WAS MY LAST STRAW. how am i supposed to live, laugh, love in these conditions—that ending was just rude. all that angst, sexual tension, JEALOUSY, hurting, THE PUSH AND PULL BETWEEN THEM, would kill anyone for her, the denial of their love for each other but it’s obvious that they’re each others one true love, JUST TO GIVE THEM THAT ENDING?!! FOR WHAT?? NOTHING 😭i have been left a hollow shell of pain and longing and i will never recover from that. my chest hurts, my heart is aching, the end is near. i feel like screaming the way regina george did in that one scene!! 

”but for tonight, let me pretend you're mine""

currently still crying over evajacks rn, im afraid i’ll never be able to recover from them and this fkn book. they are my mf babies and i’ll protect them with my LIFE.
“there is nothing of equal value to me”
 LIVES WERE CHANGED, JACKS YOU WERE INSANE FOR THAT.

”do you still think of me as just a tool?” jacks frowned. “i try not to think of you at all.”

STEPHANIE PLS FREE MY FAMILY. evajacks are my soul, my family, my everything. they birthed me, raised me, breathed life into me, drove me to school, fed me, stuck my artwork on the fridge, read me bedtime stories, sent me to college, walked me down the aisle and transformed me into the person i am today. no one gets them like i do.i thought the reread would hurt less.. boy was i wrong. this book is going to haunt me for the rest of my life!!","— arc review: 5 stars ✰
""but jacks didn't stop following her,and she had a feeling he never would""
you have got to be kidding me. oh my god, stop. i am sobbing. i swear this isn’t funny. i need a third book, right here, right now. there is absolutely no way that i can wait another year for the next releasei have a lot to say about this book. first off, i wanted to take my sweet sweet time with this one. i‘ve been waiting for so long and i refused to read it in one day. but you all know how consuming this world is, it’s so magical that it is nearly impossible to stop to read. and well, i did read it in one day and i miss this universe alreadylet me tell you.. the banter, teasing and taunting in this book?? extraordinary. i love jacks sarcasm, even eva adapted it. his dimples, oh my god his dimples. also, let’s not forget the fact that he calls her little fox. once eva doesn’t pay him enough attention, he for sure chimes in to get it back. and i‘m so here for it. my sweet wicked jacks. the way he is so protective over her 😭😭😭
""i do not want you dead, and i'll kill anyone who tries""
the plot is just amazing. i am just so in love with the whole universe, i was hooked since the beginning, i can’t even describe in words how badly i want to read the next one to know what will happen next. the ending really broke my heart and i swear if stephanie doesn’t put the pieces back together i will sue. i love eva with my whole heart and i really hope that we will see more of her badass side in the future. before reading this book, prepare for emotional damage! chapter 46 will break you.he called her love one time 😭 and there’s also a ""he‘s injured and she helps him"" trope with ""please stay here tonight""
""in the morning, you can forget it. you can go back to pretending you don't like me, and i can pretend that i don’t care. but for tonight, let me pretend you're mine""

A Curse for True Love,Stephanie Garber,4.15,"“I am a monster, but whether you remember it or not, I’m your monster, Evangeline.”
  y'allll when I tell you this line made me- ALEXA PLAY LITERALLY ANY LOVE SONG BY TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE EVAJACKS ARE EVERYTHING AND SO IS TAYLOR SWIFT.(there will be spoilers if you haven't read this book so be wary!)Ok so here we finally are. The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don't even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It's gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it's not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I'll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo's first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke: “He'd never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks's chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let's just say, that's definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let's just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that's true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I'm pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it's cute, because it wasn't, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won't be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I'm still bitter that Tella didn't pop up in a cameo. I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I've already written so much so here's my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much was because of the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she's a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn't as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won't get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I'm messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts's mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don't end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼‍♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don't matter or aren't important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks's story is so good, I can't even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I'm all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn't paying much attention, sooo when I'm less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I'm ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars

I'm going to die when this comes out. I'm already preparing myself for a death or sad ending, because I know there is going to be some sort of heartbreaking and I'm going to cry EDIT: THE COVER IS HERE OH MY GOD. Honestly unsure how I feel about it....like the title placement looks odd, but I do like the idea and concept of the tree.""Two villains do battle for the heart of one girl"" and the winner BETTER BE JACKSEdit: A CURSE FOR TRUE LOVE???

I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG, WE ALL DESERVE THIS AFTER THE END OF TBONA*sobs violently into a pillow* After the heartbreak that The Ballad of Never After did to me, I NEED EVAJACKS ENDGAME PLEASE ISTG IF I DON'T GET ONE I'M GOING TO RIOT(Also, I won't mind if Apollo *ahem* doesn't make it out of this book alive. Just saying)","“he wasn’t hers to think about, and yet she kept picturing the way he’d looked in the hall, and how for a second, he’d seemed almost shy, almost scared, and almost hers”

me the second i saw jacks’ pov in chapter 11:what a stunning conclusion to this magical, whimsical series!!THIS BOOK WILL NEVER TOP TBONA, BUT IT WAS STILL SO PERFECT TO ME. WE GOT JACKS' POV AND SO MANY SCENES HAD ME GOING FERAL. MY HEART IS SO FULL AND I FEEL SO CONTENT RN!! EVAJACKS YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS AND LOVED BY ME. there has been no other characters who have made me feel so much before. no one does angst, longing, pining and yearning better than evajacks.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BREATHE, BREATHE? how am i supposed to move on, the evajacks brainrot is crippling. i will never be able to move on from them i fear, they mean so much to me!! ❤️‍🩹BUT OMG IM SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL RN. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? I HATE THAT WE’VE REACHED THE END OF THEIR STORY, GIVE ME 10 MORE BOOKS PLS AND THANK U. EVAJACKS INVENTED ROMANCE. this book was everything n more. i loved how it was clearly made that it was always going to be eva for jacks and when he closed his eyes all he ever saw was her!! like how jacks kept the letter eva wrote to herself abt him close to his heart even tho it wasn't romantic?? jacks' happy place being when he was at the hollow with eva?? the way jacks couldn't physically stay away from eva?? how he constantly tucks her hair behind her ear?? pls his love language is physical touch. the continuous pining between eva and jacks?? the way they kept fighting for each other?? one bed?? the sexual tension in that one scene?? my turn / my turn again the bantering?? the love and admiration they have for another?? ACTUALLY THEY DIDN'T INVENT ROMANCE, THEY PERFECTED IT!!

“he would have set the world on fire and then let it all burn just to keep holding her like this.”

spoiler— i needed so much more tho, i feel satisfied but to an extent i feel like so many things were missing and idk how to feel about the ending. i still have so many unanswered questions - like what happened to the third broken heart scar? where was my silly lil vampire boy luc? i need to know what kind of ending he had. the apple theory? it was open ended. what happened to marisol? she wasn't even mentioned lmao. how did jacks become a fate? everything ended so abruptly and it did weaken the story. i wanted MORE jacks, everything was subdued by apollo.. no but honestly, WHY WAS there so much apollo (gag) he was taking the main focus off of evajacks and he was ruining my buzz. i needed more relationship development, we didn’t get enough evajacks content imo. i can literally count on my hands the scenes we got of them.. we needed more fluff, more cuddles, more kisses and evajacks domestic scenes at the hollow. like why is life so unfair?? WE WERE ROBBED OUT OF SO MANY DETAILS. i never ask for much, that is all i ever wanted 🥲 stephanie garber PLS give us an evajacks novella that is just fluffy w domestic scenes. 

“i’d rather go up in flames with him than watch while he burns.”

This was good but maybe my expectations were too high because it wasn't as good as I expected. The Ballad of Never After was much better than this. But still, I enjoyed this a lot. This was just as engrossing as the previous books but it lacked the magic and hopefulness of previous books. There wasn't much plot. Also, why did the characters just disappear? Where is Luc? Where is Marisol? Are they alive? Are they dead? Jacks and Eva's scenes were good. But strangely enough, I feel like there weren't enough of them. They had much more interactions in the previous books. I expected more scenes. Apollo just ruins everything. He's such a one-dimensional character. Even after reading his POV, I couldn't connect with his character at all. He was sooo boring.This also felt quite underwhelming and rushed. I don't know, there was just something off about it.I thought it would be difficult to get back Eva's memory. But it was so easy and it took no effort from Jacks and Eva at all. This is an issue since this is one of the main conflicts of this book. Just interacting with Jacks brought back her memories. That's it? It's that easy? After so much build-up, I expected a better first kiss between Eva and Jacks. It wasn't up to the mark. The biting scene at the end of the first book was much better than this. Jacks is also a villain, correct? So why didn't he fight for Eva? I never expected him to just give up. He always gives up and Eva has to run after him to make progress. I needed an epic love confession from Jacks but alas that did not happen. Jacks is still a Fate. Eva is still a mortal. So she'll just die while he spends his eternity mourning her? Apollo was a horrible villain. He wasn't intimidating at all. He was quite pathetic tbh. I felt like Jacks' personality completely changed in this book. Jacks used to be a very mercurial character. He could be both cruel and kind at the same time. He was also very flirtatious and charismatic. He stopped being mischievous and teasing. Like his interactions with Eva completely changed. He was more sober and honest in this book which honestly gave me a whiplash. He lacked the magnetic charisma that was so apparent in the previous books.I wanted so much more angst. I wanted to see some pining. I wanted to see some unrequited love. I wanted drama. I wanted Jacks to realise his mistakes and grovel for Eva.I wanted Jacks to change for the better, that's true, but I still wanted him to remain the same at the core. I could sometimes see flashes of the old Jacks in this book but that's it. I fell in love with the old Jacks who was a moody bastard. Also, I have to say I'm disappointed by Jacks' role in this book. He was hardly present and mostly stayed in the background. He felt like a side character. I wish we learned more about his backstory. I think Jacks' pov wasn't needed at all because it ruined the mystery and enigma of his character. It could have been good had it even been written properly.Apollo and Aurora took way too much space. That space should have been given to exploring more of Jacks and Eva's dynamic. Everything wasn't explained and some loose ends were left untied. The ending too felt rushed and anti-climactic. 1) Why does Jacks eat apples? What does the colour of the apple signify?2) How is Jacks able to talk telepathically to Eva?3) Eva still owes Jacks a third kiss according to their bargain. What about that?And so many more questions remain. I think the main reason this book felt so weak is because The Ballad of Never After was just perfect. The pacing, plot and romance were done perfectly. And reading this book has only increased my appreciation for The Ballad of Never After. Ratings-1) Once Upon a Broken Heart- 3.5/5 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...2) The Ballad of Never After- 5/5 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...3) Curse for True Love-2/5Pre-release thoughts- ""I'm your monster"". Ahhhhhhhhhhh, I'm dead. I will literally evaporate when I read this quote in the book. I was worried that there would not be a third book. Imagine my sadness and anxiety. I mean, Jacks and Eva deserved a happy ending.Anyway, I'm really excited about this. I can't wait till September! It's too far away.I need an ARC like right now.Edit- The summary and cover are here! The cover is gorgeous. All I can say is that Eva deserves better. The poor girl has suffered enough. Just let her live her life happily.Edit 2- The first 4 chapters have been released, including an Apollo pov. No sighting of Jacks."
The Chalice of the Gods,Rick Riordan,4.28,"""Sitting down is easy. Getting up, not so much.""The nostalgia is so sweet with this one. I've had a pretty tough week, and boy was it perfect timing to be able to go on an adventure with Percy Jackson again. He was my very first best friend, and the comfort I felt turning every page of this will not be forgotten. Even if it feels like Rick will never leave me alone, his words will always be something I pine after. He knows how to drive a story home!Every page of this felt like a throwback to a core memory we built together as a group of kids just wanting to go on an adventure. All of Percy's greatest hits lay before us so we could reminisce, and be reminded what it felt like to be a kid again. We're all grown up, and while Percy is still a teenager, he grew up with us, too. He's always had the sarcasm of his age and the courage to never actually act that way. With a Mom like Sally, how could he ever be anything but wise beyond his years? With Annabeth by his side, is it truly possible to be anything but special?He's never really been given a break to be a kid. Being a half blood doesn't allow you the luxury. I'm almost thankful for it after reading this book simply because he learned so much faster than anyone else that growing up is the most important thing you can do in your life. Loving people, getting to live life beside them, that's the point.Percy doesn't need anyone else to point that out for him, he knew it when the Gods gifted him immortality and he said no. But this book was a nice reminder that no matter what he does in his life, no matter how many monsters he must fight, the goal will always be to keep going with Annabeth and Grover. How sweet is that?How did he grow up so fast? How is he going to be a big brother (we knew that). How on earth is he smarter, more caring, more understanding that anyone has ever given him credit for? I love that even when he's fighting monsters, he still tries to give them the benefit of the doubt and a chance. That he deals with Gods thousands of years old, and will always give them a chance to change their ways even when they absolutely do not deserve it.He's a golden drachma if I've ever known one. I can't wait to see where his next search for a college letter will take him.","Quests, laughter, and full of nostalgia- what else can you want?!  PERCY JACKSON IS BACK BABY!! My MOST anticipated read of the year and it delivered! I read the first PJO book when I was in my early teens and I have loved this series since then. This is the series that really made me love reading. Don't get me wrong, Harry Potter was good but Percy Jackson was AMAZING 🫣 Percy will always be my first book boyfriend 🥹 Man's irreplaceable that way. I would in fact say, Percy and the other characters have been with me through almost all stages of life (given how many times I have reread it). Basically, what am saying is this series and world is special to me and getting to read it, experiencing it again was heartwarming. The stakes are not high at all in this book but the fun is still there. There is no imminent danger to the world but maybe to Percy's college applications there is. We see the OG trio unite and it's like they were never apart. Grover, Annabeth and Percy make anything fun. Some of the things they mentioned were clearly meant for nostalgic purposes  (I wish they would've included the dam joke). I loved how our Wise Girl stayed true to her character. And Grover balancing the trio's chaos in his own innocent yet chaotic way. And I especially loved our Seaweed Brain, who was full of his usual sarcasm, foolishness, ready to battle and well being himself 🥹I loved every moment of this book. I cried. I laughed. I cherished. And am not ready to let go. Rick, ffs write another 😭😭😭~•~•~HAPPY RELEASE DAY! My most anticipated read of the year and am SO EXCITEDDDD 🤩🤩~•~•~I WANT THIS. I NEED THIS. I LONG FOR THIS.

Assistant to the Villain,Hannah Nicole Maehrer,3.92,"UPDATE-  IT'S GOING TO BE A TV SERIES Y'ALL. AHHH I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE VILLAIN COME ALIVE ON SCREEN 🤭🤭~•~•~A binge-worthy entertaining read 🤩✔️ Cozy fantasy vibes ✔️ Workplace romance✔️ Dual pov✔️ Slow burn✔️ Grumpy x sunshine ✔️ Magic + mysteryTo support her ailing family, Evie Sage is desperately looking for employment and when chaos happens she is offered an assistant job to the town's most infamous man- The Villain. As she is getting used to the job, she develops a crush on him. Turns out it's not all that easy when someone's trying to sabotage your boss. The  world building  could have been better. It's quite forgettable. Am not sure where things were or what kind of town it was or the kingdoms involved? It lacked clarity and I hope the next book does it better.  The characters-  Evie and the Villain.  Evie  is so selfless and fun, her sunshine personality is not over the top and is just perfectly balanced. I liked her a lot, except when she started to crack jokes or whatever she thought qualifies as a joke. Her sense of humor wasn't that great. But I loved seeing her drool over the Villain (who wouldn't), it was adorable.  The Villain   (whose name I won't reveal cause of spoilers)  is definitely the type of guy who hates everyone but her. He is so charismatic. He's definitely a brooding guy and I adored seeing him open up to Evie. Loved how into her he was already, despite her bad jokes. One thing that could have been better about him was if he was even more villainous but I kinda get it- it's just lighthearted stuff and YA. I enjoyed the  cozy mystery vibes.  Trying to find out who is trying to sabotage the Villain was fun and totally wasn't the person I was expecting. Loved the plot twist at the end. The  romance  was cute tho it didn't really develop into something more, am expecting that to happen in the next book. I loved the pining, from both of them and how the two were always open for communication. This is a clean romance, so no spice. And it works out quite well. The way the two were always so protective of each other was everything!! The  ending  was hard to put down. Loved the plot twist at the end. As it ends on a cliffhanger, am really looking forward to the next one. Overall, a fun lighthearted read. I recommend it if you're in the mood for cozy mystery fantasy and if you want entertainment. ~•~•~Fantasy rom com? When Once Upon a Time meets The Office? Am so into that...  That's what she said  LET'S GOO","DNF at 30%Before we go any further, I need to remind you that every book I read receives the same degree of harsh scrutiny. I don't know Hannah, nor have I ever been mutuals with her. And honestly, I'm relieved for that last fact because I don't know how the hell I'd manage that conflict of interest. I promised to be 100% honest with all of you—always. No matter what. No matter how nervous it makes me that I'll receive backlash. Because at the end of the day: THIS ISN'T A PERSONAL ATTACK. It's a review of a particular piece of literature.I'm sorry I don't have anything nice to say about this book. If it makes you feel any better, I'm mutuals with Ali Hazelwood and I said her latest novel was ""seriously mediocre.""Here's why I bailed on Assistant to the Villain: 1. This book gave me the same cringe, uncomfy feeling as watching anything ChristianTok, much like the first half of this (decidedly hilarious) TikTok made by my friend Shaye.2. It reads like Middle Grade, so much so that I almost gaslit myself into thinking that maybe it was YA. Nope. It's adult. Or at least, it's supposed to be. 3. Painfully unfunny. I never saw the original TikToks that inspired this book, and I believe the marketing when it says the series was ""hilarious."" Why then, did not an ounce of humour translate? Moreover, why instead of finding it even a little bit funny, did I make this face after every joke line was delivered: 🥴😵‍💫4. Characters as flat as French crêpes. Do you really need me to explain this one? Fine. How's this: If the main character were an instrument, she'd be a cowbell. 5. Either the narrator's performance did the book zero favours, or vice versa. Either way, the narration was grating. I hope I am in the tiny minority of people who don't like this book 😬 And for the love of god, do not send this to the author. In fact, do not send ANY negative reviews to ANY authors. That just makes you a c-nt. It's not a good look. Many thanks to Tantor for providing me with the ALC and for Penguin UK for sending me an ARC",I loved the humor and writing style of this book. Such a silly goofy kick your feet and giggle humor style🤭. I've never read a book like that before.And I loved the characters! It was so fun seeing the villain's heart soften over time and seeing Evie embrace her own villainous side. And I never would've guessed the identity of the person sabotaging the villain!! My only complaint is that the middle end moved a bit slow for me.
Heat of the Everflame,Penn Cole,4.26,"More than a little disappointed in this book. Being the 3rd book in the series, I expected so much more. Let’s start with Diem. Her naivety is being stretched to the brink! Nothing is more annoying than a character who ignores every single sign every single time. But, she’s supposed to be this ultimate chosen oh so powerful character and can’t put 2 and 2 together to save her life. Her inability to listen to anything her ‘advisors’ say is also grating on my nerves. I didn’t agree with a single decision she made in this book. Where is her growth? It’s like the more powerful she gets the more reckless she becomes. When the main character is the most annoying character, it becomes a problem. I was 3 chapters in when I realized how disappointing it was that this book was told from Diem’s POV the entire time. I needed a break from her from the start! Diem and Luther. Sigh. The slow burn is burnt out!! How are these two always together but never getting anywhere? I hate that Luther went from this big bad shadow wielding prince to some little love stick puppy following Diem into the most ridiculous situations. We should not need to dumb down his character to make Diem more appealing. At this point, I almost prefer Henri cause he’d never let her get away with this non-sense. It’s so obvious that Diem and Luther are mates. That was expected in book 1 and we’re going into book 4 and it hasn’t been addressed not even once.The book overall is far too repetitive. I quit reading and started skimming somewhere around the 18th time Diem went on a ‘mortals deserve better’ rant. As the third book, we know this. We understand this. Now show us (not tell us) how this is being remediated. We know our characters and their personalities. We don’t need a reminder of who they are and what they believe in. Too much of this book is Diem’s internal thoughts!!!!! When I saw how many pages were in this book I was excited. But really, you’re rereading book 1-2 and 3 all in one. It’s too much and I started losing interest fast. I really enjoyed books 1 and 2 because I understood they were setting the stage for the plot development but this book did not meet its mark at all. Hopefully the final book is less repetitive and more plot. Thank you to the author for an arc in exchange for my honest review.","LOVED book 1 and 2, despite the fact that Diem was naive and didn’t listen.But this book? Oh, I was so bummed to read this. It was such a letdown of the storyline. First of all…. Diem is SO annoying. We get it. She’s the most compassionate being in the realm. She’s the only one who sees balance. She’s the only one who can save everyone. Then WHY for goodness’ sake, is she SO DUMB?? She’s the best healer around, but she can’t tell that Luther is dying. She is the “daughter of the forgotten”, but she can’t figure out that her father *is* the forgotten 10th sibling. She can’t listen to any good advice, flies headlong into improbable, impossible situations that could be easily avoided… all for “here’s someone you love. Do what I say or I’ll kill them” plot holes that could have been easily side stepped. Instead of earning all of the honor and respect she’s given throughout this book (by even the *gods*…), there’s no growth or maturity that demonstrates why she’s worthy of any of it, except she was *born* powerful. And Luther. Who I loved with my whole heart in the first books. He devolved into this puddle of “adoring” goo that just did everything Diem wanted whenever she wanted it, and followed her around like a lovesick puppy. He gets sick, follows Diem, follows Diem, spanks her (wth?), and follows Diem. End of character arc. There were almost no twists in this book that weren’t obvious chapters in advance. The leaps of logic necessary to justify some of the scrapes Diem and Luther got into (and out of) were flimsy at best in most cases. I found myself regularly going … “yes, yes, now she has another power, now she has another crown, mortals deserve more, no one sees it but her, got it” and skimming till some action would happen, just because I was hoping for redemption. At this rate, it would take *really* not having anything else to read for me to pick up book 4.","If ""that long ass zoom meeting that could have been an e-mail"" was a book"
Lightlark,Alex Aster,3.85,"I’M HOOKED. I have read this book 3 times since it was released. The second time was because the plot twist is massive (one of several) and the type that makes you immediately want to re-read to see how you could have missed it. The third time, I re-read because I missed the world. Also, because I learned this was going to be a movie, so I wanted to experience it again. The middle is a tad bit slow, but once you get to the ending, everything makes sense. I highly suggest you finish before forming a final opinion. Many things I’ve seen talked about are people not finishing the book and making conclusions based on a partial read. I recently saw that this book has been on the bestsellers list for like 6 months or something, and I am so glad people are still discovering this book. The romance was perfectly steamy, and kept you guessing until the end. The fantasy and action kept me reading well into the night. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book, because this is the next big thing. I cannot WAIT for this series to continue.","Since Lightlark is almost out, I wanted to write a short welcome note to readers, with an exciting announcement. I am thrilled to share that Lightlark is being made into a movie by Universal, and the producers of Twilight, The Maze Runner, The Hate U Give, The Fault in Our Stars, Paper Towns, Love, Simon, and many more of my favorite movies! The studio and producers read Lightlark pre-publication, and loved it, which is truly a dream come true.Thank you for your support, and interest in this book—it truly means the world to me. I put all of my favorite things into Lightlark: fantasy, romance, mystery, magic, and adventure. 6 rulers have 100 days on an island that only appears once every 100 years to break their deadly curses. Each curse is uniquely wicked. Everyone has a secret. There are lies and liars all around you… Welcome to the Centennial. <3","yes i did enjoy this book and no, no one is forcing me to say this. after reading this book. i can say lightlark’s target audience are adolescents. being 21 myself, i couldn’t connect with the story as a 14 year would have. and that’s perfectly ok.that being said, i still think it’s a well written, easy to read, and enjoyable story. is it the most unique thing i’ve ever read? no. but it is to some teenager out there. i enjoyed it for what it gave me not for what i wish it did. still, Aster included everything i loved in a YA fantasy in this book. i mostly enjoyed it for the nostalgia i felt reading it. with the enemies to lovers plot points, a lush story, and twist and turns i didn’t see coming…i’m excited to see where the rest of this story will lead and can’t wait for the sequel."
He Who Fights with Monsters: Book Twelve,"Shirtaloon, Travis Deverell",4.65,I love these booksYou could say they’re kind of my thing,"As always, I've blazed through the latest HeWho book and devoured it in mere days.The series has become a big comfort for me, and I'm always eager to read about the adventures of Jason & Co. That said I agree with some of the other comments that this book is a victory lap.This book takes place 20 years after the events of book 11, which makes the time skip extremely significant and it also tries to deal with the aftermath of book 11. Trying to juggle these elements as it sets up book 13 and the new story arc can make it seem rushed... Which it is.The beginning and ending third were the strongest parts, but this is a pure setup book. There is no tension or real conflict/danger to the characters. It is a triumphant return after the world shattering events of the best books in the series. And it is fine.I feel like so much more could have been developed, I think every conversation being about Jason is kinda tiring. I think some plot elements feel unearnt.But at the end of the day, did I like it? Yes. Quite so.","Going downhill While the story is still interesting, Jason is not. His powers are great, when he uses them, but this book was mostly politics, and unfortunately the author decided to bring real world politics and social issues into this fantasy world, even bringing them to a world that didn't have them. I understand social commentary, but at the same time ramming your personal beliefs into a fantasy style book is painful and a rather myopic, as it feels entirely shoehorned in. The humor is no longer there, he's no longer irreverent, and he's being actively reined in most of the time."
Wind and Truth,Brandon Sanderson,4.40,"One Billion Stars!“An oath could be broken, but a promise? A promise stood as long as you were still trying. A promise understood that sometimes your best wasn’t enough. A promise cried with you when all went to Damnation. A promise came to help when you could barely stand. Because a promise knew that sometimes, being there was all you could offer.”

Absolutely speechless!!

“Perhaps the question isn’t ‘What use is art?’ ” Wit mused. “Perhaps even that simple question misses the point. It’s like asking the use of having hands, or walking upright, or growing hair. Art is part of us, Kaladin. That’s the use; that’s the reason. It exists because on some fundamental level we need it. Art exists to be made.”
Brandon you need to give us answers!! guys, when he said that he would conclude arc 1 with book 5 I thought he meant giving these characters a somewhat proper end with like at least answers but he left us on a cliffhanger and now I cant wait for 7 years for him to like publish the next book!!! like I dont even know if I would be alive Brandon!! 2030?? that's so far away like I was jumping up and down thinking that if I die after 2024 I would die at least knowing that I had read Kaladin's arc and his ending but that didn't happen so like Brandon if you're reading this just like give me special services and write me the books first and yes that would be so much better, I will not share it with anyone and die happily PLEASE BRANDON LIKE PLEASE I CANT-okay now that the embarrassing rant is over lets move on to the actual book- look did I get what I want? No. but I wasn't expecting for it to go my ways because let's face it Brandon does what he wants and it bloody worked!! I loved this book so much like you dont know how much I miss reading this book, being in this world, reading about these characters and I honestly can't give two fucks about why other people didn't enjoy it or why they were underwhelmed, what matters is I enjoyed it and that I felt like this was the perfect way to conclude arc 1 and it honestly has me excited with that same energy and that same buzz for the next book so I think that it was wise for Brandon to pull this move. I'm writing the review rn but the first para was written a month back and lol now that I have calmed down, I think I can wait because we are being fed everyyyy year!! like secret project 5 this year?? horneater novella next year?? new skyward spinoff?? Elantris sequels??? mistborn era 3?? like this midpoint was so high and I honestly loved it and I cant wait for the other books in this series because I know that I will love them as much as this!2024 was not a good year for me. Life was weird and not how I wanted it to be. My anticipated books were flopping and everyday I would just wait for this book because I know this would be that one anticipated book that would not let me down, so I started a grand plan which was to reread every single Cosmere book and I am sooooo glad that I did because it made me appreciate everything about this universe I formed a deeper bod with the character and this finale' hit sooooo hard. I have heard people complain about Brandon's prose but I love it sooo much, the way he writes, the way he explains, the characters he creates are so hard not to love like my heart screams for this series like you see my reviews and how much I yap but they dont fully encapsulate what I feel because there's so much that im feeling when I visit this series and everything starts hitting me and it's just so beautiful. Every book in this universe has such memorable scenes, the just keep on playing in my head and just refusing to leave and uff it's breathtaking.Every stormlight book has like five parts and I was expecting the same here but I was so happy when I found out that it was divided in ten days and every day was going by so quick and the tension was increasing at the end of each chapter so like there was this feeling gnawing at me wanting for answers while also dreading the end, hoping that it would never come and honestly authors who write sequences that make me feel like this immediately go to my auto-buy shelves. My E-book had around 2000 pages and you should've seen the stupid smile on my face when I saw the page count because honestly I hate long books except for when its my favorite series. I feel like he started off this book so strong with how everyone was preparing for the duel and there was this theme that played into it where you know about something bad that's going to happen but the characters are unaware and you just want to scream so yeah that was there and then the days progressed and everyone was fully placed in their own stories and you would start feeling like its the end and ahh I knew my heart was about to break!!The emotional aspect that this book delivered hit so hard, like how does Brandon do it, it was so well done weaving with the world building, the lore and oh my god we got so many answers, we got to feel and experience so many things and this journey was so precious because there will never ever be a journey that will be like this like it's like one of those shows that you watch and love and think of shows similar to it but find none because I dont think even Brandon can top this series. I dont think Brandon needs an editor and I do think the world building in this series is more impressive than other high fantasy series, bite me bitches.
""Honor is dead but I'll see what I can do""
Moving on to the characters;Kaladin Stormblessed aka the love of my life and the bane of my existence. Did his story end with a love interest and happy life? No. Was me expecting that delusional? Absolutely one thousand percent yes. But honestly can my guy just get a break, pretty please Brandon :( I would love to see more of his new journey but when the scene that put him in this journey was happening I was yelling NO at the top of my lungs because I honestly dont know how everything would be like ugh I dont wanna spoil but if anyone has answers just please let me know but besides that whole fiasco lets talk about how much I loved this character in this book and how I would do anything for this character, This journey that Kaladin took was so important like I honestly wanted to see him fight and be in battles but I also liked the way he was trying to bring szeth to a better place and I really like that journey I feel like it was very much needed for him and the events that took place after them were soooo good.His journey was so unexpected tbh because during the beginning when Dalinar asked him to be their heir, I honestly the ending would go somewhere along the lines of that not him embracing that role, Im just happy that he's happy and ykw this book made me not hate the concept fo kal and syl that much and I think I can see it going somewhere in the future books but if there's anyway to avoid that I would gladly pray for that. Kaladin being annoyed at Nale was the highlight of this book and him giving death glares would never not be funny but honestly I need his level of patience because I would not have survived a trip with a person like Szaeth without throwing hands. His final meeting with bridge four and shallan and Adolin was so cute and istg if we don't get more moments like those I will riot Brandon.Im scared to see where his character is going to but I hope he finds peace and happiness but I am also quite excited t see where his journey will take us cuz Its gonna be so new and honestly I cant envision Kal in that role specifically being the leader, but lets see how brandon handles that.
“Would that any of us,"" he said, ""could protect ourselves from the costs of heroism. But, again, if there were no costs, no sacrifice, then would it be heroism at all?”
Adolin Kholin, is the most precious man there is to ever exist like the character development that he went through was so immense and strong and so beautiful to read like actually go back and read book 1 and compare that version of Adolin to this Adolin, there was always this sense of righteousness and kindness that was explored more throughout each book and his honor which was just so strong. SO to read about him and his story!! it was amazing. Also, the things Adolin was willing to do for Azir, the way he was fighting and his monologue was pretty fun to read like I remember spamming Hoda vms of how much I love him and how much I dont want anything to happen to him and I can safely say that book 4 and 5 really solidified his place alongside Kaladin's as my favorite characters of all time because they are just so well written.The relationship strain that was felt between Adolin and Dalinar was actually needed and the way it was delivered was so good like I came to terms with Dalinar's actions and was making my way to try and forgive him but seeing Adolin's reaction to it and to see a hole in the image that his father maintains hit so hard and I actually was on Adolin's side and ufff it was so conflicting because at one side I wanted for them to talk things out and work out but the other wanted Adolin to hate his father for what he did. The conflict between them was such a well addition to this book. Adolin's need to prove himself in front of his father. Uff I love him so much you don't understand!!!!Also SPOILER There being no stormlight and Adolin loosing his leg?? HEAL MY MAN RTFN!! SPOILERS ENDThe romance between Adolin and Shallan was added such a light and fun mix to this story and I loved the way it was unravelling and lmao not Brandon writing a fade to black scene (it was just passionspren rising) but it was sooooo good and I love how their relationship evolved and now that they're MARRIED I LOVEEEEEEEE THEM. I love how both of them get on Dalinar's nerves and I absolutely love them but I actually need to knowww if they'll meet again because when the book ended Adolin was at Azir and Shallan in the cognitive realm so please Brandon let them meet once again. DONT KEEP THEM APARTTTT. Also I love his relationship with the spren it was really good.
You think that kid who starved didn’t want to eat? You think her parents didn’t want to escape the ravages of war badly enough? You think if they’d had more Passion, the cosmere would have saved them? How convenient to believe that people are poor because they didn’t care enough about being rich. That they just didn’t pray hard enough. So convenient to make suffering their own fault, rather than life being unfair and birth mattering more than aptitude. Or storming Passion.”
Shallan Davar, since the start of this series. Shallan has been one of those character who has occasionally given me a very hard time but with each book I related to the character more and started understanding her and with this book Shallan grew into such a powerful character and the way she took control of her personalities and took action was really fun to read. Although I do feel like her story arc kind of took a backseat in this book but the parts of it that we got to read were soooo good and I honestly enjoyed. Her journey with Renarin and Rlain could have been expanded more but there were already so many things happening but it was definitely one that I wanted to see.Ba Ado Mishram is a character who I wanted to know more about and the event including her were so conflicting and I dont even know where to put her so her being in Shallan's arc made me enjoy it so much more, if it was ever to be adapted on the big screen I definitely Mishrams scenes would give me jumpscares because it was so creepy when described in the book. Also that one blessed appearance that we got to see, it was more like a cameo and I loved it so much. It has a link to it's own story so Im wondering if Shallan could possibly be have a small role in it. Unlikely but still possible but no expectation for that.
“A virtue is something that is valuable even if it gives you nothing. A virtue persists without payment or compensation. Positive thinking is great. Vital. Useful. But it has to remain so even if it gets you nothing. Belief, truth, honor … if these exist only to get you something, you’ve missed the storming point.”
Dalinar Kholin PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAINPAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAINBesides the pain, his arc was the best one to read after Adolin for me. There was so much that unraveled here. Things about Honor and the stormfather also things about the heralds and everything related to it and it was so good to read to finally get answers that I was longing for and the way he made us experience rather than us just being fed the information we actually got to see what happened which included the conversations between honor and Odium which I wanted to experience and I am so glad that Brandon chose this way rather than just feeding us the information also the whole conversations with the heralds and the previous bondsmith was so well done. The whole past journey that Dalinar had was amazing. Navani Kholin Her arc was intertwined with Dalinar's so I honestly had the same reactions to her arc's. I do feel like RoW was her strongest appearance.The most useless award goes to that dumb bitch Cultivation thanks for nothing bitch.
“Ideals are dead things,” Kaladin said, “unless they have people behind them. Laws exist not for themselves, but for those they serve.”
Jasnah Kholin, Honestly she ate. I love Jasnah and her as queen is amazing and during the whole of RoW I was craving some Jasnah scenes and this one delivered on that so well. I liked how much her character has progressed as well, little as compared to the others but I always liked Jasnah as she was, so it should be no surprise that I liked her here as well but one moment that really made her stand out in this book was her conversation/ debate with Odium. It was so good and it was so well done, it was so tense and it had me at the edge of my seat definitely one of the stronger moments of the book! I loved it Wit, He always is there at the right moments and I need dragonsteel soooo bad. I would get so worried when Wit wouldn't know something and would be terrified lmao and him bringing weird objects and trying to find loopholes was amazing lol. Travangian, is such a cunning villain, like when you think that you have him figured out he pulls out a wtf card and slaps you across the face with it. I think that's the best way to describe him, he terrified me.
“That should have made him an anxious, stewing pot of nerves. Instead he tipped his head back, sun warm on his skin, and acknowledged that while he didn’t feel great, someday he would feel great again. For today, that was enough.”
Szeth, He was the main focus of the book I think because of the past chapter and idk I was expecting something more traumatic when I first read about him but lol it started with rocks but oof his story did get deep and I did love how his character got a lot of page time and developed and the end where he finally achieved what Kal wanted him to. The darkness that enveloped him was so immense and the way it took so long to get him out, the conversations him and Kal had felt so real to read and honestly it was amazing. bridge four without rock and Teft and kal the crew felt a little hollow but sazed's scenes with leyten had me screaminggg, the whole renouncing scene had my heart stopped and that leyten scenes almost tipped me over to tears and MOASH I HATE YOUUUUU
“I’m a storyteller,” Wit said, with a flip of his fingers. “I have the right to redefine words.” “That’s stupid.” “That’s literature.” “It’s confusing.” “The more confusing, the better the literature.” “That might be the most pretentious thing I’ve ever heard.” “Aha!” Wit said, pointing. “Now you’re getting it.”
Plot, There was so much going on in this book, so many different stories taking place and then finally interconnecting but every single one of those plot points were done so so so so good and I loved reading every single one of them because I feel like I developed such strong feelings for the characters that whatever was happening felt so interesting and so good but honestly tho the whole lore dropping made everything 10x better Action LOVEE those scene so much, they were so well described and the World building as usual was the star if this book because without it, it would feel incomplete, it felt like missing piece of puzzle that fit perfectly in and Sanderson never goes wrong with his world building. I was so in love with it.Overall, It was one of the best reads of the last year!Some additional quotes:
“nothing is easier to sell someone than the story they want to hear.”.“The thing is, the deepest truths always sound a little trite. Because we all know them, and feel foolish being reminded.”.“And so, in the face of the most awful darkness he’d ever felt, Kaladin Stormblessed took a deep breath.Then stood up.”.“Welcome, Kaladin Stormblessed. Herald of Kings. Herald of the Wind. Herald of…”“Herald,” Kaladin said, “of Second Chances..“If you assume I will crusade against religion or other Shards simply because they exist, then you make a mistake. The same mistake made by all who give petty, casual thought to my heresy. They assume I replace religious ideology with an ideology of their absence. That is not the case. I am against dogma of any variety. God, nationality, or philosophy—when you become a slave to it without capacity to change or reconsider, that is the problem.”.“I will not lie, and promise you that all future days will be warm. But Ishar, you will be warm again - and that is another thing entirely to promise.”
ran out of space :( but yeah I absolutely love this book and would recommend for sure!___Ummm??? It's not finished 😭?? Bitch give me book 6-10 now I'm not waiting 7 years for that you can't leave me on a cliffhanger and expect me to wait 7 years because I SIMPLY WONT 🧍🏻 Brandon 👹 I. HATE. YOU ____I cant believe it's in my hands 🥹 I hope this is everything I hoped for and ahh cant believe the last stormlight book until the next arc begins in 7 years 😭Kal, Adolin and Shallan here I come<3-Buddy reading with Hoda.","The Stormlight Archive is probably the most important fantasy series in the past 15 years. It is therefore frustrating how conflicted I am about it, conflicted enough to write my first ever review. This is however, more a review of the series as a whole, rather than Wind and Truth in particular.SPOILERS below, on all 5 books of the seriesDon't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to love about this series. The ambition and the creativity poured into it are nothing less than inspiring. The decision to couple character's psychological growth with their progression in the magic system through the oaths was a stroke of genius and makes for some seriously amazing moments throughout the books. But I will not focus on the positives as too many people here have repeated them, and have in fact been glazing these books blindly.Instead, I would focus on other things that are, to me at least, either a mixed bag, or thoroughly frustrating.THE SCOPEI'm sorry, but there are simply too many things happening in these books. If done extremely well, that can be a good thing. But it isn't done well. Whole story arcs, like the murder of Sadeas, or Dalinar wanting to become High King, or whatever the hell Sja-Anat is doing, are brushed aside quickly, with minimal or forgettable consequences. Other things that happen don't exactly need to happen, like half the things Shallan has been up to these 5 books that I can't help but feel were utterly irrelevant to anything. In this last book, a whole heap of pages is devoted to the freeing of Ba Ado Mishram, which was set up as something that would be very hard to do, which turned out to be super easy. She led them to her, and all they needed to do was to shatter a jewel. You could have done it in a single chapter, instead we get a hundred pages of it. The whole Ghostbloods plotline felt utterly irrelevant every step of the way. Most of the many interludes felt vastly irrelevant every step of the way. The plotlines around the listeners and Venli were irrelevant every step of the way. And that isn't to say that these storylines aren't fun, that they aren't entertaining or worth reading, sometimes they are. And a book, a fantasy book especially, should indulge itself from time to time. But these books do it far too much, they buckle under their own weight of everything going on, half of which is irrelevant or only slightly relevant to the grand storyline. For example, the Yanagawn interlude that took up dozens of pages. Would it not have been better to piece together how he got the throne through dialogue with characters like Adolin? Imagine a series that focused solely on Odium and Honor, and perhaps the Heralds as a secondary storyline, much like how the first two books felt. Would have been much tighter knit and better, as these plotlines were the most interesting any way.THE LENGTH The smallest of these books is 1,100 pages. Now I have no problems with this, and have even read bigger books and series. The problem is the plot very often moves at a glacial pace, and all the books could be trimmed by about half with nothing lost in the reduction. Some would argue all this is necessary to lay the groundworks for better worldbuilding and character growth, but that isn't really true. A single Stormlight book is larger than the entirety of the Lord of the Rings, or, for example, Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie. Can anyone honestly claim that a single volume of Stormlight has more worldbuilding than the entirety of LOTR, or better character work than Best Served Cold? Not in good faith they can't. It is even more frustrating when, in all that length, big character moments like the reveal that Shallan is the daughter of a Herald are brushed off in a couple of paragraphs. On the other hand we get hundreds of pages exploring the gay romance of Renarin and Rlain, because Brandon wants to prove to his fans that he's not a regular Mormon, but a progressive, open-minded Mormon, and one of the good guys TM. We get hundreds of pages explaining the science behind how fabrials work, how each metal casing affects them, and other things literally no one cares about.THE CHARACTERSStormlight is universally praised for its character work, and indeed there is a lot to like here. Dalinar and Kaladin are obvious standouts, and their character moments will resonate and be remembered for years to come. Even Jasnah got a good crashing down to earth moment in the last book which she sorely needed. However, to me the character work is spoiled by looking at characters' psychology as a pampered kid from a wealthy area of California in the 21st century would. Every single character has a mental disability, be it depression, multiple personality disorder, autism, sociopathy, etc. And they're all hyper focused on it! The world is literally burning down beneath their feet, but instead we have to read about Shallan switching personalities every 5 minutes and obsessing about it. I promise you Brandon, as someone that has struggled with some of these issues, we do not hyperfixate on them, especially not if important things are happening in our lives that otherwise need our attention. The paths they take are also frustrating to me. The great warrior Kaladin become a therapist? Is this a joke? And we explore his therapy not through the person he's treating (who's also a POV character, but only for the action scenes), so we can get a look inside how he's receiving this therapy, but through the therapist himself obsessing about how he isn't doing a good enough job? And then all it takes for the therapy to be successful is soup, a song and the wind whispering encouragement, because no amount of discussion and debate would help, since his patients, both Szeth and Nale are literally immune to common sense? The character path Kaladin took is truly tragic. He was literally supposed to be the bridge between listener and human, because he walked among them and saw their point of view and their honor in character like Leshwi. Kaladin embodied the three principles of Protect, Lead and Heal. In the last book the first two were brushed aside completely. He had a whole falling out with his father over whether or not one could fight and kill to protect. Instead we get him accepting his father's wish to become a healer. Adolin and Dalinar are the only consistently good characters throughout the 5 books.THE PROSEI know, I know, everyone and their mother has already criticized Brandon for his prose. But it really is deserved. One moment you're reading a nice sentence, the next you're reading a TikTok comment. It is jarring, and I know Brandon can do better. It seems he isn't even trying most of the time and just churns out each sentence as it first comes to him, which is astonishing considering he has a whole company and scores of beta readers helping him, as well as (allegedly) preparing several drafts of every book and them being extensively edited. For his world, any world, to have an inner consistency of reality, there has to be a unified tone both in the prose and in the dialogue. Here we have it in neither. I get Brandon wants to complete 874 books before he dies, but maybe writing 20 books and making them the best they can be instead is preferable. And for the love of God someone stop him from attempting to write humor, or at least force him to make it a tad more sophisticated than poop and fart jokes. The POV shifts every 2 sentences in Wind and Truth were also very jarring and ruined any tension.THE WORLDBUILDING AND MAGICThis is more of a personal gripe. Lately it seems every fantasy book has strayed into the realm of medieval sci-fi. The world is another planet entirely populated by novel creatures. The magic system is actually science, here's a list of strict rules and a DnD chart showing the different types of magic, their weaknesses and strengths vs other types. Gone is the folk feeling, gone is the mystique of these worlds, gone is the sense of the forgotten past of mankind, of a young earth with many wonders and unexplainable things happening, of deep magic tapping into the very essence of the world and the human spirit. Instead, here's superheroes flying around blasting each other with lasers and devices for which we have to explain the exact process of creation, lest we be accused of actually including magic in a fantasy book. Because it's far more ""realistic"" if we have a device that emits heat because it has a fire spren locked in a copper casing and in a rhomboid shape, rather than if we just say it emits heat because it's magic. And listen, I get it, it's very fun to worldbuild, but what have we built exactly? Brandon is good at cosmology and magic systems, but doesn't seem to try much in other aspects. The human nations are caricatures, you have one nation of warriors, one of bureaucrats, one of Buddhist monks, one of merchants, etc. There are no differences in the way of life, architecture, culture, views, it's just one characteristic blown way out of proportion, and the different names they use to call the Heralds and Honor. Like can anyone tell me any difference between Jah Keved and Alethkar, two great and powerful nations, after reading 6,000 pages about this world? Even the spren in Shadesmar, a completely different form of life altogether, live exactly as humans, they take on human-like forms, they have buildings, markets, courts, currency, etc. The world feels utterly foreign, but not in an evocative way that can make you care about the world, or make you nostalgic about a forgotten place you half-dreamed of once, but in a way a slum in India would feel foreign. There's no cows, or dogs, or even trees, but there are 76 varieties of crabs in different sizes for your enjoyment. Meanwhile, it really is a question how anything survives in a world that's being destroyed by a storm every week, and even more a question now since at the end of Book 5 the Sun itself got blotted out. Thankfully, every human nation joined the guy that blotted out the sun and is literally named Hatred and openly discusses waging an endless interstellar war, because they'd be safer this way. Things have also gotten progressively more modern and 21-century-USA, as we have not only trans and non-binary characters, but also things like we see in Szeth's flashbacks, sibling rivarly, sibling resentment, love affairs and divorce. I get these things happened in the past as well, and I also get Roshar isn't Earth's past but a different planet, but the implementation still feels like I'm reading a Wattpad fanfic. It is probably the combination of the character's mentalities with the prose being what it is, that have progressively given each book a stronger YA feelingTHE PLOTJourney before destination, Brandon says, then proceeds to trample on that principle. Everything that happens in these books feels like a plot contrivance. Brandon wanted to get to point X, so he made up a million excuses to get there. Why can't the God you're fighting simply destroy you all with a snap of his fingers? Well he made a promise, and he's a god so he can't break it. Why did he make that promise? He didn't want to get destroyed in a fight with another God. Would that God have fought him? Not really, if he did the planet would have been destroyed. So why does the promise exist? Mumbles. The flashbacks are utterly frustrating as well. Show, don't tell, is the basic principle of storytelling, so Brandon shows nothing and spends 1/4 of each book in flashbacks where every plot point and character trait is revealed. It was especially egregious in the last book, where literally the entire history of the world and the whole plot were revealed through a flashback from God. Talk about Deus ex Machina eh Brandon? And if that wasn't enough Deus in this Machina, we get another mysterious being that's wiser and knows more than he should that told Dalinar how to resolve the final conflict. On top of another mysterious ancient being that's been guiding them the past 5 books whilst trying (and failing) to be funny. Meanwhile they have yet another God that's Dalinar's spren, but he refuses to tell them anything actually important or relevant because he's concerned how they'd take it, so he lets the world burn down instead. Oh, and there's yet another god in this book, whispering guidance in the wind, just in case the others weren't enough. Other plot contrivances abound. Like when the spren are all about to be destroyed, but the God they came out of can't destroy them because some random 10 people formed a pact? Why? And if he can't destroy the spren from Honor, why can't he destroy the spren from Odium at least? Or the unmade which are the greatest shards of his power and some of which are actually challenging him? No one knows. It is also frustrating how anticlimactic everything is. The Everstorm that's supposed to be a cataclysmic event? Barely an inconvenience. Shadesmar, a completely different realm of existence? It's actually just like our world, except the sea is land and vice versa. The Spitirual Realm, something even Wit was scared to enter and no one knew how to get back, especially when their tether was lost? Barely an inconvenience, just ask your spren to bring you back at any time. And I could go on and on. There is also something other reviewers mentioned, that no one faces consequenes for their actions. Not only that, they get excused for their failings, and everyone is 100% understanding of them. If on the off chance they aren't, like Adolin being angry at his father over his mother's death, that conflict soon resolves itself in the character's head. No one is angry at Shallan for not telling them about the Ghostbloods, no one is angry at Kaladin for moping around instead of fighting, no one is angry at Dalinar for his leadership mistakes, no one is angry at Jasnah for losing Thaylenah, etc. I will also mention that book 1 and 2 feel like a completely different universe to the rest. Everything set up in the first 2 books basically goes out the window, apart from the characters themselves. The setting is not there, the plot becomes something else entirely, the storylines are all novel, the lore gets either retconned or vastly expanded. It's no wonder most people prefer the tight knit story of the first 2 books, because it's barely the same story after that. I get there are hints are foreshadowings of what is to come, but the the two ""parts"" are vastly different. Take for example the oaths, vastly important to both the story and the character journeys in previous books. In book 5 they were easy, came to the characters in a second and without any struggle to accept them, only to be tossed away as unimportant a second later. It is especially egregious in the case of Kaladin, knowing how much he struggled with the first oaths, and the fourth one in particular. He now has the fifth oath come to him without any struggle, effort or growth. It was so inconsequential, when it was supposed to be the most meaningful and difficult, that I don't even remember what it was, despite just finishing the book, and despite remembering the other four all these years later. Also minor gripe, I don't think Wind and Truth had any Sanderlanche, nothing grand and epic in scope that stops you from putting the book down. Not that every book needs that, but it would have helped here, when it had so little going for it. Oathbringer for example, to me was saved by the climax, otherwise it would have been a much worse bookTHE PHILOSOPHYEvery work has an underlying philosophy that shines through in the plot and the characters. Brandon takes it a step further as well, with characters often discussing the morals of their actions. Except it very often doesn't work in the context of the plot. Oh no, they enslaved the Parshendi, aren't they monsters! Shouldn't the Parshendi get revenge on them now?! Well no actually, because you told us they were actually so dull they could barely remember to fetch themselves water to survive, and therefore wouldn't have even survived on their own. Jasnah planned assassinations on evil people or potential liabilities in the war against the God of hatred, so naturally this means you should join the God of hatred instead, who has done far worse things, because Jasnah is a hypocrite. We spent years and countless lives liberating your nation from occupation, so naturally you would turn against us the second you've been liberated. I refuse to kill my grandson, whom I haven't seen for 20 years at this point and is raging for my murder because he's been brainwashed, so I'll let the God of hatred take over the world instead and make it hell, and even double his power in the process. Surely the other Gods, who are all selfish cowards, will all intervene at this point, and surely their intervention will not destroy my whole planet in the process. As a bonus I'll be killed in the process and won't even get a noble sacrifice because he made an evil copy out of me before I died, which will taint the memory of me forever. Great, we even went into grimdark here while attempting to prove how doing the moral thing is always preferable, even if it means sacrificing the greater good. There's a good way to make that point, it's just not this, not in this instance and in this story. Dalinar has effectively gambled his entire planet's existence and future for a 1 in 1000 chance, and while I'm sure Brandon will find a way to make it all work out well in the end, the character within the story has no way of knowing that, making it a huge, and not well calculated risk.Overall, the Stormlight Archive is a good fantasy series, but it has glaring problems that most fans ignore, which I cannot. Blindly applauding anything any author does is inconceivable to me, and looking at how the books went down in quality from Words of Radiance onwards, it's obviously to the detriment of the work itself. There's a top 3 fantasy series in here somewhere, it's just buried in quite a bit of crem, and it could have been accomplished with a good editor, critical beta readers, and Brandon reigning in his desire to throw in a kajillion cool ideas inside, over seeing what is actually best for the characters and the story, and giving at least some thought to his prose.I would probably give it a 3.5 stars rating overall for the whole series, but giving it 3 stars to counteract the insane glazing its receiving. Overall, I would sort the books as:1. Words of Radiance 4.5 ⭐2. Way of Kings 4⭐3. Oathbringer 3.75⭐4. Rhythm of War 3.5⭐5. Wind and Truth 3⭐Which gives the average series rating of 3.75 ⭐, carried by the first half of the series, let down by the second","Dune Chapter 1 in the style of Brandon Sanderson:
Paul Atreides was sweating.What time was it? Ah, yes, it was a week… a week before … before … what exactly?In one week we are leaving for Arrakis, he thought. They also call it Dune. But I was born on Caladan.The room was hot. He held his Breath.
Wasn’t there supposed to be some old woman coming to visit mother today?
It was warm. He was at the Castle. Castle Caladan, it was called. It was a pile of Stone. Yet it was his home.26 years now. No… 26 generations.The old woman came in. She entered Paul’s room and looked at Paul. Paul was lying in his bed. She looked at him, thinking he was sleeping. She stood before his mother, looking like a witch, her hair looking like spiderwebs. Her eyes looked like jewels. “He is so small, Jessica”, she said. “Are we sure he is fifteen? Maybe in dog years”, the old woman mused.“What is a dog?”, Jessica asked.“Nevermind”, the old woman said."
Tress of the Emerald Sea,"Brandon Sanderson, Howard Lyon (Illustrator)",4.34,"4.5/5 starsTress of the Emerald Sea was simply whimsical and wonderful. Starting the year 2023 with the first secret novel from The Year of Sanderson is the correct action for me.
“Even small actions have consequences. And while we can often choose our actions, we rarely get to choose our consequences.”
The time is here. The first of the four awaited secret project novels, Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson is here. If you're active in the fantasy community, or even if you're not, it is no longer news that Sanderson has shocked the world with the immense success of his four secret novels Kickstarter campaign. I mean, number one most pledged Kickstarter campaign of all time; it doesn’t get more successful than that. And it shouldn’t also come as a shock that I, as a longtime fan of his Cosmere novels, end up enjoying Tress of the Emerald Sea. I wanted to start my year with a great book, and choosing this book as the first novel of 2023 (as I said) was the right pick. Sanderson plus a full-length Cosmere novel is a formula that never ceases to impress me. What I did not expect, however, was just how visually beautiful Tress of the Emerald Sea would be. I am pleasantly surprised. I am glad the past Petrik decided to buy four premium hardcover editions of the secret novels, and I am eternally thankful to my co-blogger, TS, for covering the expense of the shipping fee. Without TS, I do not think I would cave into buying the premium hardcover editions, and I would regret it so much. I will go into more details on this later, but at $40 per secret novel (not counting the shipping fee) and for everything we get, this special edition can be considered, relatively, a bargain. This is on top of it being such a fun and cozy book to read.
“Leaving didn’t feel exciting. It felt heavy. Every child looked forward to the day when they could choose a different path from the one their parents were on. Tress sincerely hoped she hadn’t decided on one that led straight off a cliff.”
All her life on an island named The Rock in the emerald-green ocean, Tress lived a simple life with the simple pleasures of collecting cups received from sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend, Charlie. But when Charlie’s father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must leave her simple life to stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Although I expected to love this book, I was initially worried after reading the first few chapters. Note the word ship in the official premise. Sailing and seafaring dominated the majority of Tress of the Emerald Sea. Personally, I tend to have mixed feelings about fantasy books with a heavy focus on seafaring unless they're The Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb and The Tide Child trilogy by R.J. Barker. And there were indeed some sections here where I felt a bit of a lull because of this. However, my overall experience was fun. Most of the time, it was difficult for me to stay away from the book. Sanderson's prose and the relatively short length of the novel, plus its short chapters, made it easy for me to steal-read one or two chapters whenever I had some free time. This was a delightful book about human beings, contradictions, leadership, found family, stories, love, bravery, and empathy.
“It might seem that the person who can feel for others is doomed in life. Isn’t one person’s pain enough? Why must a person like Tress feel for two, or more? Yet I’ve found that the people who are the happiest are the ones who learn best how to feel. It takes practice, you know. Effort. And those who (late in life) have been feeling for two, three, or a thousand different people… well, turns out they’ve had a leg up on everyone else all along. Empathy is an emotional loss leader. It pays for itself eventually.”
Before reading Tress of the Emerald Sea, I did not read any of the secret novel preview chapters. However, based on the known artists and the title or premise of the four novels, Tress of the Emerald ranked third out of four. I am interested in all four, but I am most excited about the third and fourth secret novels. Based on these, the first two secret novels felt like they would be the most tonally different from Sanderson's other Cosmere books. Having read all published Cosmere stories, including this one, I can convey that Tress of the Emerald Sea has proved it. Sanderson has mentioned that The Princess Bride is one of the main inspirations behind this book. Another good comparison for what kind of tone you're getting here is Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman. So it is time to admit something. I haven't read or watched The Princess Bride yet, but I have watched Good Omens. And I think Sanderson nailed the comparison he's going for. The storytelling is whimsical and light-hearted in tone but also imbued with clever philosophical nuggets and serious themes occasionally. I loved the novel for it. I don't think I would've liked it this much if it was just all fun and joy all the way through. Sanderson's comedy, especially when the narrative involves young adult characters, doesn't land well with me often. But his hard-hitting and thought-provoking passages? That's another story. Sanderson may not have flowery prose, but the words he put on the pages of his novel frequently hit and became passages I think about daily. A few examples from this book are:
“While a healthy measure of foolhardiness drove our ancestors toward discovery, fear kept them alive. If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.”
And also these two long passages about memories.
“Beyond that, memories have a way of changing on us. Souring or sweetening over time— like a brew we drink, then recreate later by taste, only getting the ingredients mostly right. You can’t taste a memory without tainting it with who you have become. That inspires me. We each make our own lore, our own legends, every day. Our memories are our ballads, and if we tweak them a little with every performance… well, that’s all in the name of good drama.”

“Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again. Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing— like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure— we make of our memories the gods which judge our current lives. I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it’s at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We’re happy, sure, but were we more happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of our past… Do not let memory chase you. Take the advice of one who has dissected the beast, then rebuilt it with a more fearsome face— which I then used to charm a few extra coins out of an inebriated audience. Enjoy memories, yes, but don’t be a slave to who you wish you once had been. Those memories aren’t alive. You are.”
Although possible, it wouldn't feel organic to have these kinds of passages appearing throughout the book if the novel is told through the first-person or third-person perspective of Tress. These were effective because the entire story in Tress of the Emerald Sea is narrated through Hoid's perspective. Hoid is an integral character in Sanderson's Cosmere universe. And we, Cosmere fans, are all waiting for Hoid's origin story. Sanderson mentioned he wanted to practice and be more fluent at writing Hoid's perspective before that backstory novel happened, and this is the book where it came to fruition. This won't, however, be how the story is told eventually in Hoid's backstory novel. It will definitely be less whimsical. But to give you an idea of the kind of voice Sanderson is giving Hoid in this book, if you've read The Stormlight Archive series, this is more in tune with the unforgettable ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon"" stories Hoid told in the series. A full-length version of that kind of in-world story. I absolutely loved ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon,"" and obviously, I ended up loving Tress of the Emerald Sea as well.
“Worldbringers like myself spend decades combing through folk tales, legends, myths, histories, and drunken bar songs looking for the most unique stories. We hunt for bravery, cleverness, heroism. And we find no shortage of such virtues. Legends are silly with them. But the person who is willing to reconsider their assumptions? The hero who can sit down and reevaluate their life? Well, now that is a gemstone that truly glitters, friend.”
So yes, we get to learn more about Hoid and the Cosmere (more on this in the next paragraph) inside this book. But at the end of the day, even though this is told through Hoid's perspective, Tress of the Emerald Sea is still a standalone story about Tress and her adventures. I mentioned The Stormlight Archive earlier, and I am no stranger to voicing how much I love the Bridge Four group in the series. The found family trope is one of the many things Sanderson executed extremely well in The Stormlight Archive and the first Mistborn trilogy. And he managed to craft another cherishable found family in this book. Tress, Huck, Fort, Salay, and all the characters are well-written and likable characters. The Deaf character representation was written with the help of a special sensitivity reader to do it justice, too. And hey, for the first time in the Cosmere, we finally get to see a real dragon. As Tress and the crew of the ship she's in face danger constantly, the bonds between them grow deeper and deeper. My investment in them, too. And upon reaching the last page, I can't help but hope we will get more stories or appearances from these characters eventually. Knowing how connected with each other the Cosmere is now, I'm confident we will.
“She… didn’t need to do this all on her own. That shouldn’t have been such a revelation for her. But after spending ages walking around with everyone piling bricks in your arms, it can throw you off balance when someone removes a brick to carry for you.”
Speaking of Cosmere connections, and because people will ask me this question, should you read other Cosmere books first? Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story in the world of Lumar. This marks the first time we get a book taking place in this world in the Cosmere. Like always, it is not necessary to read the other Cosmere books first to enjoy the main story here. But will you benefit from reading them? Yes, you will. I talk about this already in my review of The Lost Metal. But moving forward, Sanderson's future publications in the Cosmere universe, especially the ones taking place after book 5 of The Stormlight Archive, will most likely have heavy Cosmere crossovers. If you intend to read all of Sanderson's Cosmere books, it is a good idea to start catching up reading them if you want to reap all the connections. As for this book, reading the entirety of The Mistborn Saga so far will be beneficial. Additionally, there were a few small nods to the magic or technology portrayed in Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Stormlight Archive. I will leave it to you to decide whether you want to read them first or not. There is no spoiler for these three series. Also, although not the primary planet of the magic and there is no main novel for it yet, aethers and its explosive potential are explored here.
“Now, most people would agree that humans are not telepathic. We can’t directly send our thoughts or emotions into the minds of others. Nevertheless, you can hear my story and imagine the things I describe—the same as I picture them in my own mind. What is that, if not a form of telepathy?”
One more thing before I end this review. I will update this once I have the physical copy, but right now, even the ebook of the premium edition alone is exquisitely made. Unless the paper quality of the physical copy sucks, which is so doubtful, I can vouch that the $40 I spent on getting this book is well spent. Maybe too well spent. It is almost ridiculous. You won’t get a premium/special edition like this with only $40 anywhere else. If Subterranean Press or Grim Oak Press publishes a book like this, I guarantee it will cost at least $200 (not counting the shipping fee and customs fee yet). The stunning design and the more than ten interior artworks (four fully colored art and the rest in green-toned black and white) by Howard Lyon enhanced the quality of the aesthetic and the tale. They are magnificent. And I am brimming with excitement waiting for the physical copy to arrive at my place. And if the first secret novel already reaches this level of production value, I want to read and find out what the other three will look like. Rest assured, in this review, I leave out some surprises in the clever design and artwork inside this book for you to find out for yourself.
“One of the great tragedies of life is knowing how many people in the world are made to soar, paint, sing, or steer— except they never get the chance to find out.”
Whether aesthetically or narrative-wise, Tress of the Emerald Sea provided a whimsical and wonderful reading experience. It is a refreshing addition to the Cosmere universe. And it is essentially (at least, it read like one) a Cosmere version of an adult fairy tale. With the success of the secret projects, some readers might think Sanderson favors quantity instead of quality in his books recently. It is up to you to think that way, but I can't voice the same sentiment. Personally speaking, Tress of the Emerald Sea doesn't show any drop in storytelling quality. Every book in the Cosmere, including this that he wrote in secret, works amazingly well for me. Similarly to the first Mistborn trilogy, even though this is undoubtedly a different kind of book, I think Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story that can be enjoyed by both YA or adult fantasy readers. Making this even more appealing to a bigger audience. This is a superb first book of 2023 for me, and I hope this signals the positive trajectory of my reading year. I look forward to receiving the physical copy and reading the next secret novel.
“The first is that heroes can be trained. Not by a government or a military, but by the people themselves. Heroes are the ones who have thought about what they’re going to do, and who have trained to do it. Heroism is often the seemingly spontaneous result of a lifetime of preparation… In the frenzied anarchy of destruction, loyalty to causes and kingdoms alike tends to fall to the chaos. But the bond between people, well, that’s stronger than steel. If you want to create heroes, don’t give them something to fight for. Give them someone to fight for.”

Rowling, Mary GrandPré (Illustrator)",4.58,"(A) 85% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A flavorful foreboding, it plies expanded bandwidth, like ripened fruit, and more acute: a sweet and spicy sandwich.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:02/13/2020 - PreambleOf all the books, most people say this one's their favorite. I believe a big reason why is it hits the sweet-spot between the middle-grade fare of the first two and the dark seriousness of the last four. On the whole, I enjoyed the last four more, as serial installments of the ""Voldemort is back"" storyline. But of the standalone books, I like this best.02/14/2020 - 4%(1) Hedwig flew all the way to France, assuming Hermione would have a gift for Harry. A bit presumptuous.(2) Hermione's letter: ""Dear Harry, Ron wrote to me ... Did you see that picture of Ron and his family ... Ron says he's going to be in London ... Ron says Percy's Head Boy ... Ron doesn't seem too happy.""- Ron, Ron, Ron. It's all about Ron.02/15/2020 - 7%(1) ""Ron Weasley ... came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before.""- Filmmakers should've taken note... not so much the telephone part.(2) Everyone's weirdly casual about the fact that Harry's punished with beatings. Likely entirely acceptable in the early '90s.02/16/2020 - 12%(1) ""Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other).""- Well, wizards use wooden wands to kill each other too.(2) Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit.""- Trousers? Suit? Fudge enjoys muggle clothes, I see.02/17/2020 - 15%(1) Hermione takes Muggle Studies. Which, while not cheating, is a lot like taking a language you're fluent in.(2) '[Hermione's] arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.""You bought that monster?"" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.""He's gorgeous, isn't he?"" said Hermione, glowing.'- Well, Hermione does have a thing for gingers.02/18/2020 - 18%(1) When arguing about Harry's safety, it's Arthur who insists on extra precautions, while Molly believes Dumbledore knows what's best. I'd have thought it'd be opposite.(2) ""Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally Harry.""- I wonder if Molly ever treated her kids' other friends this way. Possibly, she's seen the future.02/19/2020 - 27%(1) ""Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding.""- That's quite the meta statement.(2) '[Professor Trelawney] shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, ""beware a red-haired man."" Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.'- Hmm, it'd be a much better omen for Padma, Ron’s Yule Ball date.02/20/2020 - 30%(1) Pansy Parkinson is totally Malfoy's Lavender Brown. Unlike Ron, Malfoy's content to string her along.(2) Malfoy calls Buckbeak ugly, provoking an attack. Wonder if hippogriffs understand English or are just sensitive to tone.(3) Ron's surprisingly proficient at potions, at least where knifework is concerned. His roots are ""beautifully cut.""02/21/2020 - 34%(1) Parvati's greatest fear is mummies. I'd assume they'd only be a real threat in Egypt. Though, perhaps she was menaced by one brought over for Victorian unwrapping parties.(2) Lupin and the Marauders mocked Snape as students. Lupin encourages Neville to mock Snape in effigy. Snape bullies Neville more than ever. Not right, but it makes sense.02/22/2020 - 37%(1) Crookshanks kills a spider, and eats it in front of Ron. Then goes to kill Scabbers: taking out all Ron's natural enemies.(2) ""Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.""- See, who said Ron and Hermione can't get along, just the two of them?02/23/2020 - 41%(1) The Hufflepuff quidditch team's secret weapon is Cedric Diggory... who makes all the female Griffindor players giggle and swoon.(2) Snape calls Hermione an ""insufferable know-it-all."" Ron yells at Snape and gets detention... only Ron gets to call her that ;)(3) Snape makes Lupin's class study werewolves... because he's such a troll.02/24/2020 - 45%(1) Lupin: ""Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the [werewolf] essay.""""Oh no,"" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. ""I've already finished it!""- This is why I procrastinate.(2) Trips to Hogsmede essentially serve as bonding-time for Ron and Hermione. Or at the very least, a ceasefire during their pet conflict.02/25/2020 - 49%(1) Ron has a crush on Madame Rosmerta, which the book only hints at. In the film Hermione teases him about it.(2) In the book Harry finds Ron and Hermione in Honeydukes. In the film they're by themselves in a secluded wood:Hermione: ""Do you want to move a bit closer?""Ron: ""Huh?""Hermione: ""To the Shrieking Shack.""Ron: ""Oh no. I'm fine here.""02/26/2020 - 55%(1) For someone who scolds others for breaking rules, Hermione's awful cavalier about entering the boys' dormitory.(2) '""When thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!""... Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.""Tripe, Sibyll?""Professor Trelawney ignored her.'- McGonagall with the sly diss!02/27/2020 - 58%(1) I'd imagine butterbeer must taste something like a cross between butterscotch and root beer.(2) Dementors drain happiness. The remedy for a dementor attack is chocolate. Ergo, chocolate equals happiness.(3) Hermione's favorite subject is arithmancy. I'd never have taken her for a numbers person. But then, math is the opposite of divination.02/28/2020 - 62%(1) Cho is to Harry as Cedric is to the Gryffindor girls. Eyes on the snitch, Harry! Not the girl!(2) Harry is to the Firebolt as Jon Snow is to Longclaw.(3) '""Penelope and I have got a bet on,"" [Percy] told the team. ""Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!""- Yes, because making your girlfriend pay you money is always a good idea. *eye-roll02/29/2020 - 64%(1) Hermione: ""Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about [the Marauder's] map!""- Oh, Hermione. Always resorting to blackmail. Like getting Harry's broom confiscated worked so well.(2) Hagrid: ""Really upset, [Hermione] was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron.""- Never confide in Hagrid, he always spills beans!03/01/2020 - 66%(1) Ron to invisible Harry: '""Where are you? ... Are you still there? This feels weird!""'- ""Weird"" seems to be Ron's catchphrase, as in ""Weird! What a shape! This is money?"" or “So that’s a house-elf? ... Weird things, aren’t they?”(2) ""Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands.""- Blame it on herbology!03/02/2020 - 68%(1) '""Oh, Ron!"" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.'- Ron's not used to being hugged, I guess. Pats go on the back.(2) Ron totally gets turned on by Hermione punching Malfoy. She should've done it sooner!03/03/2020 - 70%(1) Hermione quits divination... which fulfills the prophesy of the lost pupil!(2) Trelawney: ""Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?""Ron: ""I don't need help ... There's going to be loads of fog tonight.""(3) For a supposed charlatan, Trelawney's remarkably accurate with her omens... albeit imprecise.03/04/2020 - 73%(1) Co-ed changing rooms seem like a recipe for disaster.(2) Penalty shots in quidditch are never adequately explained or described. Is it soccer-style, where the shot's taken from a fixed position? Or is it hockey-style, where the player moves toward the goalkeeper?(3) Apparently, wizarding trials involve a judge, jury, and executioner.03/05/2020 - 75%(1) Apparently, Ron has giant feet. Could well call him Ronald McDonald instead of Ronald Weasley.(2) Like Neville, Hermione's boggart is also a teacher. It's McGonagall saying she's failed everything. Unlike Neville, she fails to find the humor in it.(3) Hermione blushes when Ron compliments her rule-breaking. Weird what passes for sweet-talk.03/06/2020 - 77%(1) I'm getting a definite ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" vibe at the scene where the Grim pulls Ron below ground.(2) At the execution scene, both Harry and Hermione fall to pieces. Surprisingly, it's Ron that's the pillar of strength.(3) The tunnel at the base of the Whomping Willow goes off the Marauder's Map. It's literally uncharted territory.03/07/2020 - 79%(1) ""'If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!' [Ron] said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.""- Another estimable Ron line/act given to Hermione in the film.(2) Knowing how the book plays out takes all the edge out of seeing Sirius as a villain.03/08/2020 - 82%(1) Lupin seeing Peter on the Marauder's Map is a spit-take I want to see!(2) Hermione's awfully naive, assuming every Animagi voluntarily registers with the Ministry. But then, she's new to rule-breaking.(3) I heard J.K. Rowling say once that being a werewolf was akin to living with AIDS. Really makes you read Lupin's origin story differently.03/09/2020 - 87%(1) ""Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince.""- Far cry from the film, where Ron's a whimpering wreck. Though, I did get a kick out of film-Ron milking his injuries to bait care and attention from Hermione. Book-Ron would never be so bold!03/10/2020 - 91%(1) Ron's in the hospital, leaving Harry and Hermione to save the day. It was the other way around last book, which is an interesting bit of mirroring.(2) ""[Madam Pomfrey] was carrying the largest block of chocolate [Harry] had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.""- I have a feeling medicinal chocolate may not taste so great.03/11/2020 - 94%(1) ""From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.""- One major aspect of Hermione lost in the films is how terrified she is all the time. She gets braver each book. It's called character development!(2) Harry bows to Buckbeak before leading him away. Who says you never learn anything practical in Care of Magical Creatures?03/12/2020 - 96%(1) Hermione: ""Harry, I can't believe it... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those Dementors! That's very, very advanced magic.""Harry: ""I knew I could do it this time because I'd already done it... Does that make sense?""Hermione: ""I don't know.""- It's a chicken and egg paradox... where did the confidence come from to begin with?!03/13/2020 - 98%(1) '""[Sirius Black] didn't disapparate!"" Snape roared, now very close at hand. ""You can't apparate or disapparate inside this castle! This–has–something–to–do–with–Potter! ... They helped him escape, I know it!""'- Well, Snape's right about that.(2) Must get to writing my review. How does one distill Harry Potter in a sentence? It's never easy.","I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",This is a Weasley appreciation post.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré (Illustrator)",4.57,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:03/15/2020 - Preamble(1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga.""(2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts.03/16/2020 - 2%(1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three.(2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020 - 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020 - 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020 - 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020 - 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020 - 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020 - 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020 - 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020 - 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020 - 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020 - 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020 - 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020 - 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020 - 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020 - 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020 - 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020 - 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020 - 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020 - 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020 - 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020 - 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020 - 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020 - 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020 - 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020 - 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020 - 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020 - 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020 - 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020 - 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020 - 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020 - 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020 - 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020 - 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020 - 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source.*character limitClick here for the rest","Don't mind me, just crying my eyes out. This was WAY better than I remember it being, and I remember it being pretty darn good. J.K. Rowling is a writing goddess and I can't believe how much foresight and planning went into this series. She already hints at the horcruxes and many other things in this book that don't show up until much later. Definitely one of my favorites in the series (but I say that about all of them)!","Um. Wow. Yeah. That was freaking FANTASTIC!!!! Probably my favorite so far, just wow oh my gosh......WHAT EVEN!! I feel empowered and sad at the same time (sad because...you know). 5/5 stars of course!"
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré (Illustrator)",4.50,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: An angsty apprehension, it's a tome of teacher torment, misbelief, new girlfriend grief, and dread no longer dormant.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:05/04/2020 - Preamble(1) You can tell things have gotten dark from the title sequence. No longer shiny metal against still skies. Now it's rusty, pitted metal against billowing clouds.(2) Prior to my current re-read of the series, this was my favorite. Before that it was ""Half-Blood Prince."" Wonder if it'll keep its position or if I'll have a new favorite this time.05/05/2020 - 4%(1) Harry: ""Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too?""- Oh, I can think of a few reasons...(2) Harry openly insulting his aunt and uncle and picking a fight with Dudley? This isn’t the Harry I know!(3) Super-angsty to start. ""No one understands me, no one tells me anything""... Someone’s been listening to Radiohead.05/06/2020 - 6%(1) If you’re a wizard, don’t give your kids the initials AF, they’ll likely be a squib: Arabella Figg, Argus Filch.- Mrs. Figg's cat keeps tabs on Harry. Wonder if it's magic?(2) Petunia: ""I heard — that awful boy — telling her about [dementors] — years ago.""Harry: ""If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?""- She means Snape.05/07/2020 - 8%(1) ""Mundungus Fletcher"" is maybe Rowling's most expressive name, alluding to the words ""fungus,"" ""dung,"" and ""retch.""(2) Rowling loves adverbs. ""Stupidly"" is perhaps the most overused.(3) Lupin: ""And this is Nymphadora —""Tonks: ""Don’t call me Nymphadora ... It’s Tonks.""- She does take his name when they're wed. Can't be that insistent on it.05/08/2020 - 9%(1) Tonks: ""Are you mad, Mad-Eye?""- Well, it's in the name. Though it could just be the eye that's mad.(2) House elf heads line the hallway of Sirius' place. Awfully macabre... though muggle taxidermy is common, so is placing urns on mantles.(3) Ron and Hermione spend the summer mostly alone in bedrooms together... wonder what they do all day?05/10/2020 - 11%(1) Who knew Percy would be the Weasley black sheep?(2) Bill leaves Egypt for a desk job in London just to be close to Fleur. Some might call that romantic... others might call it stalking.(3) Molly: ""Who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?""Also Molly: ""Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing?""- I mean, put two and two together.05/11/2020 - 12%(1) '""Arthur!"" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. ""Arthur, back me up!""'- Is it really backing up a point if it's by coercion? and in front of everyone at that?(2) ""[Harry] had been touched by what [Mrs. Weasley] had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling.""- Wonder if ""mollycoddling"" is why she's named Molly?05/12/2020 - 14%(1) '""Size is no guarantee of power,"" said George. ""Look at Ginny.""""What d’you mean?"" said Harry.""You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?""'- Married life will fix that.(2) ""Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George ... [looked] rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths.""- Life imitates art.05/13/2020 - 19%(1) ""Mrs. Weasley ... started fussing with [Harry's] T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.""- Get used to having a mom.(2) The Ministry has jurisdiction over Britain and Ireland. Huh, must not have split when Ireland left the union.(3) ""a heavy locket that none of them could open.""- Hmmm, curious...05/14/2020 - 20%(1) ""Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.""- In other words: Latin, Old-French, Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Old-English.(2) Molly: ""I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!""George: ""What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?""- Well, Harry was facing expulsion. Between Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Ron's the clear choice.05/15/2020 - 22%(1) '""Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner ...Congratulations Ron and Hermione — New Prefects.""'- Cut out the ""New Prefects"" bit and you could reuse that banner.- It's always ""Ron and Hermione,"" like they're a music act or a comedy duo.(2) ""Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either.""- It nearly always boils down to daddy issues.05/16/2020 - 23%(1) Considering the amount of time prefects spend together, it's no wonder so many end up as couples.(2) ""[Harry] would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people ... he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.""- Ginny's also there, but Harry's as yet blind to her.05/17/2020 - 24%(1) '""Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?"" he asked.""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Hermione sharply.'- More Ron/Hermione mirroring. Until now, it's always been Ron who's defended Hermione's honor against Malfoy's jibes. Here it's the other way around.(2) With Delores Umbridge, it'd be far more fitting for her initials to be FU instead of DU.05/18/2020 - 25%One of these things is not like the other.(1) Students find it odd that Umbridge wears a pink cardigan. Not so much because it’s ugly, but mainly because it’s muggle attire. You know who else wears muggle clothes? Fudge. Umbridge is an insincere flatterer who does, or wears, anything to get to the top. A simple pink cardigan can say a lot about personality.05/19/2020 - 27%(1) ""Harry was too used to [Ron and Hermione's] bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his ... steak-and-kidney pie.""- Smart. He's got his priorities straight.(2) Harry: ""[Umbridge's speech] sounded like a load of waffle to me.""Hermione: ""There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle.""- Mmm... waffles.05/20/2020 - 28%(1) Hermione hates Lavender because she's anti-Harry.- She'll hate her even more when she's pro-Ron.(2) Ron and Hermione as prefects are like an old married couple. Hermione even bosses Ron around like Molly does with Arthur.(3) ""Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls.""- That gang sounds terrifying!- I always hated Cho.05/21/2020 - 30%(1) ""Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,"" said Ron sagely.- It's a much sharper metaphor than leopards.- Ron's all about wizarding common sense.(2) Umbridge sings her responses to student queries. Though, Mary Poppins she's not.(3) '""Have a biscuit, Potter.""""Have — what?""""Have a biscuit!"" [McGonagall] repeated impatiently.'- Take a biscuit, Harry!05/22/2020 - 31%(1) Hermione: If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —""Fred: ""Put us in detention?""George: ""Make us write lines?""Hermione: ""No ... but I will write to your mother.""- Ouch! She sure knows how to twist the knife.(2) Hermione knits woolly hats and hides them under rubbish, hoping to trick house elves into freedom as they clean.- I mean, that's just unethical.05/23/2020 - 34%(1) Angelina's not an ideal Quidditch captain. When she's stressed she gets bossy, when she can't get her way she gets stressed, and so on.(2) Ron spots Harry's scarred hand and implores him to tell McGonagall or Dumbledore.- Yet another Ron scene given to Hermione in the film.(3) Knitting things no one wants is yet another trait Hermione has in common with Molly.05/24/2020 - 35%(1) Ron makes the Quidditch team by process of elimination. Two people fared better at keeper tryouts, but Angelina found one whiny and the other unreliable. Thank goodness for that!(2) ""[Harry] walked on, feeling quietly elated ... [Cho] did not hate him for being alive!""- Well, that's an awfully low bar. I'm fairly sure most people don't hate him for being alive.05/25/2020 - 37%(1) O=Outstanding, E=Exceeds Expectations, A=Acceptable, P=Poor, D=Dreadful, T=Troll.- And people complain about my grading system...(2) Fred: ""Nothing wrong with a good, healthy P.""- I expect higher brow humor from the likes of Fred and George... puns are my thing.(3) Feel free to use my gifs. I post them on Imgur at: https://imgur.com/user/jaysongo/posts05/26/2020 - 39%(1) '""But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —"" Hermione began.""You sound like Molly,” said Sirius.'- Hermione/Molly comparisons continue.(2) Hermione: ""You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in... we’ve got to do something about [Umbridge].""Ron: ""I suggested poison.""- Well, poison would certainly be effective.- Ron, always with the practical ideas.05/27/2020 - 41%(1) Ron: ""You’re not still in contact with [Viktor], are you?""Hermione: ""So what if I am? ... I can have a pen pal if I —""Ron: ""He didn’t only want to be your pen pal.""- Ron knows what's up.(2) ""The barman ... [had] a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.""- Hmm... who's tall and thin with a long beard?05/28/2020 - 44%(1) Ginny starts dating Michael Corner, Ron hates Michael Corner... it's math.(2) Hermione: ""It says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls.""- On the whole, sure. Though a girl is the book's big turncoat.(3) Harry: ""Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself...""- Moments after founding a clandestine outlaw combat guild.05/29/2020 - 47%(1) In the book, The Room of Requirement is Dobby's idea, in the film it's Neville's. Same with gillyweed in ""Goblet of Fire.""- Ergo, film Neville is book Dobby.(2) Hermione: ""I think we ought to elect a leader.""Cho: ""Harry’s leader.""Hermione: ""Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly ... It makes it formal.""- I don't know... the vote seems rigged to me.05/30/2020 - 51%(1) '""Good luck, Ron,"" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek ... He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened.'- Ron had the same reaction with Fleur, except Hermione doesn't have veela powers.(2) ""Weasley is Our King"" is a hit song. Everyone sings it.05/31/2020 - 52%(1) ""Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains.""- My feeling exactly! But then, I'm from the tropics.(2) Dobby: ""HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!""- ""Harry"" as an adjective means to harass. So, I suppose I'll take it as a pun.06/01/2020 - 54%(1) '""Mistletoe,"" said Luna dreamily, pointing ... over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under it. ""Good thinking ... It’s often infested with nargles.""'- I'd ship Harry and Luna.(2) Ron: ""What does she see in Krum?""Harry: ""I suppose he’s older, isn’t he ... and he’s an international Quidditch player.""Ron: ""Yeah, but apart from that.""- Ron's too obvious sometimes.06/02/2020 - 58%(1) Harry: ""Are they doctors?""Ron: ""Doctors? ... Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?""- Ron's descriptions of the Muggle world never ceases to be a treat.(2) Arthur: ""I was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest ... You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer?""- Well, that's a loose end I never expected to be tied up.06/03/2020 - 62%(1) Arthur: ""Well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are?""Molly: ""It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together ... but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid —""- I guess Ron takes after his mother.(2) ""Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket.""- One of the most poignant lines in the entire series.06/04/2020 - 63%(1) Hermione gets Harry and Ron homework planners for Christmas, which is kind of like gifting someone a diet book... it sends a message.(2) '""I want you to take this,"" [Sirius] said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.""What is it?"" Harry asked.'- It's Chekhov's Gun... uh, Chekhov's book-sized package.06/05/2020 - 66%(1) Neville should have been the one to kill Bellatrix. Would have been justice for torturing his parents to insanity.(2) I figure with a name like Madame Puddifoot, your career options are rather limited. Either be the proprietor of a girly tea house or a shop for comfortable women's shoes.(3) Seems like Hermione withholds information from Ron just to see him beg.06/06/2020 - 68%(1) '""Women!"" [Harry] muttered angrily.'- Well, that's what you get for dating your student.(2) ""Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky.""- Teatime's a bit early for firewhiskey.(3) Hermione: ""Harry, you’re worse than Ron... Well, no, you’re not.""- Ron, still champion of not being able to read girls' romantic signals.06/07/2020 - 70%(1) Harry to Snape: ""Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that.""- It's misdirection. Have the villains all do one thing and cast doubt on an ally by having him do the same.(2) Trelawny: ""You c-can’t sack me! I’ve b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!""Umbridge: ""It was your home.""- Cold-hearted.*character limitClick here for the rest","Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry’s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like “We can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing, and we’ve been doing A LOT. But don’t worry, we’ll see you soon, we just can’t tell you when”? As if he hasn’t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what’s going on, it’s Harry. Doesn’t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does? And that’s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn’t infallible. James Potter isn’t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn’t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that’s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George’s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don’t get the sense that Sirius’s death was a righteous one. You don’t get resolution. He didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don’t necessarily ""enjoy"" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest","“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a seat cause we bloody need to talk about trans lives.""I love Harry Potter as much as anyone, which is why I urge everyone who spends money on these books to also support the trans community.To say it with the author's words: “If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” Well.Here’s a list of organisations that support trans lives (feel free to reach out and recommend more).

I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.""- Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge.06/25/2020 - 6%(1) ""A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.""- How vampire-chic.- Snape's house could use a woman's touch.(2) ""In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.""- I guess she's always in her ""fury"" then.(3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows?06/26/2020 - 9%(1) ""Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.""- Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything.(2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is ""lionlike,"" Petunia has a ""horsey face,"" Vernon has ""piggy eyes,"" etc.06/27/2020 - 13%(1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities.(2) ""The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...""- Again with the animal descriptors.(3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever.06/28/2020 - 17%Harry and Ginny be like, ""I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.""(1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents.(2) ""Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.""- Already giving each other married couple signals.(3) Hermione: ""I know I failed everything!""06/29/2020 - 20%(1) Fred to Ginny: ""Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?""- Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose.(2) '""Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,"" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.'- I presume ""hooter"" means something different in British English.06/30/2020 - 23%(1) '""She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,"" Fleur mused.'- Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks.(2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible.07/01/2020 - 26%Ginny be like: ""Get a room you two.""(1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her.(2) Nearly Headless Nick: ""I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.""Ron: ""That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.""- Ron again with the common sense.07/02/2020 - 29%Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair!(1) Snape: ""We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter.""Harry: ""Yes.""Snape: ""Yes, sir.""Harry: ""There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.""- New levels of reckless sass.(2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny.- Not exactly subtle.07/03/2020 - 33%(1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it.(2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel.(3) Dumbledore: ""The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.""- Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians.07/04/2020 - 36%(1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious.(2) Harry: ""But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?""- Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite.07/05/2020 - 39%Callback/Mirroring: You've got something on your face.(1) Harry: ""The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.""- Oh the irony.(2) Hermione: ""Ron, what are you staring at?""Ron: ""Nothing.""Hermione: ""I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.""- Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old.07/06/2020 - 42%(1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang?(2) Orphanage matron: ""He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.""- Hmm... The Great Marvolo!(3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny.07/07/2020 - 44%(1) Harry: ""What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?""- Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing.(2) ""What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?""- Classic third-wheel talk right there.07/08/2020 - 46%(1) Harry: ""Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.""Ginny: ""Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.""- Can't fault the logic.(2) Ginny teases Ron for ""never snogg[ing] anyone in his life."" She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess.07/09/2020 - 48%Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot.(1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.""- Ron's not wrong, but misses the point.(2) Hermione: ""He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less.""- She sure talks about it a lot for not caring.07/10/2020 - 49%(1) '""Are you going out with [Cormac], then?"" asked Parvati, wide-eyed.""Oh — yes — didn't you know?"" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.'- I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes.(2) Harry: ""Serves you right for coming with [Cormac].""Hermione: ""I thought he'd annoy Ron most.""- I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance.07/11/2020 - 51%(1) ""Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.""- Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing.(2) ""Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.""07/12/2020 - 53%Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro!(1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts.(2) '""Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.'- Most romantic maggot scene in fiction?07/13/2020 - 56%(1) ""Abstinence"" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly.(2) Harry: ""Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?""Hermione: ""No, I can't... So don't even ask.""- Can't or won't?(3) ""The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?""- Eh, only the regrettable ones.07/14/2020 - 58%(1) Hermione: ""Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?""- It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying ""Won-Won."" Sarcasm, yes, but ""Won-Won"" regardless.(2) ""Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.""- The buck stops at ""Lav-Lav""!07/15/2020 - 60%Poor Lavender :((1) Hermione: ""Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.""- That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it!(2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :)07/16/2020 - 62%(1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.""- I vote Lavender.(2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.""- Pretty passive ambition there.07/17/2020 - 64%(1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?""Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?""Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me!

The Fellowship of the Ring,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.40,"Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's 
The Broken Sword
, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock’s 
Epic Pooh
 and Mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. He’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions","Never have I been so sad to give a low rating to such a revered book. I'm so sorry. I can't tell you how sorry I am.Again, I'm so sorry, but I found this book unbelievably dull. I really am so, so sorry. I'm desperately sad about this. This series has been such a foundation for modern-day fantasy that I'm incredibly disappointed in myself for not liking this. I have always wanted to be a Tolkien fangirl. I've always wanted to learn Elvish and get completely offended à la Stephen Colbert but I can't. I just can't. I want so desperately to love Tolkien, but it just ain't happening. I've been trying this book for 17 years. Tolkien and I have a sad history. I've always been a book lover, when I was young, I would persist through any book, no matter how trying. The Hobbit was the first book that made me fall asleep. It's memorable to me because that's the first time, and only the second time it's ever happened. The other book that made me fall asleep? You guessed it. The Fellowship of the Ring. I tried The Fellowship in 10th grade. I couldn't get past Bilbo's birthday party. I tried it again almost 10 years ago when I was stuck in bed for several days due to, oh, a giant surgical wound in my neck. My doctor said I had to stay in bed for a few days. So, I reasoned, what better way than to resume my attempt at reading one of the greatest literary classics of all time than whole having no other option?Audiobook it was! I didn't last past Tom Bombadil before I decided, fuck this, I'm going to head to the gym with a bloody bandage on my neck. True story. I got a lot of really weird looks. My doctor gave me a prescription for Vicodin because he was concerned the pain would be too much to bear. Apparently, I didn't even need the Vicodin because that pedophile Tom Bombadil put me right to sleep.Seriously, were it not for the fact that it is written by Tolkien, I would have hated this book. It was so unbelievably dull. There were parts, that to a Tolkien amateur like me, didn't have a whit of relevance or anything interesting to add to the plot (namely, say, the first 700 pages of the book). Seriously, what the fuck is up with the farmer and Tom Bombadil?The plot was all sorts of disjointed. Some parts just didn't make any sense. Tolkien is a linguist at heart, and it shows, because all the famous quotes we know from him are just sound bytes. In context, sometimes they don't really make any sense. All the poems and songs are in there to sound pretty, and frankly, they bored the fuck out of me.For instance, in the middle of a serious dinner party where the company is just trying to decide what to do about the ring (surely a simple task), all of a sudden little Frodo stands up and solemnly announces.
All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king
I was like what the fuck, man?! Where did that come from? It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the scene. Oh, sure, it's an inside thing on how Aragorn was the secret king, but nobody knew that! Everyone, elf, hobbit, dwarf, (and me) would have thought he was completely high on some elven grass.Let me make this clear: I do not, for an instance, doubt Tolkien's literary value. I think he has been an inspiration to generations of writers, artists, hell, gamers. My beloved World of Warcraft game featured elves, pretty much every fantasy book we have these days have been inspired in one way or another by Tolkien. Again, he was an amazing linguist, his work developing the Elvish tongue, among others, as well as his efforts in developing the rich, fantastic history of the world within his books is not to be disregarded by any means.But again, he is a linguist. He is a scholar. He may be the most brilliant one of those in the world, an inspiration to generations, but for me, personally, his writing is not to my tastes.But damn, the movies were amazing!","As a single lady myself, I also love to put a ring on it. And shoutout to my homegurl Sauron!!! you go girl take over middle earth! Reach for the stars! With that balrog on your side you can do anything!That main dude Frodo tho... reminds me of dat boi Harry... besides what does he need the ring for??Anyways I gotta give it a low rating cuz theres 2 much frodo, not enough orcs"
A Court of Thorns and Roses,Sarah J. Maas,4.17,"(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.
The Writing
The title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to ""dance"" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.
The Worldbuilding
The Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.
The Characters
Faerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.
Conclusion
While I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.","That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind. Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly. This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf. Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, because it takes all the important themes out and leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section. 2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse). The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical. How is that a punishment at all? She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village. However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed. In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery. So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt. She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here. She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior. Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever. The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity. Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away. Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre. She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc. If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous. Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack* Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever. The result is that the danger does not feel genuine. It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin. Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section. And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is not Shatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha? I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.) Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle. This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love. The answer is love. How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle? She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it. Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her. It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird. People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it. Second of all, if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing. Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse. 🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.

Let's see2.5 stars, a true guilty pleasureMy review of ACOMAFMy review of ACOWAR___I'm having major FOMO so I guess it's time to read this? 🤷 Anyway, I need a good cry, so SJM is the right way to go.","Clearly I'm in the minority here. DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions of Beauty and the Beast that I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I felt Cruel Beauty among other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like ""ooooooh, so that's why ____."" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book. Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here's this version of Beauty and the Beast, a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely, from the little that I have read.There's Feyre who has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.
“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”
A life for a life! Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right? WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.
“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”
So what?! Why?! This makes no sense at all. Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother. In exchange, there is absolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.
Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.
Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape. It doesn't make any sense!
 “There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”
Over and over and over, the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.
“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.
And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.
“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”
And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.
“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”
Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.
“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”
As I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue."
Six of Crows,Leigh Bardugo,4.47,"Edit update or whatever I watched the Netflix show I'm on episode four and oh my god it's really good. It's really really fun and I can feel my brain leaking out of my ears whenever I see Inej and Kaz interact with each other. __________________________Five solid stars. This book pulled me in from the beginning, to the point where I knew I'd found a favorite before I was halfway through. Here, Bardugo integrates a creative plot, interesting and morally grey characters, group dynamics and banter, a great writing style, and some really, really prime romance plots. Goddamn, can Leigh Bardugo write romance. There are very, very few books that I love so wholeheartedly. This series truly is my favorite fantasy series of all time. There's no competition whatsoever. PLOTTING AND WORLDBUILDINGBardugo tosses you right into the main plot from the beginning and keeps you engaged all the way through, even when her focus is on character work. Her plotting is incredibly engaging, with so many twists and turns that the book is hard to put down. This book focuses on mind games and clever plotting. The dregs need to have a thousand backup plans, and everything is brilliantly planned by Bardugo. The Grisha's worldbuilding is very engaging, even though we're thrown in without context; I remember thinking that I would have appreciated a proper map of Ketterdam, and then we GOT a good map in book two! Bardugo's prose is awesome, and there are some truly gorgeous quotes from here. Then again, it doesn't feel as if she's trying too hard or using purple prose. CHARACTER WORK OF PERFECTION
A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.
Bardugo nails character work here. Every single character grows, every single character develops, every single character owns my heart. okay maybe not Matthias quite as much but w/eInej is a member of a gang and a murderer, but she desperately wants to do the right thing and liberate slaves like herself. She's gone through hell and she's come out strong and in control. She feels so real on page; she has a heart but she only lets it out around the people she cares about. I like that combination. Kaz is the most manipulative, terrible, morally black protagonist I've ever read about, and I love him to pieces. He's absolutely an antihero; yes, he's on a mission to save the world, but does he care about saving the world? Nope, he cares about getting his cash. He still manages to be a complex, dimensional character, who genuinely cares about his friends not dying (though he'd never admit it). Jesper is witty and an absolute delight to get a POV chapter from, but he's also incredibly sympathetic as a former farm boy who fell from grace. He likes living on the edge, and he's aware of the pain his own actions have caused him, and he's trying to work through it. Nina is hilarious and idealistic and clever and can go from flirting to making speeches within ten seconds. She's such a great character because she's so earnest and positive despite everything that's happened to her. She's also one of the most badass characters ever.  Wylan doesn't actually have pov chapters here, but he's getting a shoutout from me anyway because of his pov chapters in CK. He's entertaining here, too, coming off as a blushing do-gooder but with rumor and intrigue swirling around his actual past. Matthias is honestly my least favorite. He's dynamic enough and he's got a great character arc, but I don't feel as if he's nearly as original a character as my five. Whatever, I still like him. BANTER AND DOING CHARACTER DYNAMICS RIGHTThe Dregs are such an amazing squad all together. Their banter owns my heart. Jesper and Inej especially have one of my favorite friendship dynamics of all time; their banter and their genuine trust in each other and their lowkey joking about their mutual crush on Kaz. Inej and Nina stand out as well; extra credit for passing the bechdel test with flying colors. Also, the dialogue here absolutely rules. You have no idea how many times I had to hold in laughter. 
“When we get our money, you can burn kruge to keep you warm,” said Kaz. “Let’s go.”Jesper consulted his compass, and they turned south. “I’m going to pay someone to burn my kruge for me.”Kaz fell into step beside him. “Why don’t you pay someone else to pay someone to burn your kruge for you? That’s what the big players do.”“You know what the really big bosses do? They pay someone to pay someone to …”
HOW TO WRITE ROMANCE: A GUIDEBOOK BY LEIGH BARDUGOSeriously, I felt the need to give this an entire section of its own, because the romance here is SO good. But the romance plots never overtake the book; I have an annotations list for these books, and there are twice as many good character moments and gorgeous quotes as there are romantic moments. Kaz and Inej are one of my all-time favorite book couples. I used to consider them my third favorite, but they've quickly become my favorite of all time. They have so many small moments and such slow-build romantic development. And then, as if I weren't invested already, they have that one declaration scene which honestly made me swoon. 
I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.
Jesper and Wylan are just cute for most of the book. They got some cute relationship build, but I wasn't that invested. And then that One Line at the end of the book shows up and they KILLED me. Really, Bardugo? You could've left me heart intact instead, but?? not so much. Also, side note, but I don't understand how anyone was surprised they're a thing in book two. I know heteronormativity is a thing that exists, but how can you read ""not just girls"" and mutual blushing in a heterosexual way? Matthias and Nina were honestly not that big a ship for me here. I absolutely understand what's appealing about their dynamic; they're sweet and have amazing relationship development. But they don't appeal to me personally; I don't have to lie down for twenty minutes when I read their scenes. DIVERSITY: YOUR FAVE COULD NEVERSomething that gets ignored a lot is how diverse this series is; not just in terms of nonwhite characters, lgbt characters, and badass girl characters, although it does have all of those. But Six of Crows also has some of the best rep of a disabled character EVER. It helps that this is ownvoices disability rep. Kaz' disability affects his life in a realistic way, and there's no magical cure for it, BUT he's still a huge badass and the disability never becomes a consuming part of his character!! There's also the fact that a chubby main character is portrayed as the most beautiful member of the group, while also not being reduced to her appearance. There's even a dyslexic character (in FANTASY!) and part of his character arc is learning that his learning difference doesn't make him stupid. There's a major character with ADD as well. This series handles emotional and physical trauma in the best way. Some of these characters have trauma and it's never portrayed as a detriment to who they are as people. It's an aspect of who they are as people, but their background never takes over their characters. It's a balance. Recovery is also portrayed in a great way; none of these characters can be ""fixed"" but that's okay. The entire topic is handled in a better way than most contemporaries that focus entirely on trauma. I appreciate it so much. TL;DR: I was never bored by this book, and I love the characters more than my own life. Highly recommended.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | YoutubeA Bunch of Random Spoilery Notes / CryingUPDATE: I actually got my mother obsessed with my favorite book? in related news I still have to lie down for 40 hours whenever Kaz and Inej interact// three chapters into reading this with my mother and she says ""it's official: I'm in love with Kaz"" and honestly if that isn't the mood for today• remember when we all thought Wylan had gotten kicked out for banging his tutor? is it even canonically confirmed that he didn't? i need answers• I BRed a second reread of this (yes, I've read it three times, shut up) with Amy, whose review you should definitely check out!!• every single moment of banter is my favorite but my underrated fave is probably ""If I see a single scratch or nick on those, I'll spell 'forgive me' on your chest in bullet holes"" and the ensuing debate over whether 'I'm sorry' would be better• ""Close your eyes!"" ""You can't kiss me from down there, Wylan.""• or maybe it's ""my ghost won't associate with your ghost"" • every time Kaz and Inej interact I have to lie down for 40 hours• Jesper and Wylan are probably angstier in this book than book 2?• I don't even understand how it's possible not to love this book. With most of my faves, I love them, but I get it if you don't love them. I flat-out don't understand how anyone could not love this book. It's a masterpiece.","Side effects of reading Six of Crows are, but not limited to: Shortness of breath. Heart palpitations. Nausea. Weak knees. Dehydration. Dizziness. Headache. Heartache. Constant sweating. High blood-pressure. Congestive heart failure. “The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true.”Six of Crows is 185th book I've read this year. Yes, that means this is the book that put me at my goodreads reading goal this year. I am so happy that this is the book that made me hit my mark. It was the perfect book to reach my goal with. The world has been shouting, praying, and calling for diverse reads... Leigh Bardugo has answered. I liked but didn't love the Shadow and Bone trilogy, but it has nothing on this novel. With how much hype is surrounding this book I was oh so worried about reading it. However if Six of Crows isn't my top pick for the year, it will without a doubt at least be in the top five. It was amazing.SoC is a novel with six main characters, depending on how you look at it five plus perspectives, breath-taking flashbacks, seamless world building, and twists that will make your tits drop.""A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who has become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.""A direct quote and the most perfect sum up of the characters. Each one is so different from the other. Each one is a different race, different background, and has so many layers. Each one has a handful of amazing different aspects, and things about them that will constantly surprise you. I can't believe I'm about to say this but... Squad goals! We have Nina this wild-loud-in your face-curvy firecracker who will have you in stitches. Matthias who is this perfectly wounded warrior who will surprise the crap out of you. Wylan who is this lovable nerdy cutie-pie that had me blushing for days. Jesper the comic relief. And then there are my two favorites... Kaz and Inej. Ahh just loved these two so much. These two gave me everything I wanted in characters and more. Inej background story is lovey, her physical appearance sounds both breathtaking and unique, and her set of skills are completely bad-ass. She is basically a freaking ninja. Oh God, and the stories and quotes from her father!!! Break my heart why dontcha.“Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you'll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won't matter because he will have taken the time to know you as no one else does. Only that boy earns you heart.”Kaz though. Oh Kaz! He was my favorite of favorites. His thought, his flashbacks, his story, his composure, his street smarts, his everything. I have none-zero-zip-nada complaints about him. How did Leigh managed to give us such a naughty character, make him have a limp, ""force"" him to wear gloves all the time, and still managed to have me swoon over him was beyond me. I want to have his babies. His bad-ass babies. I really have no complaints character wise. All these characters and their personal stories will shock and then steal your heart. Each will give you a taste of who they are and what they have become and it is truly stunning. I need to shut up about them before I spill all their secrets (which I really want to do right about now). I do really want to comment on my favorite part of this book. This is something that others might have over looked, but it is something that meant a lot to me. That's Inej and Nina's friendship. They aren't two girls that hate each other then become friends. They aren't two women who see each other as fierce competition or having to fight over a man. These two women see each other as equals AND THAT is how all women should see each other. Real women pick each other up not tear each other down. I don't think people realize how important that truly is. This needs to be highlighted in more books. Even if the characters would have faltered (they don't) it wouldn't have mattered because the plot and world building are so solid. I heard a few people/reviews say the ""middle of the book is kind of slow""... WHAT THE F ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?!?? Every part of this book is flawless and demands your respect. There wasn't a moment I wasn't on the edge on my seat. Leigh gives you all these twist and turns without leaving you guessing on what your surrounding look like. She's built a world with so many stunning features. SoC is go go go, nonstop action novel that wont let you up for air. It is a roller-coaster ride of emotions and Wtf just happened moments. The first three parts of this book set the bait out, parts four and five has you snapping for the treat, and part six hooks and pulls you in. My jaw was on the floor for 99% of this book. 

You might think you know what coming, BUT YOU WILL BE WRONG! So many well planned out plot  twist. So many ground shaking moments. So many heart crushing scenes. And that ending!!!! YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO PEOPLE!!! You can't leave us hanging like this!!!! OMG and I didn't even get to mention the romance!!!! I want to talk about it. Oh goodness do I want to talk about it! But I wont, and if you've ever read any of my review you know this is unheard of. I love love and not wanting to talk about it must only mean one thing... That it's really really good! Even with the massive amount to sexual tense and stolen glances it still doesn't even overshadow the plot. I'm not just talking about the romance with a certain pair, I'm talking romance among several. Like I can't even believe how much gooey lovey dovey moments she gives us and yet didn't drown us in it. Perfect just perfect.This book was EVERYTHING it was hyped up to be. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love, and I have been left a mess.




This review was a lot longer than I ever imagine it would be. It is filled with cut off and run on sentences... I don't care either. I just had to get my jumbled thoughts down. This book is epic and everything. I already want to re-read it and I could quote it all day long. If Arrow wasn't coming on in a few I would just keep going on about it. If you read Six of Crows and didn't like it then there's only one thing to say about you... You have bad taste.Edit: can people please start fancasting the shit out of this!!!! I want a movie or tv show like now. ThanksDouble edit: my wish was granted.","AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.^ That’s me screaming.This has been: my full review of Six of Crows. Bye.I guess I can elaborate on that, but really it’s going to boil down to the same thing. Which is me screaming.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I’m only, like, 17% joking. I have no idea how to review this book. I barely even knew how to read this book, due to the fact that it was so devastatingly cool and exciting and unique and addictive that it almost made me illiterate.When I first read this book, I loved it. Absolutely aDORED it. I five-starred it and participated in the hype and probably googled fan art exactly one time, which is as far as I ever get in terms of joining a fandom.However. That guaranteed absolutely nothing.As I have said 3467824628 times, any opinion of mine older than approximately 18 months cannot be trusted. I am on a continual process of growth and I am very stupid. Here is where I always list a hot take younger me had (such as thinking the television program ""Degrassi"" was the apex of cinematic art), or something dumb younger me did (such as literally never eat a salad even once), in order to illustrate just how stupid that was.This is the person who read and loved Six of Crows.That version of me was also #new to the book-internet scene and, ahem, DESPERATE TO FIT IN. I think I initially four-starred A Court of Thorns and Roses despite not liking it at all just to seem Hip and Down With The Teens. Obviously I went back and surreptitiously changed that rating. Anyway, what it’s coming down to is that it’s absolutely possible that then-me could have tricked myself into liking this book just out of a desperate desire for popularity, and that even if I did actually like it it wouldn’t matter because I was (and continue to be) a fool.Luckily, THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.This book is fan-f*cking-tastic. It blows all other YA fantasy out of the water (okay except The Raven Cycle I see you Maggie Stiefvater I would never forget about you Gansey).It’s everything the genre should be. It’s creative and immersive and unique. It’s stylistically great without being overly stylized. The plotline is nearly nonstop exciting. There is a MAP. Nearly most importantly of all, there is a HEIST. Everyone who’s anyone knows that the best trope-y plotline is a heist. We get squads and excitement and scheming and risk and THEFT. And just yesterday someone asked me earnestly if I’m a kleptomaniac, to which, after a bit of reflection, I answered “Yes.”But there is a lil thing I mentioned in there that I need to talk more about. And it’s not my potential kleptomania. (Although maybe I should talk more about that too. In a different format.)That thing is: THE SQUAD!!!!The characters in this book are so fantastic. Our gang is made up of six people, whom I will now list here as if it’s even slightly possible that anyone hasn’t read this book yet. They are: Kaz, Inej, Jesper, Wylan, Nina, Matthias.Is that a ranking? I don’t know. You decide. (Yes it is a ranking.)I LIKE THREE OF THOSE CHARACTERS. THREE!! OUT OF SIX!!! To anyone else that may sound like a fairly low number. You know. Fifty percent. A failing grade. But I’ve always been a glass-half-full kind of person, and by “always” I mean “exclusively in this exact scenario for the sake of my argument.”What it comes down to is the fact that I rarely truly like even a single character in a book. So to like THREE!! IN ONE NOVEL! Unbelievable.Kaz is a dark nightmare boy who threatens to be a Hot Boy With A Tragic Backstory And So He Is Allowed To Be Mean To Everyone Especially Girls He Likes And You Can’t Say Anything About It, but he subverts that trope gorgeously. (By which I mean: Leigh Bardugo is the queen of YA, and also literature and being a person in general.)Inej is a spooky lil sneaky gal who climbs around stuff and is the single most powerful creature in all of fictional humankind. Also Inej is just a cool name. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK AND ITS WORLDBUILDING IS COOL.Jesper is a hilarious f*cked up lil monster who is trying his damn best and being a sarcastic sweetheart while he’s at it. Plus shooting at stuff, which adds some excitement and flair to the whole thing.The other three...they’re just pretty boring. Wylan is Nice but that’s not enough to make me like a character. Nina is just like “Food!!! Yum!!! Love to eat, and also be sexy!!!” And if anyone could show me actual proof Matthias has one (1) trait besides liking Nina and being strong, I’d fall out of my chair. Because I’d be surprised. And also statistically speaking I’d probably be sitting.BUT ANYWAY this is a five star review and that means I don’t have to complain!!! Who knew!! All new to me.This book united stupid me and current me, which means that people who are dumb and have bad taste and people who are very very cool and like good things only can be united in liking this book.It is literally so good that it’s impossible to not like it, even if you’re an idiot or picky. PICKY IDIOTS: UNITE!!!Bottom line: Can anyone give me Leigh Bardugo’s mailing address? Not for anything creepy, I just want to blow a kiss into an envelope and ship it to her.Oh, that is creepy? Got it. I would still like that address though.--PRE-REVIEWREREADING THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST DECISION I'VE MADE IN RECENT MEMORY.and just last night, i decided to rewatch Fantastic Mr. Fox while eating peanut butter cup ice cream. so that's a high bar.review to come!!--CURRENTLY-READING UPDATESme: okay. school's amping up. extracurriculars are starting. the internship search is well under way. what should we do first?also me: ...idk sounds like the perfect time to reread Six of Crows imo--this reread brought to you by the generosity of lilywas wondering why i felt sad and realized it's been way too long since i last read six of crows. so this'll probably solve itbuddy reread with my best buddy [reader] and my best mate innit"
Mistborn: The Final Empire,Brandon Sanderson,4.49,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoHere it is, the beginning of the trilogy that sparked my love for reading fantasy novels.It’s been exactly one year ten months since I first joined Goodreads or started reading The Final Empire for the first time; it was on September 1st, 2016. There’s no doubt that The Final Empire is an extremely important book for me. It’s not easy for me to elaborate upon this; a cliché such as “I absolutely love this book” is not enough, and the reason behind the significance of this trilogy for me will have to be postponed until I’m done with rereading The Hero of Ages. The impact that this trilogy left on my life is immeasurable, and my life before and after I finished this trilogy for the first time is a different one from each other. I predict this will happen within a week or two from now, but for now, let’s talk about The Final Empire, and why—even upon reread—it’s an absolutely incredible start to a trilogy.Picture: The Final Empire by breath-artThe Final Empire is the first book in Brandon Sanderson’s highly acclaimed Mistborn trilogy. For a thousand years, the world has been ruled with an iron fist by the immortal emperor: Lord Ruler. The main plot of the book revolves around a rebellion to overthrow the lord ruler; this rebellion is built around a heist led by Kelsier, his team, and his newly found apprentice—Vin. I immensely enjoyed reading The Final Empire; the first time I read this novel, I found the plot to be thoroughly engaging, relatable, and at times humorous due to the character’s camaraderie and banter. And I was also completely fascinated by the world-building and magic system that Sanderson has created here. On reread, all of these are still true, but there’s a new additional superb quality: all the foreshadowing and hints are now laid bare for me to see with the gift of hindsight. The Final Empire, on its own, works perfectly as a standalone, but trust me that there’s so much more to the story beyond this book. Everything you read here—even the mini details—played major parts in the upcoming sequels.

""Plots behind plots, plans behind plans. There was always another secret.”

Picture: Kelsier and Vin by GisAlmeidaWhere should I even begin with the wonderful characterizations? I guess I’ll start with Vin. I’ve read more than 200 books since the first time I finished reading this trilogy, and Vin—by the end of the trilogy—still stands strong as one of my favorite heroines of all time. This, of course, doesn’t mean that Vin was the only great character from the series; Kelsier, Sazed, Elend, and many other characters were so memorable as well. I can’t mention them all in this review because their greatness hasn’t occurred yet here. Ever since I read this book for the first time, I’ve heard from several readers that they found Vin to be incredibly emo and annoying; I disagree with this. Vin had a rough past. I think Sanderson did a great job in conveying Vin’s insecurity and emotions. Vin’s thoughts felt believable to me, and I found her character’s development to be amazing. She taught me that despite being betrayed and left behind countless times, it’s always okay—and better—to love and trust someone again rather than being alone. And then Kelsier taught me about the meaning of justice and hope; it’s not okay to stand still in the face of tyranny, oppression, and slavery.

“Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.”

Sazed taught me that differences in faith can still lead to being respectful and kind towards each other’s beliefs.

“Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.”

There were plenty of things to learn from the character’s actions in the book. But for now, I want to discuss the next highlight of the novel—and trilogy—itself: the magic system.The Final Empire introduced us to Allomancy and Feruchemy. Honestly speaking, coming from a gaming and manga/anime background, I thought I would never encounter a magic system as good as the one often told in these two mediums within a novel format. However, I was proven wrong. Allomancy is amazing, and it’s still by far my favorite magic system in the entire fantasy genre. Yes, I think it’s even better than the one shown in Sanderson’s magnum opus—The Stormlight Archive—so far. The intricacy of the magic system that Sanderson has crafted in Mistborn Saga never ceased to amaze me, and I’ve yet to encounter a more engaging, complex, and amazingly easy-to-understand magic system in any other fantasy novels. Plus, the actions spawned from the magic system resulted in some incredibly vivid and fast-paced battle sequences.This book was also my first encounter with Sanderson’s spectacular world-building. Accompanied with Sanderson’s accessible, vivid, and immersive prose, the world of Scadrial that’s clouded by ash and surrounded by mist felt extremely atmospheric to read. There was also a lot of well-built mystery and lore within this book; Sanderson used the epigraph at the beginning of each chapter masterfully. I’ve heard a lot of criticisms from several readers that Sanderson’s prose can be a bit too simple to their liking, and I can certainly agree that—not only this book—all of his books contain simplistic prose. However, that’s actually one of the things that I appreciate about his works. His writings never get in the way of the story, and he’s brilliantly capable of telling a story of epic proportion with his accessible writing style. And this doesn’t mean that the narrative is lacking in wisdom or impact. In my opinion, all of Sanderson’s books in the Cosmere universe contained a lot of relatable wisdom easily applicable to our daily life. A few examples:

“The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit however, can suffocate.”

or this

“You should try not to talk so much, friend. You'll sound far less stupid that way”

And with that quote, I realized that it’s time for me to put an end to my review here. It’s safe to say that I still consider The Final Empire as one of my favorite books and one of my favorite starts to a trilogy. My reread experience of this book has been better than I expected, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the trilogy will hold up for me. Below here—just for fun, cringe, and nostalgia factors—is the first review I’ve ever written.

The book have an amazing world-building, great characters development and most of all, very intricate magic system and actions. This is coming from someone who've seen plenty of magics (not real of course) from 20 years of gaming and watching anime/movie/television series. The amount of details Sanderson put into each words (not to mention it's really simple and easy to understand) is insane.I will definitely read the rest of the trilogy straight after this and more works by him!","I can't remember being this violently conflicted about a book in quite some time. There are some areas where it's so incredibly well done, with the author absolutely nailing it, and then others where I found myself grinding my teeth in frustration. I'm going to abandon my usual practice of writing short, pithy reviews and just drunkenly ramble on a few things here. (Still no spoilers, though.) That OK with y'all?Language. About two and a half chapters into this book, I found myself asking, ""Why does this feel like a YA fantasy book?"" It wasn't the subject material or the plot, both of which are much more sophisticated than Harry Potter and his ilk. While I would feel perfectly comfortable having a 12-year-old read this PG13-violent and utterly asexual book, I don't feel as though it's necessarily written for tweens. Finally it occurred to me: it's the language. This book is one of the most simply written books I've ever read, using only the most basic vocabulary. That isn't a bad thing, as I'd rather read something direct and simple than something flowery and overwritten, but Sanderson's language is so simple here that it's almost as if he's drawing with the Crayola 16-set when other authors have the big 64. (One notable exception: having apparently become recently enamored of the word, he uses maladroitly at least three times. Maybe he was jamming some Weezer while he wrote.) I haven't read any of his other works (yet; Mistborn #2 is on deck), but I have to assume this simplicity is by conscious choice, and it's an interesting choice at that. I'm just not sure yet how I feel about it.One language choice that I am sure how I feel about is Sanderson's decision to have his characters speak good old American English. The narration is similarly plainspoken, with a fair amount of American slang thrown in, rather than the twee, faux-Elizabethan style of a lot of fantasy authors. I like the approach. One of the most time-honored fantasy tropes is having all the characters thee and thou each other, with a few ne'er did yon stars of Yomama glimmer so resplendently, my suzerain for good measure. And I can handle that stuff, having been weaned on Tolkien and everything that came after, but I found Sanderson's decision to move away from that convention refreshing. I interpreted it as Sanderson saying, ""The unspoken assumption here is that this book has been translated from whatever languages they speak on this made-up world, so why translate it to anything other than what is most understandable and comfortable for you to read? To couch this story in funky language is to insult your imagination by implying that you need that in order to realize you're reading a fantasy novel.""Setting and Plot. The setting is a typical high fantasy world - feudal-style nobility and peasantry; shadowy, powerful priesthood; mysterious evil lord, etc. - with some odd, almost steampunk flourishes thrown in. There are wristwatches. Men's formal wear is described as something more like Victorian coat and tails than medieval garb. Magic in this world is fueled by elemental and alloyed metals, which are described rather precisely, using percentages. It's a unique and interesting blend.The basic plot is about as stock as it gets. If you're familiar with the Star Wars films, the Harry Potter or Percy Jackson books, Eragon, the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy, Dune, Ender's Game, or any one of about a million other works, please play Mad Libs with me:Dear [kid with weird name], I know you are only a [farmer / orphan / urchin / child of a minor noble], and this will be hard for you to accept, but you [have Great Powers / are the Chosen One / insert name of funky power here]. You are the only one who can [save the world / save the universe / defeat the Empire / restore order to the Force / kill the Big Boss]. Luckily, even though you just learned your destiny fifteen minutes ago, you will make up for lost time by quickly becoming better than anyone in the history of ever at [Quidditch / dragon riding / sandworm riding / Allomancy]. Any questions?Needless to say, the plot could have been a one-way express ticket to Hack City, but it really isn't. Vin's growth and development are handled well.Exposition. This is a fantasy book for the video game generation. By that, I mean that the book follows the general path of a first-person RPG:1) Introduction to the world and the main characters2) A few early levels whose only apparent purpose is to teach the player how to use the buttons3) Quests of increasing difficulty, with progressive reveals of the Big Plot4) Fight with the Main Boss, including the inevitable twist5) Denouement and teaser for the next installment.Not that that's a bad thing! But I was really surprised at the way Allomancy (the main ""magic"" in this world) was laid out. In the two towering fantasy/sci-fi works of the 20th century, The Lord of the Rings and Dune, the supernatural elements of the story operated behind a sort of curtain or screen. The One Ring in LotR and the spice Melange in Dune both held great, mysterious powers, but the specific effects and extent of those powers were seen only in fits and flashes, and never understood completely by the characters or the reader. In contrast, fairly early in this book, Kelsier takes Vin on a practice run where he explains how her powers work and what their advantages and limitations are, using plain language and real-world physics, and lets her fly and mess around and just generally exult in her magic. It left me, the reader, as well as Vin the character, feeling that even if we didn't understand this magic perfectly right now, we might at some point in the future, which was a very different feel.OK, after enough rambling about things I feel ambivalently about, let's wrap up with one big win and one big fail:WIN: Brandon Sanderson can write the hell out of an action scene. (And since the final quarter of this book is pretty much all action, playing directly into Sanderson's strengths, it kicks all kinds of ass.) The fights in this book are gut-wrenching without being overly gory, and the chases and sneaks are heart-stopping as well. Perfect combination of pace and detail. Amazing. Possibly the best I've ever read from an author in this genre, and if he's able to do that so effortlessly, so early in his career, it gives me hope that he can fix...FAIL: ...the dialogue. In spite of being favorably disposed due to the use of informal American English, I eventually found the dialogue here really clunky. Everyone is too wordy. Everyone says one sentence too many. Over and over again, I found myself going, ""Real people don't talk like this,"" and especially, ""Real people who are supposed to be close friends don't talk anything like this to each other."" Seriously, think of how you talk to your best friends in private, then compare it to this book. In addition, there was always that odd feeling of unneeded exposition, as if the characters were talking half to each other and half to the reader. It was unfortunate, especially in contrast to how slick and fast-moving and just plain awesome a lot of the other writing was.All in all, this was a fun, kinetic read...with a few holes in it. It builds, it explodes, and the ending is really good. If half-stars were allowed, this would have been a 3 1/2. Good stuff.Also, here are my (spoiler-free, suitable as previews) reviews of the second and third books in the series, if you enjoyed this one!","6/21 Re-reading...Thank the Lord Ruler I finally crawled out from whatever rock I was living under and finally decided to read this book. Because.It. Was. So. Fucking. Awesome.I have been telling myself for years that I should try and branch out from just romance, paranormal romance, UF romance, sci-fi alien smut and the occasional murder mystery or biography (not that there is a damn thing wrong with my beloved romance, but just to challenge myself to try something new) and attempt to tackle a straight high fantasy. Well, this book was my first true foray into that genre and all I can say is...***LOLZ. Jay kay, peeps, jay kay. Just making sure I live down to your expectations. *wink*In all sincerity though, this book was everything and I truly don't know why I waited so long to tackle this genre. Comic/Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies are my all time FAVORITE movie genres.And this book felt like I was locked in one of them.Like I was in a theater watching an epic fantasy film.Only BETTER.Because we ALL know the book is always better. Brandon Sanderson is now a front runner in the Val's Spirit Animal Games and I just want to sit across from him at a pub table and watch him breathe. His world building is so amazing, I can't even.I was enthralled from page one until page end.This is an older book and and I'm late to the fiesta, so I'll stop there; but long story short, I loved this thing so hard I might sleep with it under my pillow for a while. And the best part?There are now aisles of books at the bookstore that I feel have suddenly been opened to me. AISLES, people. So glad I tried something new.I feel so mature.  Three cheers for Garth."
The Two Towers,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.50,"""'And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?''Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.''So was I,' said Frodo.""just gonna go cry in some small corner now","4.5/5 stars

 “It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.” 

Friendship, hope, resilience, faith, justice, and bravery; these days, good-hearted with no grey morality characters are much easier for fantasy readers to dismiss. I totally get it; this type of characters and stories have been done more than a million times in fantasy stories, and readers—myself included—sometimes prefer more complexity. However, I also personally think that these kinds of characters are still much needed in the stories we devour. Maybe even more than ever. The Two Towers, being the second part of The Lord of the Rings, touches upon these themes by transporting its readers to an old and familiar ground, which I highly enjoyed reading.I’m genuinely surprised by how fast and immersed I am with reading The Two Towers. To be honest, I never expected to find myself compelled from reading most of Tolkien’s work, but I certainly did with this one. This is surprising to me because The Two Towers have often been mentioned as being even slower and tedious than The Fellowship of the Ring by several fans of the series. There’s something about The Two Towers that worked reasonably well with me. To be clear, there’s no clear beginning and ending with this volume, but that’s also why what the characters faced in The Two Towers resonated; they’re doing whatever they can with the hope that their faith towards one another will be rewarded. Many people in this world say and believe that true faith is achieved once you believe in something that you can’t see with your eyes. After what happened at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, the main characters are plagued with doubts on whether they can succeed in completing the journey they set out to do. And yet they persevere. Honestly, what they had was only the faith that everything will maybe turn out alright if they do everything they respectively can do the best.And isn’t that what we all do in our lives?

 “War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” 

I’m also, once again, amazed at the film’s portrayal of the Battle of Helm’s Deep. Now that I’ve read the scene in the original text for the first time, I will say that what the movie did on this sequence was so much more superior to what’s written. I’m not saying that Tolkien’s Battle of Helm’s Deep was poorly written, it’s just that the movie took the best quality of the text and increased the buildup, the tensions, and the execution of the battle dramatically. Picture: The Two Towers by Jonathan BurtonIf there’s one thing that the books do better, it would be the world-building and the characterizations for Faramir and Frodo. Frodo in the movies, in my opinion, was mediocre. I liked Frodo in the book more, and I think Tolkien’s writing of Frodo and Samwise Gamgee’s friendship was wonderfully done; it’s no wonder the movie could execute their friendship to its maximum potential. I’ve been saying this since I first watched the movies, and I will repeat it again that everyone needs a Samwise Gamgee in their life.

'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. ""I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?""''Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.''So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am.” 

As for the parts that didn’t work for me, I’m going to keep this brief by saying that every single scene revolving around Merry, Pippin, Treebeards, and the Ents bored me to oblivion. Thankfully, there aren’t too many of them, but wow they totally tested my patience; their scenes were as painfully slow as the Ent’s communication with each other.Picture: Fangorn Forest by Donato GiancolaOverall, though, despite a few issues, I definitely enjoyed reading The Two Towers more than reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Not going to lie, it helps a lot that there’s no Tom Bombadil’s nonsense here. I only have one more book left, once I’m done reading The Return of the King, it would mean that I’m finally done with Middle-Earth (I’ve read Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and the three Great Tales of Middle-Earth) after all these years.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.","""It’s only a passing thing… this review.

Highly Recommendable.*** LOTR: The Two Towers (2002) is another highly acclaimed masterful adaptation. Just as good as the first one, if not more? Loads of awards too, all rightfully earned. An extended casting with new figures, all faultless; my favorite being Treebeard and the Entmoot. Extremely faithful to the book, although I always remember that the part of the ent-draugh was not included. On the whole, another near perfect adaptation that I enjoyed even more than the first, although less than the last one. Also a movie that I place over the book, having watched it at least a few dozen times, easy. (9/10)-----------------------------------------------

NOTA PERSONAL

A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,4.64,"Rating: All the stars in the universe 


""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.”“You needed not to be alone.”
I don't really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunning A Court of Mist and Fury is. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I'm at a lack of words for describing how it truly made me feel -- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel. 
“But then she snapped your neck.” Tears rolled down his face. “And I felt you die,” he whispered. Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.
This book is a story about life and love and every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth. 

Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I am so so proud of her and who she's become at the end of the novel. She's so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion. 
I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.


I want to assure everyone that not one character, 
NO ONE
, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I'm talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn't jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereas ACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding. This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he's not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we've seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I've said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences. I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre. 
“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”
Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome of damn. I might even have a confession to make... He might... *gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!! 

Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn't realize it. And holy shit his past was just too much -- I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS. 
“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”
And you wanna know what? HE'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn't make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don't know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN'T HE REAL??? *sobs* 


“Tamlin won’t allow it.” “Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—” “You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended— A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""
Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that. Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand's Inner Circle. They're squad goals. Fierce Morrigan; strange and kickass Amren; sassy, arrogant and skilled Cassian; reserved and observant Azriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that creates a family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds of wow and awwww. 

Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let's venture into dangerous territory aka the romance. *deep breath* I want to start by saying there is no love triangle -- there's only 
a wonderful, all-consuming and healthy
 relationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective is the mutual respect, honesty and support they have for each other -- it paints them with an empowering and downright heartwarming glow. Their amazing friendship, their sparking chemistry, their hilarious banter and their hot as hell tension had me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.


“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”
Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overall HOTNESS. Because this book? It's hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot? YOU THOUGHT WRONG -- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, 'cause SJM's writing skills slay in those scenes. 
“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.” I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”
Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they're not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness. And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!  What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling of Beauty and the Beast paling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that's to come, contained a sense of radiant and vast epicness. The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris and 
ohmygod this city
! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I'd want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it. 

Plotwise, there isn't really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar to Heir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word. 
Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.
 It leaves you craving more the very next instant. 

We'll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that's for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It's going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly. A Court of Mist and Fury made me want to re-read it the second I've finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless. 



But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It's in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe of Hades & Persephone and with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment. 


“You are my salvation, Feyre.”
A Court of Mist and Fury is my new favorite book and I'll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you'll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night. 

On a chirpier note though, I'll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing, 
absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind
. ENJOY! <3 P.S.: My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:

Listen here: 8tracks; YouTube.","HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE THIS PERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I'm warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review. May 3rd was the day I died.  I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where's Rhys.And then the moment we've been waiting for happened. The moment where RHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre's first instinct is to throw a shoe at him. THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE. It was adorable. And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them. EVEN RHYS'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn't let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre's new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn't do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn't seem like it because now you've recreated that same cell that's caused her so much trauma. Isn't he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she's become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We've got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor's past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she was MAD. She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby. NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I'M SORRY I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let's talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre. THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He's sacrificed so much for his people like I can't even explain because HE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH. And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself. MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let's talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I'm talking about. So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand's control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I'm like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand's screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin's says ""Do it."". AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT'S NOT OVER. RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON'T THINK I'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!! AND I'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.","When I finished this book, the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.Thanks to my wonderful friends Emer, Reyes and Sarah (click to read their reviews) who helped me up this calvary, with whom I shared joys and sorrows, and who made me laugh so much I probably won't need to swing by the gym for the rest of my life. And a special mention goes to Katerina, Nastassja and Vera (again, click and be delighted by snarkiness), who ranted with me in the comments of more than one update. Thank you. <3(I told you reading this book was so much fun.)---➤ The book, in brief:“Stop comparing. Stop comparing me to him.”Because do you know what it is called when you keep and keep and keep comparing the previous love interest to the current one, and each single one of these sugary, clichéd, obvious and trite comparisons invariably leads to the conclusion that the ex is a prick while the newcomer is a Perfection Milkshake? No, Maas? I thought so. Oh well. I’m going to say this just once: it’s called manipulation. Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why, I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to: don’t read A Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there and start with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me- A Court of Mist and Fury could even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive how caricatural his behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment to overturn completely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book. (In this regard, I should say that in A Court of Thornes and Roses I did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.) In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out, it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should; he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just so stereotypical and trite and sickly sweet.All of this, in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs. I am sick of this device, courtesy of Queen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself. •I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion, nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial. Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming. Simple as that.Besides, I liked Rhysand in this book, but I deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of him that we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off as flat and, at times, pathetic.•It was a dick move to lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering that two chapter later she says this:“I'm thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing -thing? Now he’s a thing?- that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I'm thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn't work for who- what I am now.""She had every right to leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop. It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and the trauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember? His being all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure. •The new characters are all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated. •The plot is even weaker than Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. The My Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi. Well, wrong story, but that's basically what happens. In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first time Rhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, all the sex scenes are very cheesy, dramatic and over-written. •Lucien and Elain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet, I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyed Rhys, Rhys, his long, sappy, teary declaration/explanation (I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would've loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), the ending, and Rhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense. I still prefer him wicked. ➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept of guilty pleasure to a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can't overcome the irritation that Maas's little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I'm wondering if we should expect a third time too. EDIT 29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn't know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find it here.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist go OOC with three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent. Because apparently the whole Queen of Shadows mess wasn't enough.Respect, Maas. Really.EDIT 14/01/16: *braces herself for the incoming tomatoes*I don't like the cover!*runs away as fast as she can*"
The Name of the Wind,Patrick Rothfuss,4.52,"I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfuss. For realz, actual sorry. Honestly. I tried giving your book two stars out of pity, since I so wanted to like it and I'd feel bad about giving it one star and dragging down your average rating. Though you don't appear to need my pity. Your book has the highest average GR rating (4.49) of any of the book I've read. I finally dropped my rating down to one star because it's just a steaming pile of crap and I couldn't take the embarrassment of having posted a two-star rating on something so awful.Mr. Rothfuss, you probably don't give a shit about my rating since, judging from your GR biography, you appear to be very comfortable in your own academic, geeky skin. And that is totally cool. I'm an academic, geeky type myself. Not as geeky as you. You are really geeky. Like I said: that's cool. Anywayz, for a long time I gave you two stars since a couple of my most favorite people (my brother and his fiancé) both love your book. One star for each of them. But, like I hinted, the book is pretty bad. So are you and me good? No hard feelings? Awesome. I don't take shit too personally, either. So now I'll get down to ripping your book, knowing we can still be friends.In the interest of full disclosure, I faithfully admit that this book goes in my DNF shelf. I made it 162 pages in (I was reading it on the Kindle app on my iPhone and made it to § 3154, but with little arithmetic I determined that was the equivalent of page 162 in the mass market paperback). I just couldn't finish it. I gave it a good honest try and eventually found myself reading only so I wouldn't have to admit to my brother that I didn't like it enough to finish. But that isn't a good reason to spend my time—something we have precious little of in our short lives—reading something I dislike and not getting paid for it. So I'm sorry, bro. I tried. (Yes, my brother is one of my GR friends and will likely see this review.) Now on to the reasons I couldn't finish the book.Most of The Name of the Wind is written in the first person; it's the autobiography of Kvothe, who has a number of things in common with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Kvothe is reciting his life story to a scribe while his male companion, Bast, looks on.FOOTNOTEThere are several interesting facts pertaining to Kvothe and Bast. First, Bast is described as ""sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes."" Second, Kvothe and Bast run a bed-and-breakfast. Third, Bast follows Kvothe around like a puppy dog. Fourth, Bast likes to tuck Kvothe into bed and watch him sleep. Fifth, Bast cries like a little girl when he hears something sad. Finally, Bast apparently can manifest himself as some sort of goat-man creature. Do you see where I'm going with this? Kvothe runs a bed-and-breakfast, in which a very sensitive and beautiful man follows him around and occasionally turns into a goat. Bed-and-breakfast and goat-men: what could be sexier? Not that there's anything wrong with that. I believe everyone should have the freedom be who they were born to be and I have several close friends who happen to be gay; I'm the last person who would have a problem with Kvothe and his beautiful male companion getting frisky (goat-style, of course). I only mention the implied homoerotic connection because Kvothe (a.k.a. The Most Interesting Man in the World) is supposed to be a lady-killer. No, not a psycho rapist murderer, you freaks. A lady-killa. A Lover of Women. I suppose that's not necessarily inconsistent; perhaps Kvothe swings both ways. Let's all say it together, now: not that there's anything wrong with that.END FOOTNOTENot all of the book, however, is written in the first-person. First-person narrative is reserved for Kvothe's recitation of his life story. The remainder of the book, particularly the scenes of Kvothe manhandling his lover in front of the scribe (Bast said Kvothe leaves bruises), are written in the third-person. I'll address my displeasure with the third-person sections first.Let me clarify at the outset that I have no problem with the writer switching between first-person and third-person narrative. I recognize it can be a powerful tool and it serves the structure of this story quite well. The book begins in the third-person, then as Kvothe tells his life story it switches to first-person, then back to third-person for occasional interludes. My problem is with the author switching his narrative voice within the third-person sections. The academic geek is all over the place in that regard. Sometimes he writes a scene in third-person subjective, other times third-person objective. Some passages read like third-person limited, others third-person omniscient. At points the author seemed to switch voice page to page, or even paragraph to paragraph. In one especially irritating scene he even threw in a hint of first-person for a paragraph or so. Maybe if I'd kept reading I would have found a scene or two in second-person, just for good measure. The switching of narrative voices was confusing and frustrating.Perhaps the author saw his story as being so epic and/or complex that a third-person omniscient narrator was called for throughout. I certainly understand the advantages of an omniscient narrator that can relate some scenes from one character's point of view and others from a second character's point of view, and so on. But that theory doesn't fit The Name of the Wind. With most of the book, indeed the real meat of the story, being written in the first-person, the third-person sections are a minority and seem almost incidental, merely setting the stage and creating some dynamic/juxtaposition. And the theory doesn't explain why some scenes are told from the points of view of everyone present (a voice that strikes me as pompous and unreal) while other scenes are described objectively, from nobody's point of view. Still other scenes alternate points of view paragraph by paragraph, or even sentence by sentence, and at a couple of points I wasn't entirely sure who's thoughts I was reading. Such constant switching without an obvious purpose or pattern made the omniscient narrator (if that's what was intended) seem unreliable.Now on to the bulk of the book: Kvothe's first-person account of his life story. Kvothe's account actually read much smoother than the third-person interludes. Without the worry of mixing up his voices, the author did a much better job on the first-person narrative. Indeed, Kvothe's story incorporates some fair (not horrible, not great) drama, suspense, and sentiment. Portions are even quite quotable. The Author was thoughtful and observant in his telling of Kvothe's story, relating events and thoughts with which I could identify and pointing out a few things I wouldn’t have thought of. Unfortunately, for the reasons set forth below, those good qualities were not sufficient to demand my continued attention.Many passages in Kvothe's story felt lazy, unnecessary, unintended, or unoriginal. A few things were just plain weird. For example:--> Kvothe asks his father a question and the father makes a big deal about wanting to answer with a poem, but after five lines he forgets the rest. Setting aside that the five remembered lines were some shitty poetry, why is the rest forgotten? If the poem was important, then the author should have taken the time (or sought the help) to craft something decent for the father to recite. If the poem was not important, why have the father recite a poem at all? A pointless poem only serves to clutter the prose. --> As a boy Kvothe watched his parents make out so he could learn kissing technique. That's weird.--> Speaking of Kvothe watching his parents, he has some sort of Oedipal affection for his mother. It shows in a few places but never more so than when he describes his mother as ""slender, fresh, and bright, pale and smooth-skinned in the firelight."" I have trouble reconciling the Oedipus Complex with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Unless I just misunderstand one or the other?2ND FOOTNOTEWhat I find especially interesting is my suspicion that the author was not consciously creating the Oedipal attraction. Similarly I suspect the author was not consciously creating the romantic connection between Kvothe and Bast. Maybe if I'd finished the book I would have found out that Kvothe was a gay man who masturbated to the memory of his mother. But I doubt it.END 2ND FOOTNOTE--> Kvothe declares that he will ""sum up"" a certain magical principle and begins with his ""first"" point. He then expounds upon that first point, but never reaches a second point, nor a third or fourth. The explanation merely peters out.--> Kvothe's father sets up a dichotomy between poetry and music that I don't believe exists. (I admit that's only a disagreement rather than a problem with the writing.)--> In several places there was a lack of creativity with turn of phrase. One passage uses the phrase ""there are times"" too many times.--> The author uses the definite article in a number of places were the indefinite article would have been more appropriate. In the passage I marked as an example, Kvothe talks about going ""deeper into the city"" without any prior mention of having entered any city, much less being on the verge of going deeper into it.--> In another place, a beautiful metaphor was ruined when the author spelled out his meaning explicitly. Some metaphors are more powerful if left implied, resting behind the words for the observant reader to find on his own. In this instance, it went from beautiful metaphor to so-so analogy.I also have a much more fundamental, underlying problem with the entire storyline. That is the quality of Kvothe as a character. He's portrayed as a superhuman hero with a towering intellect and dazzling physical prowess. Kvothe can do nothing wrong; no puzzle is too difficult and no problem too big to handle. He can thrive under any circumstance and no lady can resist his advances (neither can beautiful goat-men, for that matter). He wins over the most cynical skeptics and his knowledge of the arts and sciences is without equal. Kvothe advises kings and kills demons. He can even run a clean and comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Kvothe, himself, is his own story's deus ex machina. And that, to me, it is the ultimate expression of unimaginative writing. Supposedly Mr. Rothfuss wrote The Name of the Wind over the course of a decade or more. You'd think, with all that time to contemplate and mull over his book, he could come up with something more interesting than (ironically) ""The Most Interesting Man in the World.""","I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoAs an avid adult fantasy reader, out of all the books that I’ve been recommended, The Name of the Wind has always been recommended to me the most. Google, Goodreads, book reviewing sites, 9gag, even some people who don't read a lot of fantasy books, they have all praised the series highly and now that I’ve read it, it’s in my opinion that the fame is totally well deserved; there’s no doubt that this is truly a fantastic high fantasy book.In terms of plot overview, the book is simplistic enough. Kvothe Kingkiller, Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, the man of many names tells the story of his life to the Chronicler, who will write Kvothe’s entire chronicle starting from his childhood up to his present life as an innkeeper in Waystone Inn. Kvothe will tell the entire chronicle of his life within three days and The Name of the Wind encompassed Day One of his storytelling. That’s it, that’s really the basic premise of the story; you can even call this novel a high fantasy memoir if you want.

Picture: Tarbean by Dan dos SantosIf you haven’t read this book yet, you’re probably wondering why this book became one of the most highly acclaimed fantasy books of our time. Honestly, I have to agree that it’s seriously one of the best out there; it’s simply amazing and there are a lot of factors in the book that worked so well harmoniously towards producing that result. However, there’s one single element in the book that excels above all the others.Is it the characters?Could be, The Name of the Wind is thoroughly a character-driven book and if the characters weren’t well-written the book would pretty much be screwed. The whole book is told solely from Kvothe’s perspective; it’s written in third person POV for the present timeframe, shifting to first-person POV during the flashback sequences which means you’ll be seeing the first person POV more often than the other. Trust me, they are extremely well-written. Kvothe is a memorable character and his narrative is wonderfully compelling to read. The Name of the Wind is his coming of age tale, covering his life from the time he was eight years old up to his fifteenth year.

“When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.”

We will read about Kvothe’s struggle during this period of time and how his life was an ever-changing cycle fortune and disaster. Plus, the addition of empathizing side characters such as Bast, Simmone, Elodin, and Auri made the book even more intriguing. However, I have to say no, it's not the incredibly well-written characters that dazzled the most to me.Is it the world-building?Well, it’s true that the world-building of Temerant is tremendous and intricately crafted. The currency, mythology, legends, songs, and a unique magic system called Sympathy felt so real and believable to me; they enhanced the immersive and vivid nature of the narrative. And yet, no, it’s not the world-building.What is it then, the action?No, don’t come into this book expecting a lot of battle or war scenes because you’ll most likely be disappointed. The narration is extremely engaging and also intense in some places, but there are—approximately—only twenty pages of battle scenes in total. The Name of the Wind will not pull you into the usual grand tale of 'Good vs Evil' where the main story revolves around the protagonists’ struggle against the villains to save the world. So no, it’s not the action.It's music: the part that captivated me more than anything else in the book was its depiction of music.

“Music is a proud, temperamental mistress. Give her the time and attention she deserves, and she is yours. Slight her and there will come a day when you call and she will not answer. So I began sleeping less to give her the time she needed.”

There’s a huge emphasis on music right from the beginning of the story all the way to the end. No matter what the genre we read, we are all obsessed with music. Music is vastly integral to the overall quality of the book; it’s insane how beautifully written the depiction of music and sounds are. I could see the way the fingers and strings dance to form the music; I could hear the audience in the tavern cheering when Kvothe played the lute vigorously; I could hear the silence of the crowd when Kvothe stopped playing and most of all, I could feel the emotions oozing out of the audience through the music, music that was created specifically through words and letters. One of my favorite scenes in The Name of the Wind is when ""The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard,"" a legendary tragic ballad composed by the most famous Edema Ruh, was performed. It’s so masterfully written and right now, in my head, I have my own perception of how this song should sound; I can’t wait to see how that perception compares to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s rendition of this song in the upcoming TV series adaptation of this novel.Picture: Playing For His Pipes by Dan dos SantosIt’s a tricky business to find the right formula to unify all these magnificent elements in a book, especially with music being one of them. But Rothfuss managed to do it.How did he achieve the superb balance for all those factors?Superlative prose. Seriously, I can’t stress this highly enough, Rothfuss’s writing style is unquestionably phenomenal; there’s a glimpse of grace in almost every word you’ll read in the book. Without Rothfuss’s prose, The Name of the Wind would probably receive a 2 or 3 stars rating at most from me. Patrick Rothfuss is a master craftsman with words and his prose deserves only the highest of praise from me. There is a myriad of quotable (or should I say Kvothable) statements and phrases throughout the story that made me feel like writing them all down in my notebook, and yes I did.

“Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts.” 

It’s meticulous, brilliantly unputdownable, elegant, lyrical, and poetic. It’s evident how the fourteen years of revision and editing brought fruition to this absolutely marvelous result.By the end of this book, I realized The Name of the Wind has immersed me in an intricate role-play situation. Through reading this book, I became more than myself. I am not just the reader who read a masterpiece called The Name of the Wind, I am not the Chronicler who wrote Kvothe’s journey, and I am not Kvothe’s loyal apprentice. I am the one they call Reshi, Bloodless, Six-String, and I am the “I” in the chronicle. My name is Kvothe, you may have heard of me. Now, I encourage you to read my story.Picture: The Name of the Wind by Marc SimonettiYou can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions","This is why I love fantasy so much. After a recent string of okay fantasy novels, a couple of good ones but nothing to get really excited about, I've rediscovered my passion thanks to this book. I'm so impressed, and so in love, I can't begin to describe it. But I can try to give you a feel for the book, if I can figure out where to start and how to do justice to this masterpiece.Kvothe (pronounced like ""Quothe"") is a world-renowned figure of mystery with a disreputable reputation - a hero or a demon depending on which stories you hear. The real man has hidden himself away at an inn in the middle of nowhere with his apprentice Bast - we know not why - and it's not until the Chronicler discovers him there that he shows any interest in reliving his past life. Insisting that his story will take three days to tell, and that the famous chronicler must write it down exactly as he tells it, he begins to share his story: a child genius growing up with his parents' troupe, performing plays and tricks across the land while being taught ""sympathy"" (magic), history, chemistry etc. by a tinker, Abenthy, who had been to the University; to ending up homeless and penniless on the streets of Treban, a big port city. It's not until he's fifteen that he makes it to the University, and is accepted, though he's three years younger than is usual. Abenthy has taught him well, and combined with his impressive memory, natural talent, quick intelligence and training, he moves quickly up the ranks of the university.There are many adventures and mishaps along the way, and while some plotlines come to a tidy end at the close of this novel, over-arching plotlines and themes have been given a solid foundation to continue on into the next books. It took a surprisingly long time for me to realise the connection between the number of days he will take to tell his story, and that this is ""Day One"" in the trilogy - it's told over the course of the first day. The only thing is, he's young yet (Chronicler judges him to be about 25, though at times he looks infintely older), and there are things happening in ""real time"" that intrude upon the story, that will need to be resolved I think - so while I have every confidence Rothfuss has excellent control over his creation, I would love more than three books :)I can't think of the last time I was this impressed by any story, let alone a fantasy novel. I won't compare it to bloody George R.R. Martin like everyone else is doing because I don't see that they have anything in common, really - one is a work of pure genius and the other is utter crap. Comparing them only heightens my dislike of A Game of Thrones. In truth, it's simply a marketing strategy to compare new books to ones that are already really popular, in order to draw in a well-established audience. This is an epic fantasy - epic in scope - but it's also a bildungsroman, a story of a person's life, a life journey (including the quiet moments), which I love. The character development is ludicrously good. The world-building is solid, believable and original - there're enough new elements to keep your interest, but not so many that you get confused and overwhelmed: a perfect balance. The design of ""sympathy"" is original and unique, and makes so much sense that I'm half-surprised it doesn't really work. It's complicated enough to not be trite, but one basic premise is the connection between things, the sympathy they have with each other - if you broke a branch in two, the two halves would still have a connection, like sharing the exact same DNA, and so if you control one half you affect the other half. Same with two pennies of the same metal, so that, if you were holding one and someone holding the other and they worked a ""binding"" on their half, and, say, lifted it in the air, then your penny would also lift. It's fabulous! It's an intellectual kind of magic, not a ""wave the wand"" type. It takes knowledge, concentration and effort, so in effect, anyone could learn.As for the characters and their growth, I am so impressed and so in love I will no doubt do a bad job of expressing it. While Kvothe's story is told in his voice, first person, the present day interludes are told in third person omniscient, but usually from certain characters' points of view. You get a mix of other people's impressions of characters, and a gentle showing that tells us even more. The genius is in how Kvothe is portrayed: while telling the story, himself as a young boy, already having experienced tragedy and sorrow and despair, and already feeling the weight of worldly concerns, but still with a lot to learn, comes across strongly. This is counter-balanced with Kvothe as a man, having been through all that and more and had it shape him into something subtly different, yet still very much the same person. If it had been written poorly, there would have been discord between the two Kvothes, but there isn't. He has so much charisma, and is such a complex sort, that I really felt for him. I may even have a bit of crush, actually. He's not good or evil, but he's suffering from a conscience: he's very human, and lonely, despite the friendship of Bast. At the same time, he's a god-like figure, an amazing musician, a skilled fighter, and a powerful magician. One moment he's commanding and chillingly masterful, the next he's doing Bast's bidding and fetching food and cutting wood for others. I expect it's his contradictions and complexities that draw me to him.The writing style is smooth, the pacing just right (though the first few chapters take a while to get you into the story, you still need to read them closely because there're a lot of details in them), and the prose isn't cluttered with boring, irrelevant descriptions or pointless details. It's a fat book and a long story, but it flies by. While it needed better proofreading - there were a lot of problems with dialogue punctuation; there were a few lazy typos; he never once used a semicolon when he should have; and he always used ""lay"" instead of ""laid"" (but hey, at least he was consistent) - the prose itself is engaging, often humorous, detailed but not overly so, and never boring. I also loved the little songs and ditties that are included, and the stories within Kvothe's story.Likewise, the way he doles out the various plots, revealing and hinting at the right moments, building up tension and anticipation, giving clues that start to coalesce into a stunning picture, is, frankly, impressive. The supporting cast, while not as fully explored as Kvothe (it is his story, after all), are in their own ways vividly portrayed and gradually explored. There's no chunky exposition or a description of a character shoved at you all at once. It's more a show-not-tell kind of book, appreciating the intellect of its audience and our ability to figure things out for ourselves. Nicely done. There was a while there, when I was reading, that the prose gave me the same kind of thrill as reading a sex scene in a romance novel might - but it could have just been the excitment of the story.One last thing (though I could go on forever): I loved what he did with dragons. I won't spoil it by saying more, just that it's original and delightful - this coming from someone who's been known to get a mite bored by dragons in fantasy.I would easily recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy, but also to people who enjoy great stories told wonderfully well. As many non-fantasy readers loved Harry Potter, they would also love this book."
A Clash of Kings,George R.R. Martin,4.42,"Instead of writing a review, I'm just going to post a list of the facial expressions I made while reading this book:



































However... I feel this one most accurately sums up A Clash of Kings:","This isn’t going to be a cutesy review. I am well into the third book. I fear that if I don’t blurt out my thoughts about this one soon, then all the books in the series are going to meld together in my memory. Here are my three main impressions:1. Bleak, dreary, and dismalDon’t expect any happiness in this book. Martin is merciless with his characters. And if you do see a bright light, don’t trust it. One character learned she won’t have to marry an abusive, horrible guy. She and I were elated. Then someone pointed out that her ex-fiancé could still abuse her as he desires, and few would be able to stop him.2. Eeny, meeny, miny, moeIt occurred to me halfway through a big battle that I didn’t know who I was rooting for. The defender is a cruel king and has a tenuous claim to the throne, but I like a few of the characters in his castle and feared what would happen to them if they lose. The attacker would probably be a fair king, yet he is cold and distant. He has a better claim than most to the throne. However I doubt he could hold it for long. Precisely who did I want to win? It was not a problem of apathy. Martin drew the characters and politics so craftily that I just could not decide. Honestly, instead of picking, I sat back and enjoyed the twists and turns.3. Better keep up!The scope of the plot is ever-expanding. I give Martin kudos for having such a grand vision and keeping it all straight. I don't feel that any of the storylines are unnecessary (except, I hate to say it, maybe Arya’s). And I have complete faith that they will culminate in the most amazing way by the end of series. Yet it is inevitable that you will prefer some perspectives over others. I counted the pages in between Daenerys’ chapters – an average of 130 pages! And this is a middle book. There are no cliffhangers, but very little is resolved. If it is resolved, that means someone died. Unless they are only pretending to be dead, of course.I lied. One more point.4. Awesomeness","(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: So much tension builds from uncertainty. Nearly everyone is helpless, and so the resolution is always unpredictable."
The Return of the King,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.58,"♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥a rousing climax to the most ravishing love story of the modern age. tempestuous, tormented Frodo at long last learns to accept the love of his lifemate - the loyal and submissive Samwise Gamgee, bottom-extraordinaire. this is truly a tale of love's labour hard-won, and at such a cost! but love conquers all in the end, and even bitter, militantly hetero villain Sauron cannot stand in the heart's path for too long. in this third book of the torrid trilogy, Frodo's love-hate relationship with the concept of commitment - deftly symbolized by a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind, designer ring - reaches a dramatic fever pitch, as he wrestles with his awkward feelings about monogamy & gay marriage in the boiling, repressive deserts of ""Mordor"" (clearly a stand-in for maverick Texazona). fortunately, the maternal Sam is constantly by his side to offer succor - forever the wind beneath Frodo's wings.♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥the incredibly racy & erotic atmosphere is filled with a circuit party's worth of soldier types, as well as many classic queer icons: butch trade turned romantic male-model Aragorn; saucy friends-with-benefits Merry & Pippin; the tough & dour yet loveable uber-dyke Arwen; little bear-daddy Gimli; cringing closet-case Oh My Precious; fey pretty-boy Legolas; the exquisite drag queen enchantress Galadriel; and of course, presiding over them all, flouncing from scene to scene, battling his nasty sourpuss of an ex-boyfriend Saruman, and just chewing up the scenery like no one else...the fabulous and effervescent Gandalf the Gay. you go, girlfriend! ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥despite the couple dozen unnecessary scenes of Sam staring dreamily into Frodo's sad sad eyes, this is truly a flawless and timeless gay classic, one that boldly states Love Is a Glorious Burden That We Must Ever Shoulder. love knows no boundaries. and even the smallest of men can have the biggest....""heart"", i suppose. queer fave Enya even contributes to the soundtrack. Return of the King is a luscious, deliriously homoerotic fantasia.♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥oops, forgot i wasn't reviewing the thrillingly fagtastic film version. well, as far as the novel goes, it is perfect. i wouldn't change a word. even the poetry is awesome.",bawling my eyes out; for not all tears are an evil,"""The review was only a small and passing thing: there were likes and comments forever beyond its reach.”  With Isengard defeated, Middle Earth bought a brief respite; but the war is hardly over, as the endless hordes of the dark lord Sauron encircles Minas Tirith, last bastion of hope of the Realm of Men. The broken remains of the Fellowship trying to reach it, before it’s reduced to rubble; and at the helm, Aragorn, last descendant of a lineage of kings long forgotten, and massively outnumbered. In faraway lands, the defenseless Frodo and Sam still trying to reach Mount Doom, and just one wrong step away of getting caught, and everything lost. This is it, the end of the line. Tolkien saving the best for last, ending the deed with an other-worldly conclusion for the trilogy that forever changed fantasy history. Utterly captivating from start to finish, fairly fast paced, overwhelmingly action packed, unputdownable (except for the descriptions, songs and poems -ehem-), and enormously emotional. But overall, 1000% EPIC. In this final installment we get to visit some jaw dropping locations like Minas Tirith, the White Mountains, Cirith Ungol, Mordor, and Mount Doom. –uh oh scary! Not a lot of new characters stepping in this time, but plenty stepping out. A load of moments to remember by.  The Lightning of the Beacons, the Path of the Dead, the Siege of Gondor, the Cave of Ungoliant, and the oopsie at Mount Doom.  All questions answered, everything revealed, every single character storyline closed, and nothing left out to chance, or at least, nothing that I can recall. A marvelous conclusion, and a series I’ll never forget; and neither will you, when you give it a chance.*** LOTR: The Return of the King (2003) is yet another superb adaptation, highly acclaimed, Oscar galore, my favorite of them all. 1000% EPIC, and maybe I’m selling it short. As always, extremely faithful to the book, although I never fail to remember that the Saruman and Grima ending at Hobbiton was *slightly* altered. And hats down to mighty Eowyn, who took down two oliphants, one nazgul, and nothing less than one immortal Witch King on top of all things, not to mention god knows how many orcs. Did I say it’s Highly Recommendable? Probably not. (10/10) (EXTENDED edition)Goodbye my mangled Fellowship! Will miss you!-----------------------------------------------

The Lord of the Rings  ----------------------------------------------- ""La reseña era sólo una cosa pequeña y pasajera: había likes y comentarios para siempre fuera de su alcance.”  Con Isengard derrotada, la Tierra Media logró un breve respiro; pero la guerra está lejos de terminar, mientras las innumerables hordas del señor oscuro Sauron se ciernen sobre Minas Tirith, último bastión de esperanza del Reino de los Hombres. Los quebrados restos de la Comunidad tratando de alcanzarla, antes de que sea reducida a escombros; y a la cabeza, Aragorn, último descendiente de una línea de reyes largamente olvidada, y masivamente superado en número. En tierras lejanas, los indefensos Frodo y Sam todavía intentando alcanzar el Monte del Destino, y a sólo un mal paso de ser capturados, y todo perdido.Esto es, el final de la línea. Tolkien guardando lo mejor para el final, terminando su obra con una conclusión de otro mundo para la trilogía que por siempre cambió la historia de la fantasía. Completamente cautivadora desde el principio hasta el final, de ritmo rápido, sobreabundantemente cargada de acción, imposible dejar de leer (excepto por las descripcione, canciones y poemas -ejem-), y enormemente emocional. Pero por sobre todo, 1000% EPICO. En esta entrega final conocemos extraordinarios lugares como Minas Tirith, las Montañas Blancas, Cirith Ungol, Mordor, y el Monte del Destino. –uy qué miedo! No muchos personajes nuevos entrando esta vez, pero sí muchos saliendo. Una multitud de momentos para el recuerdo.  La Iluminación de las Balizas, el Paso de los Muertos, el Asedio de Gondor, la Cueva de Ungoliant, y el pequeño traspié en el Monte del Destino.  Todas las preguntas respondidas, todo revelado, cada trama de personaje cerrada, y nada dejado al azar, o al menos, nada que pueda recordar. Una maravillosa conclusión, y una serie que nunca voy a olvidar; y tampoco tú, cuando le des una oportunidad.*** LOTR: El Retorno del Rey (2003) es otra sobresaliente adaptación, altamente galardonada, orgía de Oscars, mi favorita de todas. 1000% EPICA, y tal vez la estoy vendiendo corta. Como siempre, extremadamente fiel al libro, aunque nunca puedo dejar de olvidar que el final de Saruman y Grima en Hobbiton fue *levemente* alterado. Y todos los honores para la gran Eowyn, que acabó con dos olifantes, un nazgul, y nada menos que un inmortal Dios Brujo como si fuera poco, sin mencionar quien sabe cuanta cantidad de orcos. ¿Ya dije que es Altamente Recomendable? Probablemente no. (10/10) (Versión EXTENDIDA)¡Adiós mi aporreada Comunidad! ¡Los voy a extrañar!-----------------------------------------------

My Documents,Kevin  Nguyen,4.00,"a dystopian that feels too real... when a dystopian stops feeling shocking and just has you nodding your head, does that mean we're too far gone?","ANHPI Heritage Month 2025 #11✨ LA Times Festival of Books 2025 ✨/ The F Words: Family, Fame, and [Mis] Fortune in Contemporary Fiction/ Saturday, April 26, 2025/ 2:00 PM/ The Ray Stark Family TheatreMeredith Maran was one of the worst moderators I've ever had to listen to. The authors handled her beautifully. I wouldn't have. 0/10II don’t know what took me so long to pick this up. I’m really enjoying this.Families are messy. I don’t know if Vietnamese families are messier than most, or if it’s just my extended family that’s extremely messy, but either way, I get it.We get introduced to a few members of this family saga. I don’t quite know if I love Ursula or hate her, but as the daughter of a Vietnamese man and white woman, with one brother and two half siblings they call cousins (it’s more palatable/polite) trying to work in journalism (a very much not Asian approved field: it’s doctor, lawyer, engineer, or accountant, in that order), her story speaks to me. It’s captivating me more than the others. I find Jen juvenile and annoying. I forgot the boys’ names. This section ends with a terrorist attack. We have been shown the Japanese Internment, and how most of us don't learn about this in American History. Shameful. And in this day and age, unfortunately still so relevant. No one is safe. They’ll come for you next. IIThis section went quickly. I enjoyed the first section just a tad more. Obviously, this is where shit starts to go down.Even though it's the Vietnamese that launched a terrorist attack, it's Vietnamese Americans that are rounded up and tossed into concentration camps. (Why must we be hyphenated? Why are Asian Americans combined like this? No one calls white people European Americans, but I may start.)Kevin wrote this pre Trump part two, but it's oddly reminiscent of current happenings. I don't say this in a good way.Ursula and her brother, whose name I cannot remember, get exemptions. If you remember, they have one white parent and are white passing. Their half siblings, called cousins for whatever palatable reason, are detained. Ursula finally deigns to reply to Jen's texts. It's too little too late.IIIThings are picking up. Or growing more horrifying. Your choice. As the Vietnamese Americans are firmly ensconced in the camps, some settle into captivity. Some don't. Jen joins a group a resistance. It's always the young.I remember Jen's brother's name now. It's Duncan. I can't really tell you anything about him, because I find him boring.Jen leaks information to Ursula, who finally deigns to respond. With this news, Ursula can finally become a serious reporter. She is told to stop using her mother's white last name, and that her father's Vietnamese surname lends more credence to her stories. Some authors do this. I am guilty of second guessing a book if the author's name looks too western.IVI know the other brother's name now. It's Alvin. Do you hate these play-by-play reviews? At least one of you all loves them. Not that I care.Alvin works at Google, the only reason he is exempt from the camps. Also, he passes. But Ursula was exempt all along. Anyway, he leaks documents (decks, not slideshows - get with it, non-techies) to his sister to publish and acts brand new when Google catches him. He is fired. He is a little shocked. No one else is.So obviously, Alvin can no longer afford to live in the Bay Area. He gallivants across the US to stay with Ursula in New York, doing little chores for her in order to earn his keep.The other siblings are finally interesting to me, as we near the end. Ursula meets up with El Paquete, the go between for Jen to get messages to her. Also the supplier of the camps. At first, we’re enamored with the face behind the help. Then we realize he’s just like every other man, taking advantage where he shouldn’t. Is it so hard to be decent?Shit goes down at Jen’s camp. I want to kill Dennis, who I can picture as a 5’5” rat whose Hinge profile contains all selfies and lists his height as 5’8”. Did I date this man? Actually, no. I was going to say my taste in Vietnamese men isn’t this bad, but that’s a lie. IYKYKVNot that things weren't already sad, but they get sadder. This loss, which I won't mention, feels pervasive. As loss often does, it binds people together. Why does it take something sad to bring people together? Why can't it be something happy? My extended family, in particular, are guilty of this. Have we done anything to change our behavior? No.I was going to say Ursula isn't really a palatable character, but truly, none of these people are. No one anywhere is. We contain multitudes, and that's what makes us people.I was also going to say I don't know what took so long for the rest of the American people (because Vietnamese Americans, and everyone else you try to hyphenate are American) to realize that the camps were horrifying and unconstitutional, but I do.All in all, an amazing read, and one pushed forward for this heritage month I have certain feelings about, and listening to Kevin speak at LATFOB. All of the authors on the panel were fantastic. I have TEHRANGELES. I put the others on hold. Once again, the moderator was horrible. She ignored and asked questions only a white woman would. I'll leave it at that.📖 Thank you to One World📱 Thank you to NetGalley and One World","When dystopian books stop feeling quite so dystopian... yikes. To be fair, this book isn't dystopian as it is inspired by the very real Japanese incarceration in America, as well as modern-day immigrant detention. The idea that an entire group of people could be detained and imprisoned because of their race SHOULD be dystopian. Unfortunately, Nguyen's novel doesn't seem so far-fetched in the current state of politics. This book hit all the notes for me and will be one of my top recommendations for some time.**I received this advance copy free from One World via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.**"
Where the Axe Is Buried,Ray Nayler,3.95,"this book has left me reeling. in a good way. the chapters are told from the perspectives of our main characters, which sometimes cross each other. there’s two elements that i found the most interesting. disclaimer - i am not knowledgeable about all topics and geopolitical aspects that have served as inspiration for this novel, so i will speak of what i know. as a person with russian heritage and family that lives there in near poverty but still blindly and actively supports the regime, or shrugs in apathy, the tale of zoya hit close to home. as someone who has not seen that part of the family in years, lilia was relatable to me. nayler also touched upon the topic of refugees and their worth, depending on their home country. does a refugee from an agressor state deserve pity? in general, i felt like „where the axe is buried“ presented a pretty accurate account of the way russia has been functioning.„In the years that followed, Zoya and her allies would come to understand that they would never win. Their resistance to power was purely symbolic.“ „And when the West makes their accusations,“ Krotov said, „we accuse them of lying. And we repeat our own lie to them again. Forever.“ these parts of the book reflected the feeling of helplessness that i see in russian speaking anti-authoritarian communities. what can be done against such a system? in „where the axe is buried“, the author describes an ending so not in tune with the bleak starting situation, it gave me whiplash. for that, i am deducting one star. the second aspect i found interesting was the setup and fall of the PMs. „We mystified the public with the idea that the machines were intelligent, maybe even conscious, when they really were nothing more than incredibly advanced statistical calculators, designed to give us the kinds of solutions we needed them to give.“ the next person that says „oh let me just ask chatgpt“ to my face will get slapped with this book. the gen ai craze is costing me my last nerve. that is all i will be saying on this matter thank you :) one last thing - the book was well written, i really enjoyed naylers style. however, my knowledge of the russian language and folklore did help me out at multiple points. if this book is meant for people unfamiliar with russian, perhaps it would be smart to include a glossary. i feel like some small but interesting aspects of the story would be lost otherwise.thank you to netgalley and farrar, straus and giroux for the arc provided in exchange for an honest review.","[NetGalley Read #19]4.5 ⭐""Any way you looked at it, a human being was doing the killing. The machine was nothing but a tool.""Excellent.Great story. Good characters.An acute examination of evil, power, resistance, our overdependence on technology and its pitfalls, and what it means to be human in a world gone mad.- Observation Shadow (Book 1: Chapters 1–12)A solid setup. The narrative establishes relationships between characters from different places/countries, builds their motivations, reveals their backgrounds, and creates a dystopian world that is barbaric, cruel, and unforgiving. Despite all this, there remains a glimmer of hope and resistance.- The Children of Sarez (Book 2: Chapters 13–24)Secrets are revealed. Governments fall. The world descends into chaos. The plot thickens.- What the Wasps Know (Book 3: Chapters 25–36)Heavily focused on The Federation (which makes sense). Great payoffs.All in all, a great book. Not overly long and definitely worth the time.Recommended. 👍- Plot: In the authoritarian Federation, there is a plot to assassinate and replace the President, a man who has downloaded his mind to a succession of new bodies to maintain his grip on power. Meanwhile, on the fringes of a Western Europe that has renounced human governance in favor of ostensibly more efficient, objective, and peaceful AI Prime Ministers, an experimental artificial mind is malfunctioning, threatening to set off a chain of events that may spell the end of the Western world.As the Federation and the West both start to crumble, Lilia, the brilliant scientist whose invention may be central to bringing down the seemingly immortal President, goes on the run, trying to break out from a near-impenetrable web of Federation surveillance. Her fate is bound up with a worldwide group of others fighting against the global status quo: Palmer, the man Lilia left behind in London, desperate to solve the mystery of her disappearance; Zoya, a veteran activist imprisoned in the taiga, whose book has inspired a revolutionary movement; Nikolai, the President’s personal physician, who has been forced into more and more harrowing decisions as he navigates the Federation’s palace politics; and Nurlan, the hapless parliamentary staffer whose attempt to save his Republic goes terribly awry. And then there is Krotov, head of the Federation’s security services, whose plots, agents, and assassins are everywhere.",Not since Cloud Atlas has multi-person perspective been as exciting. The manner in which Ray does scene shift and zooming is nothing short of genius.
Meet Me at Blue Hour,Sarah Suk,4.01,"Sarah Suk just comes up with the most genius and creative books ever. LIKE BEING ABLE TO ERASE MEMORIES USING SOUNDS?! LIKE HELLO!? THATS SO COOL.I really really wanted to give this five stars just because of how much I adore The Space Between Here and Now but alas.So to say the concept of this book is great would be an understatement. But that was far from the only great thing. The writing? beautiful. The characters? Flawless. The descriptions about food? I was salivating throughout the entire novel. The romance was pretty cute, I love a good childhood friends to lovers and their little adventures were oh so fun to read about.My only big complaint is that this book was missing its substance, I don’t know how to explain it but the The Space Between Here and Now was so emotional and impactful whereas this one after I finished it I could easily move on from my life.","the teenage loneliness, despair, and angst are strong in this one. very justified. also, the concept of erasing memories is perfect for scifi and horror because the world is insane and people can be the worst. see: criminal mindsbut given the chance, i would love to erase the embarrassing memories of teenage me that attack me in the middle of the night.","""People who don’t care about you anymore shouldn’t still get to hold on to pieces of you.""
Would you erase your most traumatic memory for even a moment of peace?The whole time I read this book my face alternated between these two: 🤠🥲Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets Past Lives in a dual-POV YA contemporary about two friends who grew apart with the aid (or hindrance?) of memory tampering, set in South Korea. This is an excellent choice for a book club!TW: Side character with Alzheimer's; Near-death experience (drowning); PTSD and nightmares; Grief; Chronic migraines; Panic attack (on-page)CW: Divorced parents; Friendship breakup; Mentions of abusive relationships & death of a parentPossibly a 4.5? I keep going back and forth. I didn't cry so I'm leaning toward the 4 for Goodreads purposes. A good cry changes everything, as you know!!MEET ME AT BLUE HOUR is kind of about two different main themes that intersect: a friendship breakup and the significance of memory, specifically the sanctity of memory and how it shapes both us as a people and the people in our lives. We follow both leads, Yena and Lucas, in first person POV, along with snippets from the influential sounds from their past. You'll get it when you read it, I promise.I don't want to say much about the plot because it's more emotional and impactful with this particular story, but it's definitely worth a read and then a really good long shower afterwards so you can stare at the wall and contemplate your entire existence!!My friend AK wrote an eloquent review that is far superior to this one, so go read it here.Rep: Korean-Canadian main character; Korean-Canadian main character with chronic migraines, PTSD, and anxietyThank you to Epic Reads for the copy in exchange for an honest review.

Terrestrial History,Joe Mungo Reed,4.03,"[4.75+]Joe Mungo Reed, where have your books been in my life? This is my first. Just as I need it, when I have loved ones on the verge of no-man’s land, you come out with a bombshell literary sci-fi dystopian novel that puts so many others like this to shame. Terrestrial History probes Time and space during the transitions that mark planetary destruction and exploration—specifically to Mars. It’s not what you think. It’s more than you know.Pay attention, because this is no Star Trek, this is not network TV in a book. A family of four Scottish generations are either trying to escape Earth or save it. Hannah, a scientist (from our future, but most of the book’s past) is visited by a man from space, urging and helping her to progress in her research in order to essentially save human life. Her diligence also sparks conflict with her son, Andrew, who she semi-neglected while he was growing up in order to do her work. The planet is being destroyed by climactic crises, it's comparable to bliblical storms and weather. Andrew wants to save the world, not run away to Mars and leave the Earth’s collapse.Andrew’s daughter, Kenzie, is a tech wiz working on a reactor that is necessary for colonizing Mars. Andrew is running for First Minister, and a popular one who can win the election if he cuts his daughter from his life. She stands for everything he rejects. How far will he go to secure his election? How far will Kenzie go to flee the planet?Roban, from the next century, is an astronaut (of sorts) and a First Gen living on Mars. He goes on mysterious missions in space, including to Hannah’s cottage in the past, to her home by the Scottish sea.About 95% of the book is near future or even further future, and it doesn’t all come together neatly while you are reading; it assembles and connects gradually. I admit to many unknowns and a cryptic quality regarding some of the characters and events. The narrative is just outstanding. Reed’s method of telling a story and powers of description are exceptional, rare. There’s also an affecting allegory to Plato’s Cave.Yes, it is dense at times, and there are places where he gets a bit dilatory due to the way he carries out scenes and events, but it’s excusable. The author bridges philosophy, science, and a dramatic family story in page after page of a winning narrative. It’s not flawless, but the way he merges the cerebral, scientific, psychological and emotional facets of story is arresting. The novel is also filled with vivid and robust prose. There’s an interior moment where Hannah says that she sometimes thinks of herself as a sports star famous for one great move long ago, or a singer who recorded one good song. My whole life, it sometimes seems, happened in less than three days. What had occurred before that was buildup, and what came after, consequence.”Not to be missed, imho. Thank you so much to Norton publishers for sending me a copy for review.","I would like to thank W.W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for the chance to review an advanced copy of this remarkable book.In what felt like one of those moments where the universe likes to laugh and show you that it’s paying attention, I started reading Joe Mungo Reed’s Terrestrial History on the same day that a friend of mine sent me a video showing that the current administration in the United States was going to be implementing an executive order that would promote the usage of plastic straws. No matter where you fall on whatever limp debate exists about plastic straw usage and their overall impact on the environment, it has been impossible to ignore the effect that humanity and industry have had on our planet as we’ve all experienced a seismic shift in how the place that we call home is reacting to our ever-expanding presence.Because of this shift, a significant chunk of fiction writing has emerged that imagines possible futures, possible solutions and, of course, possible endings to our current predicament. Lydia Millet released A Children’s Bible in 2020 right at the cusp of a worldwide pandemic and Joy Williams released Harrow as we moved into what we were hoping was a post-pandemic world. To me, both of these novels represent a high mark in what has often been made reference to as climate fiction or “cli-fi”. With Terrestrial History, Joe Mungo Reed has created a document that deserves to stand not just among the absolute best of this hyper-specific genre tag, but also as one of the best works of this young year.Terrestrial History follows four narrators, each from a different generation over a period of 85 years beginning in our present day of 2025. Hannah is a meticulous and unparalleled expert in the study of fusion science whose unique ideas have branded her a near-pariah among her peers. Andrew follows a strict moral code and believes in the inherent goodness of people to the point that he runs for office in an attempt to help shape and fix a world that is mired in climate panic for his daughter. Kenzie has spent her life wrestling with balancing her own ambitions and pragmatic beliefs with that of her more dreamy father and working to find a common ground that allows both of their goals to be realized without compromise. Roban is inquisitive and determined and part of the first group of children that were born on Earth’s first colony on Mars whose fascination with what those in the colony refer to as “Home” leads him to make shocking discoveries about the universe and about his family history.The story begins at a home on the edge of the coast in Scotland as Hannah glances out to the ocean and notices a strange man walking towards the beach unbothered by the tides that surround him. Hannah’s reaction to this man explaining that he has arrived here from a colony on a distant planet and from the future is to accept this reality with wonder and with open arms. From here, Terrestrial History charts a path that spans four generations and two planets, dipping in and out of disparate time periods to weave a story not just of what ultimately happened to Earth, but how the events that led to part of humanity exiting the planet was shaped by the family at the heart of the story and how it affected them. Joe Mungo Reed’s characters feel real and lived-in to a point of feeling like you have met all of them or have been aware of them at some point in your life. As you take in each chapter and each separate voice, the distinct differences in their tones and mannerisms are evident as it is always clear who is speaking to you. Through these scattered stories that jump around these eighty-five years, there is a realization that the actions of each individual generation - the little hesitations, the bold statements and actions taken, the unspoken thoughts - all have ramifications on the future…and the past. Terrestrial History both exists in a reality that feels all-too-possible and one that feels just enough outside the realm of possibility that it will make you wonder, hope and dream about what we still have left to discover about our universe and about ourselves.","Did Not Finish 40 percentPlease note that I received this book via NetGalley. This did not affect my rating or review. I tried. But with the world and my current job the way it is. I am not doing one blessed thing this year that is not bringing me joy. Heck, sometimes I can read a book that I am not exactly hate reading, but I go into a ""I am finishing this because what in the world is happening here and where is the author going?"" mode. But sometimes, like this, I hit an, ""I just don't care. I don't care about the characters, the journey, the ending. I refuse to keep reading this because it's doing my head in."" mode. I really did love the cover of this book when I saw it. I don't know with the world the way it is right now, it spoke to me. The book synopsis did too. I liked the idea of following four people in really separate timelines that end up being the key from humankind moving on from an Earth that is growing more inhabitable to a settlement on Mars.""Terrestrial History"" follows Hannah, who is working off the coast of Scotland and is a scientist working on fusion. Roban lives in the Colony (big C every time it is discussed which was jarring) where he dreams of Earth. And then you have Andrew and his daughter Kenzie who are taking up different sides about whether Earth can really come back the way it needs to for humankind to survive. Throw some time travel in (which honestly this book did not need that at all) and that's this book.I have to say this upfront. This book was pretentious as hell. I don't know. It didn't hit me the right way at all. And I got tired of honestly just wading though paragraphs upon paragraphs about ethics, morality, etc. It didn't help the story is out of order. Just to let you readers know, the book plot is not written chronologically which made it hard to follow. I had to hunt to to look for who was speaking and what year it was at all times which was jarring. For example, Hannah is in whatever year. I can't tell you. At one point it just says Hannah no year so I assume that's present day? Roban is in year 2103, Kenzie and Andrew are in year 2071.Hannah's chapters/perspectives were easier to wade into than Roban/Andrew/Kenzie. Each character perspective is told first person point of view and yet they all sound the same. And honestly that is what really did me in. I would assume these people in different points of time would ""sound different"" and they did not. At the 40 percent mark I gave up."
When We Were Real,Daryl Gregory,4.08,"I've been thinking that it was time for a Gregory when I heard about his upcoming release. He's on my shortlist of favorite authors, but the interesting thing about that is how generally reluctant I am to re-read his books. Though he is particularly good at bringing characters to life in emotional ways, they often go through a hard path to the moment of catharsis. For me his works are theoretically re-readable due to quality and complexity, but in real life, I've only re read Afterparty and We Are All Completely Fine. Thankfully, he's been a slow but steady publisher so I can enjoy his style in new stories.Gregory, you say. Who is he? Oh, you know, one of those wildly undervalued authors--at least commercially--who has had his works nominated for Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy and Shirley Jackson Awards, so clearly people in the know are paying attention. He's readable, with a tone that feels almost humorous at times, until the character has his heart wrenched out. He writes, in an interesting way, about the now, and I've come to think of him as a zeitgeist author. Not in a bad, topical surface way, with works that won't make much sense in a decade, let alone this year, but in an 'understand the moment' kind of way. He's done that again with When We Were Real. You should probably read it if you like to think about online life and what makes us human.I hesitate to say much about the story, because I think it's deliciousness is in the unfolding. Save to say that, of course, the blurb gets it partially wrong. If you know anything about The Canterbury Tales--and I didn't know much, but Wikipedia helped me along--is that it is a story of a journey, both real and philosophical, told from multiple points of view. Gregory bows to convention enough to tie them together with a head-scratching plot. But much like The Last Policeman, the story is in how the individual is choosing to cope with The Event as manifested by the plot. Oh, The Event, you say? That we're living in The Matrix. As I said, a zeitgeist author.I love the tongue-in-cheek tone, just wry enough to make me smile, and sometimes wince:About JP, one of our travelers: ""A year ago he had a bout with brain cancer, and took early retirement in the same way a boxer takes an unguarded uppercut. Out by TKO.""About the nurse on the trip: ""This one is divorced with no children, a crime punishable, evidently, with a lifetime sentence of unpaid chaperoning."" Ouch. Stop seeing me.And just to make sure the reader understands their own role: ""A person we'll call THE READER is sitting quietly, turning the pages of their book... they're here now, and happy to ignore the other passengers, as if everything they need to know is encoded in the sentences on the page.""Yep. Pretty brilliant. In my own thoughts, I think it got a little bananas at the end, and then he had the nerve to go and make me sad. Still, super-creative--particularly the North American Impossibles, the local attractions that prove the Simulation. Highly recommended, and highly re-readable. But first, I'm going to go re-read We Are All Completely Fine.Four and a half sheep, rounding up.Many thanks to Netgalley and Saga Press for the advance reader copy. All opinions my own. Quotes subject to change in final publication.","Overall, it was a smart and funny story about a group of people on a bus tour to see glitches (North America’s “Impossibles”) after it was announced that we were living in a simulation.Once I got through the first chapter—where majority of the characters were introduced all at once—it became a fun read. At times, my mind wandered due to the number of characters and storylines, which made it a bit hard to follow.","I really must stop trying to like or even grasp a book when I'm clearly not into it, just because it seems everyone else likes it and I am curious as to why. This book was everything I hate about science fiction - too complicated, too many characters, too many scenarios, etc. It's a shame, because the basis of the book was very good and current. It had great potential, but I kept losing the thread, losing interest, and losing the will to keep on going. At some point, it became a challenge to my character. So I kept at it, and I even subjected myself to it a second time to try, really, really try to understand what the big deal is. I feel utterly defeated. I surrender! I should've kept on packing instead of taking as many breaks as I did to try to stay awake (wasn't effective!) and procrastinating (too effective)."
The Edge of Yesterday,Rita Woods,3.85,This was a very interesting book and one that will definitely stick with me. I listened to the audiobook for most of it and I really liked the narrator a lot. I thought a lot of this story was well written but I did struggle with the pacing and I wanted the characters a little more developed. This is a story about time travel. Greer’s life isn’t going where she planned on it going because she has a not yet diagnosed disease that has stripped her of her life as a dancer and made things tense with her husband. When he points out that there is little tying them to New York anymore and that he wants to join his family’s business back in Detroit she returns to a hometown she didn’t plan on returning to. But she finds herself slipping from 2025 to 1925. I thought the ending was a little abrupt and again if the pacing had been different I think it could have ended better. In some ways this book would make an excellent episode of Black Mirror. Overall I did enjoy this book and it kept my attention better than most books are this year.,"Greer Coffey, principal dancer with a renowned Harlem dance company, who marries Sebastian Coffey, an architect, part of a well known firm. They are happy, till Greer develops a neurological disorder, which completely disrupts both their lives. Returning to their home town of Detroit, she begins moving aimlessly through the streets, wondering what she'll do and worried about her strained marriage and professional future.One night, she goes through a portal back to 1925 Detroit, and meets Dr. Montgomery Gray, a member of Detroit's wealthy Black community. Monty is expected to constantly strive for the betterment of race, no matter his dreams and the many other competing and difficult situations that exist in the city: struggling and poor immigrants, gang wars due to Prohibition, and the evil of the Klan. Monty is exhausted, and shocked, then amazed to meet Greer. Not only does she show him that there are remarkable technological changes in her future, but she gets a break from her life of unhappiness. Greer visits several times, finding that each time she returns home to 2025, her body feels strong and capable, but she also sees unforeseen and not always good changes to hers and her immediate circle of family and friends' lives.Both Greer and Monty become obsessed with one another, with Greer persisting in travelling to 1925 and Monty waiting eagerly to reunite with her.I was held from the story's opening to its satisfying and melancholic ending by the great writing and wonderful characters. Greer is deeply unhappy, and gobsmacked by the look of Detroit each time she travels back in time. Monty is a doctor, but would prefer to create music. Unfortunately, his family would not be happy if he indulged his desires, so he is fascinated by the future world Greer opens his mind to. The mechanism for Greer's travel is unimportant. It's more a way to think about what choices would a person make if they felt trapped by their current existence.I liked the way author Rita Woods showed us a time in Detroit's past when, despite the many challenges, the Black community of the city looked forward to the future. At the same time, Woods skilfully demonstrated how the contact between Greer and Monty affects each negatively, with each set on a course of eventual regret and a solitary life. It's a novel full of sadness, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I listened to this story, and voice actor Dara Brown uses a soothing tone in her narration, while bringing plenty of emotion to Greer's and Monty's dialogue. I could feel the frustration both had with their lives, while also experiencing the yearning each had for some other life than the one they presently had. Thank you to Netgalley and to Brilliance Publishing for this ARC in exchange for my review.","This is a time travel story. Greer, a woman in 2025 and Monty, a man in 1925 keep getting a little bit pulled into each other's time. Then Greer gets pulled more and more into 1925, but when she comes back to the present, there are changes in our world. Those changes get more and more dramatic, but she can't really stop. I'll start with the good stuff. This author has a real passion for Detroit and its history, especially in the way Black people have been messed with there. I found this part interesting. I also liked the friendship between Greer, one of the two main characters, and her best friend.But the pacing was way off and it dragged a lot in the middle. The characters weren't terribly well developed, and by the time it ended, I felt like ""Wait- that's it?"" The journey the characters make just isn't very compelling. But hey, I read the whole thing, and I quit a whole bunch of books before I started this one because current events are so upsetting."

Awakened,A.E. Osworth,3.91,"Here is another exciting sci-fi novel that explores the dangers of AI (which has already become too real.) In Awakened, Wilder wakes up in Brooklyn one morning and discovers they understand every language in the world. This leads them to a small coven of trans witches, all with their own awakened abilities. When their world comes under threat from an evil artificial intelligence, they will have to use their powers to stop it.—Liberty Hardy, 11 Awesome New SFF Books Out April 2025",coming of middle age? they're THIRTY,"This fantasy novel about a coven of trans witches fighting an evil AI is dedicated to ""everyone who feels betrayed by J.K. Rowling"". It absolutely holds its own regardless of being a response to the Harry Potter series and JK Rowling’s transphobia—but it succeeds on that level, too. Where that series is about children, this book is about adults discovering their magic. Instead of Hogwarts, the setting is New York City. And, of course, this stars trans main characters.I was immediately taken with Awakened from the writing style. Our narrator is omnipotent and has a personality, making even character descriptions a joy to read.There’s a lot to love about Awakened, but it was the achingly real characters and their interactions that got to me the most. Our narrator provides context, showing how they talk past each other in ways informed by their own trauma.I feel like I could talk about this book for ages, especially the unforgettable characters. I haven’t even mentioned how the story is structured around Tarot cards, or the scene where they cast a love spell of protection over a drag show, or Artemis’s heartbreaking romance with a drag king she’s not quite willing to let into her life, or the surreal final battle and its bittersweet conclusion. Oh, or that this has a sex scene unlike any I’ve read before: it’s a threesome, but one of the characters isn’t corporeal.This is a complete story, but I can’t help but want to return to this world. Osworth is skillful at developing characters that feel just as complicated as real people. Their little found family is so hard-earned, and I want to keep visiting it.So yes, if you feel betrayed by JK Rowling, pick up this up. But it’s so much more than that. Whenever the character cast a spell, they being with “Pay attention. Something amazing is about to happen.” And Osworth really has done something amazing with Awakened.Full review at Book Riot."
Notes from a Regicide,Isaac Fellman,3.96,"If you one-star a book before there are even arcs of it I WILL five-star it, sorry-not-sorry.","if transphobic freaks are gonna 1-star this without reading it, you'd better believe I will cancel you out","3.5 stars rounded upBeautifully written queer literary fiction with a bit of a speculative twist. Not quite what I was expecting, and not entirely my thing stylistically, but a novel I think will resonate with the right audience. Notes from a Regicide is supposed to be a memoir/biography written by a trans man a thousand years in the future about his adoptive trans parents who were revolutionaries.This is slow-paced, deeply character driven, not always linear, and ferociously queer and trans. Especially with what is happening politically right now in the United States, this feels like an important statement that trans people have always existed and aren't going anywhere. It's not an easy book- characters deal with oppression, abuse, addiction, mental health struggles and more. And yet in the midst of everything they find love and joy and ways to live more fully into themselves. While I sometimes found this book to be too slow for my taste and sometimes confusing in terms of the timeline, I love what it's doing and suspect that it's going to somebody's new favorite book. The audio narration is well done, and thankfully we get different voices for the narrator and the pieces written by his father before he died. I received an audio review copy via NetGalley, all opinions are my own."
The Flip Side: A Graphic Novel,Jason Walz,4.09,"This is a fantastic supernatural survival story that deals with the physical manifestation of grief and depression. The graphic novel opens at the funeral of Theo’s best friend, Evan after he’s died of cancer. Theo has a hard time finding the will to go on, and he struggles with his place as Theo’s friend during the aftermath of the death. The resulting spiral sends him into the “flip side” where he meets another teen struggling with grief, Emma. They work together to survive in this upside down world, and there are many tender moments where they. This is such a powerful look at grief and its all-consuming nature. The illustrations are gorgeous, and I love the color palette and how it contributes to the overall moods of the scenes. I cried multiple times throughout the course of the book - there are some really emotional and powerful scenes. If you’re a fan of YA, don’t miss this one.","The Flip Side was a very emotional read. Even more so for me after the passing of my nana last month. I really connected with Theo and what he was going through after the loss of his best friend, Evan, to cancer. The grief and pain was very well written and I liked the concept of the alternative reality, the flip side being the embodiment of his depression. I especially appreciated that the author depicted Theo, Emma, and Bernard’s monsters/(depression differently. Because no one has the exact same experience with grief or depression. On a different note, the artwork itself was stunning. I have several pages bookmarked so I can go back and look at the art again. If you love graphic novels with amazing art and an emotional story I suggest you check out The Flip Side. 3.5 stars Be sure to check TWs *I received an arc copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.*","This graphic novel deals with young death (from cancer) and the grief of those left behind. Theo's best friend Evan has died and along with a deep friendship (and the movie they were working on together). Fourteen year olds aren't meant to waste away and die before their friends and family's eyes.Theo is raw from Evan's death especially as well meaning but unaware family members shunting him out of the house before he can grieve the loss of his friend and his own mother doesn't seem to understand either. Theo wakes up in the Flip side where everything is literally upside down and he is alone.The Flip side is a hell of isolation and loneliness interrupted only by a nebulous monster whispering all your self doubts and fears to you, making them oh so real. The black and white art very much serves the story, making it even more eerie. Before he can realize the danger he's in Theo gets a strange text message telling him to get out of his house.This is how he meets Emma a young girl who's been here longer than he has and has some working idea of how to survive in the Flip Side. Emma has issues of her own, growing up in a group home with some obvious neurodivergence and mental health issues. She tries to keep him and her safe even though she's pricklier than a hedgehog and not nearly as cuddly. Theo clings to her at first out of desperation and then out of true friendship as he doggedly pursues an escape that Emma has given up on. And dogged is a good word choice because one of the way Emma wards off the thought-monsters after them is thinking about/talking about Scooby-Doo fan theories and fanfiction (which is so endearing)It was written out of the author's own pain of losing his friend to cancer (at a later date than Theo did) and it comes across well. Grief and mourning are never straightforward or easy and they can easily become monsters. I thought this was well done.I won this in a goodreads giveaway which in no way influenced my review."
A Palace Near the Wind,Ai Jiang,3.34,"In a Nutshell: A high-fantasy novella about a Tree-like girl seeking revenge against a human. The first of a duology. Grand world-building, okay character development, amazing themes, slow pace, lyrical writing. This could have been a single novel instead of a pair of novellas.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview: Liu Lufeng is the eldest princess of the Feng, nature-loving and tree-resembling forest dwellers. Because of her grandmother’s insistence on her duty, Lufeng is the next bride of the human king. The bridewealth of their proposed wedding is the only way to ensure a future for Feng by stopping the unbridled human expansion into Feng land. Feng has already lost four family members to the king. So Lufeng has a secret agenda – she will kill the king to stop his devious plans. But when she reaches the palace of the human king, she realises that there are many more secrets hidden inside its bone walls, and her earlier plan might not work. How can she save herself, her remaining family members and Feng itself from destruction? The story comes to us in Lufeng’s first-person POV.For a book of just 192 pages, it sure packs in a lot. With various types of character species, a number of characters, multiple distinct localities, allegorical themes, and ambitious worldbuilding, the novella collapses somewhat under its own weight. The allegorical content is fabulous. In a very subtle yet impactful way, the plot covers the modern obsessions with commercialism, technology, and human development, all of which are often at the cost of the natural world. The limitless human greed, which doesn’t think twice about anything except itself, is depicted strongly. The writing is equally excellent. The author’s prose is quite lyrical and vivid, so every single scene comes alive with richness. So much energy has been put in the worldbuilding! However, think of the world building as Google Maps without the ability to zoom in. You can see its immense scope but not the micro-level view of the characters and places except for a few hazy details. Maybe this is revealed in the sequel.The imaginative characters are also the novel’s strength. The residents of Feng, also called Windwalkers for their ability to command the wind, are strange tree-like humanoids. I am stunned by how true-to-life they felt, which is such an odd thing to say about characters who seem like pseudo-Ents in their appearance. That said, actually picturing these beings was a big challenge, especially considering the misleading cover art. The blurb clearly says: “The Feng people have bark faces, carved limbs, arms of braided branches, and hair of needle threads”, and this is further confirmed multiple times in the book. Now look at the picture of Lufeng on the cover and tell me if any part of this description matches the woman there. It is a stunning cover, no doubt. But it seems to indicate some exotic East-Asian fantasy, which this book isn't. The pacing is very much on the slower side. It took me ages to get going as the worldbuilding was too dense, but I did go slightly faster towards the end. On the whole though, the content doesn’t allow you to zoom. Throughout the book, there are plenty of whats and not enough hows or whys. I was hoping at least some of these would be clarified by the ending. But it is rushed, and it leaves us with too many questions. (Heck, I still don’t know why this series is called “Natural Engines”.) The core story arc is not complete by the ending; bad news for those who don’t like cliffhangers.There’s no doubting the imagination and the writing talent of this author. I had first encountered her writing in Linghun, which was also an allegorical story. But unlike Linghun, this book is a proper high-fantasy. And as we know, high fantasy needs space to create the world and fit in its characters. The biggest injustice to this plot was done by whoever decided to make it a novella duology instead of a single novel. Such a complex world and varying character types is too hefty for a short work to do justice to. This novella could easily been doubled in length, such that the plot, the characters, as well as the intricacies of the Feng and other worlds could have had more page space to be crafted in detail. Regardless, I was still captivated by the core plot, the poetic writing, and the allegorical content. I also am curious to see how the story continues and reaches its finale. I’ll probably need to reread this first book when the sequel comes out as it is too convoluted to remember. I just hope the series does end with Book Two and there are no further extensions. Recommended to high fantasy fans who enjoy lyrical writing and don’t mind a slow pace, unanswered questions, or a cliffhanger ending. 3.5 stars, rounding up for the fabulous allegory and the description of the Wind Walkers. My thanks to author Ai Jiang for providing me with a complimentary copy of “A Palace Near the Wind” at my request.

 ||","re-read 05/04/2025It's a little more incesty and vegan propaganda this time around, but I still enjoyed it just as much. This is one of those stories that makes more sense the second go around, so I'm glad I re-read it so I can beta read A RIVER FROM THE SKY. Are you jealous?--Upon receiving my physical ARC, I will need to re-read and annotate. There is a small bit of confusion, but I'm very into the story, just like I've been into Ai's other stories, I AM AI and LINGHUN.I pictured the Wind Walkers as Ents. My other buddy readers picture them differently. Liu Lufeng, eldest princess of the Feng, is the next bride to the human king. Why? What happened to his other brides? Her sisters? Her mother?This is a beautifully woven tale that I'll be happy to explore again. I think it's one of those that will make more sense upon re-read. Looking forward to the second part of the duology.🥃 Take a shot every time you picture an Ent🥃 Take a shot every time Zana says tree fucker🥃 Take a shot every time you want to steal the earth-toned clothes and jewelry📖 Thank you to Titan Books📱 Thank you to NetGalley and Titan Books","★★★★(4.5 Stars)Princess Liu Lufeng, a member of the Wind Walkers, humanoid beings made of wood who live in harmony with nature. She’s chosen to become the next bride of the human king as part of a deal to save her homeland. Lufeng enters the palace with one mission: kill the king and save her people and home. However, nothing is as it seems inside the palace walls, the truth, deception, and difficult choices await Lufeng...This novella completely swept me away. In less than 200 pages, Ai Jiang covered so many heavy themes such as environmentalism, colonialism, and the eternal clash between nature and industrial progress. In Lufeng’s eyes, we witness the closing in of her home, the strength of a people to do what it takes to protect their homeland, and the delicate balance of preservation and change. The worldbuilding is stunning and the concept of the Feng people is both fresh, unique and original. This story felt like something new. Something necessary that will leave you consumed in thought long after you’ve closed the book.Overall this was a refreshing and thought provoking read, and I can't wait for book two.Thank you Titan Books for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."
The Night Alphabet,Joelle Taylor,4.08,"Different countries grow different tongues, but the men all speak the same language, mother said. They all speak the night alphabet. My head cannot understand them. My body understands perfectly. The Night Alphabet by Joelle Taylor is a strikingly original work, written in poetic and powerful prose, what the author has described as ""a sort of weird sci-Fi I’m calling queer futurism.""She held my gaze like it was something injured, twitch-eye and mad with story.It opens with our narrator, Jones, undergoing some sort of transformative time-travel, being in both 2223 but simultaneously a simalcrum of Hackney, 1996:I know where I am. Back. This is the last time; it has to be. I land in myself, running across a trim playing field flanked by holo-graphic London plane trees and analogue tower blocks. The grass beneath my feet is well behaved. Here again. Hackney MunicoPark. The weather programmers have calculated this day to always be the start of Spring here. The children in the overlooking tower blocks might not be able to afford the daily entrance fee to the playground, but they still catch the artificial breezes from it for free, gathered in blue plastic bags. I have grown to love them. At the exit, a soft tide of tattoos materialises across each of my arms. Without looking, I know the tattoos have begun to find themselves again across my body, as though called. The anchor, the fly and the cat, the great net across my belly, the soundwave, the mermaid, the word `mother' in a banner, the map of me. Perhaps I look like a gallery rather than a tattooed woman. Perhaps I am a hanged woman, something to be curious about on Sunday afternoons. Maybe each of the tattoos is a still in the film reel of my existence, my skin a cinema screen.[...]Nearer to Winter now, I bow my head against insistent November rains, the kind that nag the body and worry the heart. Wolves of wind chase my silhouette up the street. The weather programmers are all notorious sadists. Ahead of me the white sun is a baby's head retreating into the womb, and who could blame her? The evening is coming and if I am right, as sometimes I am, it may even come on time. It is strange how the past is always slightly ahead of us, standing on a street corner smoking a cigarette, waiting for us to catch up with what has already happened. I know now that when we leave home, it follows us. There she enters a tattoo parlour run by two women, Cass and a teenager called Small, and asks them to make one last tattoo on her body, a line joining the other designs. And as they do so she tells them the story of each:My first tattoo was a wound, but all the rest have been a healing. Did you know that a tattoo is a series of holes threaded together? What does a necklace of holes make? I think of them as my inside dress, my beautiful wounds. Whatever, I am wearing a suit of holes as I hurry toward the end of the belt. Some are tallies, others are totems. All are archives, books lined up across my body. A love letter to war, a child's handprint. An invented god. A dragon peering between the bars of my ribcage. The threaded outline of a kiss. A caged heartbeat. Angels playing cards in the low light. A ship unzipping the ocean. Each tattoo is a story, a moment pinned to the body. No, not quite: the tattoo is the butterfly unpinned. The overall story she tells is one of how she, and her mother and grandmother before and with her, have an ability to drop into different times and different people, from dystopian features, to 19th century mining communities, and to the (ficticious) Maryville lesbian bar which featured in Taylor's T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry and Polari Prize collection C+nto and Othered Poems. Indeed I believe the story in the novel, in germination for some time, may have come before the poems, with The Night Alphabet itself inspired by Taylor's Songs My Enemy Taught Me, described as ""a collection of back-alley poetry and flick-knife tales detailing Woman’s global struggle against sexual terrorism and colonisation"".The tattoos also function as flags planted in occupied territory - the body of a woman which men try to control. And one common thread that links the stories told by Jones misogyny and male violence (in varied forms) towards women - or is it, or is this simply the story of our world. Towards the end of the tattoo session, Small asks Jones:Why do you only talk about women, though? Why are these stories all about women? I turn to face her, implacable. I am getting bored. It has been a long day, an endless day. The same day. Would you ask that of a fucking man? And anyway, they're not, are they? Not exactly. I examine a new age spot on the back of my hand, a pale brown full stop. My nails need cutting. My fingers are yellowing from holding on to the side of cigarettes as though they are life rafts. The thing is, women are half the planet. We are at least half the story. Cass looks up. You say that, that it's about women, but it's not really true, is it? They're about things that have happened to women—Small interjects.Things that happen to women because they're women, that's the crucial bit. She is right of course, to a degree. But I have no agenda. I am reporting on lives I remember, but whether I am in control of that is debatable. I suppose that being female, I am more drawn to the female experience, but it's not exclusive. I've fallen into the bodies of boys and spent years trying to find my way out. And as the story comes to its conclusion, the link between Jones, Cass and Small - and why she is there - becomes clearer, the lines of a poem, Women Unborn by Anna Swir, a key motif:I am not born as yet,five minutes before my birth.I can still go backinto my unbirth.A strong Goldsmiths Prize contender and one I hope the Booker judges don't overlook (as the Women's Prize judges bizarrly did).And excitingly this is the first of an intended trilogy - with the stories of Jones’s mother and grandmother to follow.","A kaleidoscopic work that is bound together by societal violence against women and odes to the power of storiesMen are broken things, breaking thingsPoet Joelle Taylor starts of The Night Alphabet with a woman, called Jones, who walks into a tattoo parlour in 23rd century Hackney. House music from the 1990s give the place a retro feel (or is there time travel in play?). Jones wants the two shopkeepers to connect her myriad tattoos together. The chapters in the novel alternate between conversations in the tattoo shop and excursions to the past and future of the main character, who “time travels” through remembrance and the power of storytelling.This ranges from stories set in the mines around Manchester, with Winifred “Fred” Welsh who takes the work of her dead father, to a Prophet Song like dystopian and bombed London ruled over by Quiet Men who questions people with Are you English enough to be English?. Gutter girls, taking on gang violence through women cooperating, is uplifting. The gene editing at the end of the novel (with experimental out of body pregnancies, including gene editing to change race of embryos and making babies specific to sex work or being a soldier) reminded me of Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood, also due to a sex trafficking chapter earlier in the novel, while the general writing in terms of lyrical quality and focus on the queer female experience also made me think of Jeanette Winterson. There are chapters on the hiring family members, leading to power imbalances and abuse, a commentary on adoption? We have women literally being erased The Memory Police style with body parts disappearing, including any female depictions in the National Portrait Gallery.While Taylor is excellent in terms of metaphors and the sheer richness of the language, I would have wanted some more variety in narrative voice between the stories. Only the story told from the murderous male intel perspective near the middle of the book was truly very different, in an almost nauseating way. Still this is a daring debut, that shows both ambition and great literary skill. I hope this novel will be recognised and finds its way to more readers!Quotes:God made a mistake, I’m just editing Some of my ancestors are in my futureShe is the colour of a sleepless nightThe way to create eternity is telling a storyIn these clothes I am 6 shillings, without them I am 2.5.In my family people don’t have a gap year, they have unemployment Once upon a time there was no time Patience is the greater part of painBeing violent he expected violenceWhat men do themselves is worse than anything women could conjure.She wears her hair like a hangoverWhen women speak about revenge, they are speaking about survival Our safety was our primary revengeWe understand our oppression when the boot is lifted from the neck, momentarilyEmpathy is the root of intelligence The more people we where the better people we became Bullets are bees pollinating panicOceans are formed from the tears of the drowningLike water, stories can get in anywhereIn a way every woman is a motherWhere do woman go when they are not seen?When a woman says no it is an act of violence","Our veins a map of escape routes across the city. They thought we eroticised danger. We didn't. We eroticised survival. The truth is we were tattooed before we were tattooed.
Admittedly I didn't expect this to be so mind-blowing-ly brilliant (by that I mean in the sense that one doesn't usually have a very high expectation when it comes to 'debut'/first novels) even though I was pretty sure that it was going to be at least 'very good' (knowing that I already like Taylor's poetry). Extremely well-written. And not only is it brilliant, but I think this is such a 'necessary' book. A book 'the world' needs. Sometimes one reads a book (esp. novels) and wonder what the fuck was the point of this being published, you know? But I didn't have to question this one at all. It's glorious in every way. RTC later. Poets (I already like) writing novels? I'm so here for it (the last one I read before this being Andrew McMillan's Pity - and interestingly, both of them wrote about (albeit different) 'mining' accidents, or more precisely, disasters). 
'The cyber night of Hackney is replaced by the indifferent afternoon of a Northern mill town. I have never known grey to be so beautiful, so full of ideas—The television talks to itself, as it does more and more these days. The radiator tuts.''The truth is you must be everyone in a story to understand the story. The victim becomes the perpetrator, the liar is lied to. How else are we to learn except through vicious unlearning? The threads are unpicked, and painfully. All those tiny holes. All those tiny mouths. I balance on the edge of holes looking down knowing one day I might be looking up. How easy it is to fall into yourself. How hard it is to climb out.'"
One Level Down,Mary G. Thompson,4.13,"At first I was a little worried that this would be icky weird, but I promise it was not! It was just good-weird, which we all love, right? What if everything was just a simulation? Only, even in a simulation, sometimes the wrong dude is in charge (and he is probably some terrible white guy who is not really smart but thinks he is and he just ends up ruining everything, sounds familiar...). And Ella has to bear the brunt of it, being the perma-daughter to this madman. It is as thought-provoking as I'd hoped, if not even more so. I mean, haven't we all wondered if we were secretly stuck in a simulation? (And like, not a well-organized one at that.) It is likely a more helpless feeling than things just being all random, honestly. I couldn't stop thinking about it all! Plus, the story itself is so entertaining and readable, because obviously you need to know what becomes of Ella, how things got to this point, etc. So many questions! And they're all answered satisfactorily, though the author does leave room for revisiting the world someday, which she mentions she'd like to do (and I would like her to, also). Bottom Line: One of my favorites of the year so far, incredibly thought provoking while still being immersively entertaining.You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight","What a wonderful novella! Excellent on every level. I may be rating this particularly highly because I’ve read some real stinkers recently, but man, it’s so nice to read something by an author that has a good grasp of basic concepts like “pacing” and “dialogue that doesn’t read like it was written by an alien who doesn’t quite get what humans speak like”.The concept and worldbuilding are strong (even more so with the twist halfway through). I loved Ella as a character. The way she reacts to the horror of her situation was just chilling, and I’ll have to pass this along to a friend who is very interested in children’s rights, because Ella’s experiences line up with things I’ve heard from her. The supporting cast is well done; they obviously aren’t as fleshed out as characters in a novel would be, but they work for what this is. I particularly like the ambiguity of Phil’s character, which I won’t get into deeply here for spoiler reasons, but she does a really admirable job of making a character who objectively sucks but has a reason for why he sucks. The story is perfectly paced and works great as a novella (though to be clear, I would absolutely read a novel about Ella and/or this world). It can be a bit explicit with its theming at times, but I found that forgivable. I hope Thompson writes more in this setting, or at the very least writes more for adult readers.Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC!",The ending of this strange sci-fi was so rushed it was like the author couldn't be bothered to finish it. Everything interesting about this story happened off-page.
The Others,T.C. Weber,4.70,"The Others is a science fiction action adventure set mainly under water around the Florida Keys.The story opens in the aftermath of a hurricane; a body of a teenager has been found and it is rather unusual as the humanoid has webbed hands and feet and several other curious attributes. Marine biologist Will Myers is initially asked for his scientific opinion.Andreia fears that the body found after the storm is that of her lost brother. After her positive identification of the deceased, she arranges his cremation, asking Will to help her make the process as easy as possible. Will is intrigued by Andreia and tries to find out more about her.Meanwhile, in the news, oil stores in Saudi Arabia have been sabotaged which are followed by more attacks across the globe.Will’s curiosity about Andreia brings them together and he agrees to help her find out what happened to her brother. However, Andreia must first persuade her clan to accept Will, which requires a good amount of trust from them both.The premise of this story intrigued me as did the Florida underwater setting and the opening chapters drew me in. Once they go underwater to meet Andreia’s clan there is a lot of world-building and multiple characters to take in. This was where I found myself juggling to keep all the people, actions and story threads going. Also Will and Andreia took on heroic attributes on several occasions which I thought needed a bit more work to make them all believable.","A solid narrative driven by an indelible cast, “The Others” by Ecologist T.C. Weber is his latest offering involving an offbeat story primarily set in the Florida archipelago. When medical examiner, Eloise Clark calls upon marine biologist Will Myers for assistance related to his expertise, Will has no idea what to expect. After a hurricane, a male teenager’s corpse had been washed ashore with mysterious underwater adaptations and Eloise believed his expertise would shed some light on the mysterious phenomenon.A few days later, Andreia Alvarez, a young, enigmatic woman, arrives to claim her brother’s body and asks Will for assistance in identifying the person responsible for his passing. As they grow romantically interested in one another, their relationship strengthens from their initial acquaintance. Andreia introduces Will to her underwater home, a clandestine society of Sea-Dwellers with webbed fingers and toes. These communities were forced to isolate after the majority of their kin were wiped out by contagious diseases, opting to remain permanently underwater. They discover a secret plot that might endanger marine life, including all of the Sea-Dwellers, as they collaborate to reveal the hidden facts surrounding the death of Andreia’s brother Galen.As the title implies, “The Others” is an immersive science-fiction ode that primarily focuses on the amazing underwater world. Weber skillfully demonstrates his mastery of this subject by incorporating sea-punk and fantastical elements throughout. As he assists us in realigning our understanding of nature, he addresses intricate environmental issues such as biodiversity loss, resource depletion, and declining water quality. What follows after mining the subtle prescient warnings that the book presents is a moment of reflection for anyone who puts their hands on his book on the role we can play in solving environmental problems.The slow-burn romance between Will and Andreia feels earned and authentic as it builds in readers’ minds effortlessly. The author avoids the nerdy approach of education by taking us beneath the waves and into the little-known oceanic realm, undoubtedly demonstrating the significance of marine life while incorporating his professional expertise and knowledge into the work. Science fiction enthusiasts will delight in this timely and fast-paced narrative that has an informative arc to it as well.","This book is a portfolio displaying author Ted Weber’s scientific pedigree. As someone who enjoys the ocean and has a strong appreciation for science, the theoretical elements in the story emphasize the author’s diligence in creating conditions that lie within the realm of imagination. I do not disparage fantasy at all, as it is a genre I enjoy, but sometimes reading material that draws from more analytical and academic sources scratches a prolonged itch, particularly one triggered by an ever-present curiosity about the world around us.Some parts of the story challenged me—I am not well-versed in the world of Information and Technology—but I welcomed the opportunity to expand my horizons by pulling up a few glossaries on the topic and wildly switching between apps so I could keep up with the fast pace of the writing.Each chapter was plot-driven, containing more than enough mystery, intrigue, and action to keep you hooked as the hours slipped by imperceptibly, almost criminally so. It was hard not to let responsibilities fall by the wayside as I got sucked in deeper with every twist and turn. The events that take place within the span of the book so closely mimic those in real life that readers feel as though they must complete the story in the hopes of retaining a slice of the future, carrying it with them to the present to mend whatever you can preemptively, before the state of the world falls into further disarray than it already rests in, no matter the cause—the Karsk or the continued selfishness of humanity.The little consumerist devil perched on my shoulder resents the fact that good writing takes time. I do hope to read another tale of the Ahta. T.C. Weber has unlocked a world of storytelling opportunities that many would be keen to follow.Reviewed By Chantal"

The Eye of the Bedlam Bride,Matt Dinniman,4.67,NEW ACHIEVEMENT!!!You found another installment in one of the best book series out there! Reward? The book is the reward. That and Carl's sensual feet,"When I try to describe these books, the best description I can come up with is…imagine a disaster that forces almost everyone on earth underground to endure 18 floors that each act like a different arena in the Hunger Games. Everyone and everything is trying to kill you, and so the population of the planet plummets floor by floor. It’s televised so there’s all the drama that comes with having to “perform” while surviving, including getting sponsors, meeting TV hosts, etc.But as this is on display to the GALAXY, in addition to the crazy cruelty of this game, there are intergalactic politics between alien species, and over time we learn about them through the pov of the main human character. Speaking of the main character and if we stay with the Hunger Games comparison, Carl is Katniss on steroids. He not only wants to survive but to fuck. things. up. Speaking of fucks, there are a lot of them because these are adult books with adult humor. Oh, and also a talking cat...with a pet dinosaur. The stakes are HIGH, the drama in INSANE, the humor is BOMBASTIC, and every book keeps getting crazier and crazier without losing the thread. Each one expands on the lore in a mystery box way that’s highly interesting, hilarious, and engrossing.And THIS ONE is the best one yet.","5 starsThis installment was by far the best yet! The humor was spot-on, and the chaos was next level. The totems were wild, every single one brought its own ridiculous twist, and I was either laughing or shaking my head the whole time. Between demons, slugs, and strippers, the story just kept upping the craziness. And, of course, Carl and his chaotic team, Donut and Samantha, delivered non-stop.But what set this one apart was the added depth. The series has always been funny, from book 1 to book 5, but this time, there were moments that hit a bit deeper, and I even found myself a little emotional. Then, before I knew it, I was laughing again.There was nothing I didn’t love about this book. Absolute chef’s kiss. And I couldn’t ask for better timing, because book 7 just dropped! I’m diving straight in. Cannot wait!"
A Psalm for the Wild-Built,Becky  Chambers,4.24,"If this is not your first Becky Chambers book, you know what to expect. Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she’s been writing what I can only call “comfort science fiction/ cozypunk”, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that’s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, “For anybody who could use a break.”
 “This had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.”
  
It’s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times.
 “I’m tired,” Dex said softly. “My work doesn’t satisfy me like it used to, and I don’t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I’ve done it, I don’t know what to do next. I don’t know what I thought I’d find out here, because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I can’t stay here, but I’m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I’m scared, and I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
In this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other’s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  
This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato’s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea.
 “You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”
This is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia — and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers’ planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs.
 “Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.”
Yes, the questions Chambers raises are those “first world problems” that I’m usually the first one to want to shrug off — but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone — once that basic need has been fulfilled.
“Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”
All in all, it’s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day — but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  
————And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It’s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything — speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot — implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that “We don’t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value” — but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending — or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After “Ancillary Justice” series, I’m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant — that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It’s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it — Panga is pretty much “Pangaea”, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course — but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don’t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that’s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn’t among them. Maybe I’ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. 
“The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”“That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

Fugitive Telemetry,Martha Wells,4.30,"2021 is looking to be a pretty special year. No, I don’t mean the vaccine, although that’s pretty amazing. No, I mean Murderbot is back in a solid novella. While I’m contractually bound to not repeat the approximately 80 highlights I made while reading, I can assure you that it is filled with ‘Bot’s trademark sarcastic thoughts on humans, slow thought processes, and complicated facial expressions.""Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.""In Fugitive Telemetry, ‘Bot is on Preservation Station and has recently discovered a dead–cough, deceased–human. This is odd, because they appear murdered on a station with a threat assessment of 7% “(to make it drop lower than that we’d have to be on an uninhabited planet.)” ‘Bot jumps right into the investigation, spurred on by concern that GrayCris might be involved. In this case, it’s somewhat constrained from using full capabilities due to general unfriendliness of the human Station Security team and its honor system. It has some new humans to work with, although a few of our familiar friends make an appearance. In timeline terms, it takes place before Network Effect.I received notice of my ARC approval after a marathon day vaccinating people (10 stations, 573 people, thank you all very much for getting shots), and while fulfilled, was quite exhausted. I waged a brief debate with myself: do I crash in bed? Do I save it as a reward after I write my two other reviews and finish my two other less-interesting books? Or do I go for it?I think you know what I did.While I read, my day fell away, page by page, replaced by sarcastic observations and extremely dry wit. ‘Bot, how I’ve missed you. “I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit.”The only real question was how long until I re-read all the novellas? Endless thanks to Netgalley and Tor/Forge Books for an ebook ARC. All thoughts are mine (although if you like, we can have a philosophical debate on that one) and all quotes are subject to change.Re-read 10/23 with Nataliya: this is such a tight little tale. Definitely the adolescence of 'Bot's development. ****************Love the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release? Nataliya and I lead a group:https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...","This was exactly what I needed just now to set my life right. I mean, who knew that a pessimistic and grumpy android would end up being such a ray of sunshine that restores my belief in humanity? (Kidding, of course I knew.) (That’s why it seems that every other sentence out of my mouth for the last year somehow included the word “Murderbot” in it.)As I said before, M-Bot is my soul-sibling.
“All I wanted to do was watch media and not exist.”
And this novella did not disappoint, solid and snappy and wonderful. It’s a locked room space station mystery solved by Murderbot. (Which is simply logical.) 

“I had archives of everything that had happened since I hacked my governor module, but I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit.”
Fugitive Telemetry is chronologically set right after the events of the four original novellas and before the events of Network Effect. In it, our favorite pessimistically misanthropic grumpy SecUnit - 
“a construct made of cloned human tissue, augments, anxiety, depression, and unfocused rage, a killing machine for whichever humans rented me, until I made a mistake and got my brain destroyed by my governor module”
 - is on the Preservation Station now, the home of Mensah and the rest of the Preservation survey gang. But although it left Corporate Rim - where, true to the name, corporations rule everything - and is in the place where technically it’s not property, it’s still faced with prejudice, fear and mistrust, as it’s still viewed by most as a murderous tool to be avoided and feared.
“There was a big huge deal about it, and Security was all “but what if it takes over the station’s systems and kills everybody” and Pin-Lee told them “if it wanted to do that it would have done it by now,” which in hindsight was probably not the best response.”
And then Station Security happens across a dead human - an unusual occurrence in a place where your chances of being murdered are on par with those on an uninhabited planet.  
And M-Bot finds itself smack in the middle of murder investigation — and that’s quite good as without our Bot I’d be amazed if any humans managed to survive unscathed even for the time it takes to watch a single episode of Sanctuary Moon.
“Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.”
We have been following Murderbot ever since its escape from corporate slavery, and in this novella we get to see yet another glimpse of this abhorrent practice, as the murder and corporate slavery are very much entangled here. And what I love is that Martha Wells never gets didactic in getting her point across, but knows how to use subtlety and good storytelling to achieve the necessary emotional (ick) response.As usual in her Murderbot novellas, Wells gets the pacing just right. It’s fast when it needs to be, slows down when we need to be treated to longer bits of priceless wry inner monologue, and has action scenes that make perfect sense. Seriously, I’ve read plenty of stories where my eyes just glaze over any time an action scene is on page as descriptions of those can range from dull to incomprehensible — but Wells does those right, easy to follow and actually interesting. And her worldbuilding is excellent — she deliberately gives us what we need to feel comfortable in this world without divulging too much, never overpowering or showing off.(Oh, and did I mention how much I love all the parenthetical asides?) If seeing endless parenthetical asides gets you irritated, you should step away from this book quite quickly. Me - I love them, and paragraphs like this one make me feel all full of warm fluffy feelings (double ick):
“The weapons scanner (which I was not allowed to hack, and which I wasn’t hacking) alerted on me, but it had my body scan ID on the weapons-allowed list so it didn’t set off an alarm. (I have energy weapons in my arms and it’s not like I can leave them behind in the hotel room.) (I mean, my arms are detachable so theoretically I could leave them behind if I had a little help but as a longterm solution it was really inconvenient.)”
  
What I found very well-done is that even seemingly idyllic Preservation society is not an easy place for Murderbot. Yes, Bot is no longer property — but even there humans are conditioned to see it not as a person but a feared murder-machine. And Murderbot by now is really starting to chafe against that because it finally is learning to view itself as a person instead of a disposable feared tool. Nonhuman and dehumanized by societal perceptions — but a person nevertheless. The prejudices it encounters are quite painful, and it keeps coating its pain in sarcastic annoyance — and all together it makes for a pretty powerful and serious effect even when hidden in snarky comebacks. And it’s terrible to read how it’s shot in the back by people he just rescued from a certain death — all because they realized what it is, and it overpowered any common sense or gratitude or decency.
“Aylen looked me over again in that way humans do when they’re trying to intimidate you and they fail to understand you’ve spent the entire length of your previous existence being treated like a thing and so one more impersonal once-over is not exactly going to impress you.”
Oh yeah, and if you ever wondered if Murderbot hangs out with Ratthi — yeah, they juuuust may watch some musical theater together. Which made me grin so happily. Ah Murderbot, you made some friends even if you don’t quite use that word. Friends who see you as a person, respect you, give you space when you need it and help you work through the layers of emotional trauma that your whole existence had been until the events of All Systems Red. And it’s simply wonderful, the found family that it did not even realize it needed.
 Eyeing me, Indah said, “How would you dispose of a body so it wouldn’t be found?” I’m not the public library feed, Senior Officer, go do your own research. I said, “If I told you, then you might find all the bodies I’ve already disposed of.” “It’s joking.” Ratthi managed to sound like he completely believed that. “That’s how it looks when it’s joking.” He sent me on the feed, Stop joking.”
I really hope that Wells keeps writing these, as together they form a wonderful series of episodes of Murderbot Diaries — which I’m as addicted to as M-Bot is to Sanctuary Moon. I need these for my inner balance and reminders of the goodness, integrity and hope that exist in the world. Dear Martha Wells, please never stop adding to this series.
“I know a ‘fuck off’ when I hear one. So, I fucked off.”

Free (Narrator)This Murderbot Diary story takes us to a time before the previous book, when Murderbot is providing protection for Dr. Mensah, despite the reservations of some who are aware that it was a rogue Sec Unit. A body has been found on Preservation Station and the person has been murdered. Rarely are there murders on this station and Preservation's station security needs all the help they can get, despite their reluctance to admit it. So MB is back to having to appease suspicious, unfriendly (but who needs friends), non really up to the task of investigating murders security team. As usual, MB is snarky, funny, and more sympathetic than it'd ever want to admit. Its disdain for all the food crumbs that humans leave in their wake is evident every time it enters a place that humans have been. How is MB going to solve this crime with all the restrictions that humans put on it? Sure, it can get around them but it's made a promise to humans and MB always (maybe, kinda, sorta) keeps its promises.Pub April 27, 2021In the comments, someone asked about when the stories take place so I'm adding a link here to a page that lists the chronological order of the series.https://murderbot.fandom.com/wiki/Cat...Chronological OrderThe series was released out of order compared to its in-universe chronology.

Mickey7,Edward Ashton,3.79,"If I die, you can always make another me.
When I saw the premise for this book, I knew it was going on my TBR posthaste. It sounds so interesting and unlike anything I've come across before.Mickey has the most unusual job: he is expected to risk life and limb to do dangerous work on the space colony. Dying is really no big deal since they can just pump out a new clone of him imprinted with his memories and personality. When a job goes sideways and the colony thinks Mickey7 is dead, they immediately create Mickey8. But the problem is that Mickey7 is still very much alive. Now the two Mickey's are in real trouble. They can't tell anyone that there are two of him running around, for to be a multiple is considered the ultimate abomination, one from which there is no coming back.When I started this book, I had high hopes. Not only is the premise fabulous, but the writing at first glance feels fast-paced and conversational, making this an extremely easy book to get into. I was breezing through the pages, on the edge of my seat, waiting for the story to take a turn into something brilliant.I kept waiting and waiting. And then I reached the end. Welp.The problem is that the story never really goes much past the premise. In fact, most of the conflict comes down to the two Mickey's being hungry. The rest of the time is spent on flashbacks to Mickey's earlier reincarnations and digression on how other space colonies have done on different worlds. It's not that those aren't interesting, but they're just not what I was expecting.The writing style also veers a bit towards the flippant side for my taste. It's lots of slang and jargon, thrown around to make the whole thing feel both casual and authentic. But it didn't quite ring true for me. I've seen comparisons of the narrator's style to Andy Weir, but this isn't The Martian. Mark Watney solves actual problems, while Mickey mostly sounds off.Maybe my expectations were just too high. I thought this would be an insightful and thrilling story, taking me somewhere I've never been before. Instead, the whole story is pretty much the premise. It was a fast and decent read, but I can't help feel it fell short of its lofty potential.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","Mickey7 by Edward AshtonNarrated by John Pirhalla; Katharine ChinUpdate: Mickey7 is now a movie starring Robert PattersonFar into the future we meet Mickey. Mickey7, to be exact. The original Mickey, and those that followed him, are dead. You see, Mickey became an Expendable, back when the original Mickey made a really unwise bet and had to leave his planet immediately. Being a history major, in a day and age where everyone has ready access to any history information they need, did not prepare Mickey for any type space mission related job. Sure, there are openings available on the space flight to Niflheim but Mickey isn't qualified for most of them. There is an opening for the lone Expendable though and no one has applied for that job. Despite the recruiter trying to talk Mickey from taking the Expendable job, due to the horrifying job description, Mickey takes it. How bad can it be?It's bad! Expendables are expected to handle all the deadly missions. There is being a lab experiment, there is repairing things in a radioactive environment, no one wants to be your friend because you are going to die, everyone thinks you must have been an convict on death row and been drafted for the job because who would volunteer to suffer long, slow, agonizing deaths, over and over and over. Thanks to the ability to regenerate original Mickey's body every time a Mickey dies, a new Mickey is made and the past Mickeys' memories are uploaded to the new incarnation. Being ""immortal"" is no fun when you have to go through painful deaths into infinity. But there's another problem. Due to Mickey7's best ""friend"" reporting him dead when he was just kind of lost, Mickey8 is already up and alive. That's not allowed and one of the Mickey's has to go into the recycler pronto. Instead the Mickey's settle on trying to both stay alive without being found out. Not only is Mickey not good at anything but useless history nonsense, he's also not good at being two Mickey's at once. Here's some advice for people in the future...learn a useful skill, don't be a Mickey!

Steven Yeun, Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette starring?!?Holy. Carp.***I RECEIVED A DRC FROM THE PUBLISHER VIA NETGALLEY. THANK YOU.My Review: Well, what can I say. I liked The End of Ordinary: A Novel well enough...inventive use of science, interesting personal stakes, but curiously flat. I wanted to read this book because I loved the science premise (remember Doctor Who's Gangers? My favorite slave race, narrowly displacing the Ood). Also because, well, look at the title of my blog and tell me why I might be interested in the story.I was particularly taken by Mickey7's job on Niflheim, the planet where he...um...where the action takes place. Oh dear...the Spoiler Stasi will be after me...look, I'm kind of hamstrung here by the endless whinging of the spoilerphobes. So, let's just say, if the possibility of knowing something about a read will utterly devastate your pleasure in it, go somewhere else.Mickey Barnes chose life as an expendable because, frankly, it was the best way to get on a colony ship away from Earth. This particular colony ship has religious nuts on it, however, and as is always the way with those sort of people, they've decided their imaginary friend doesn't like...really, hates, though for poorly explored reasons...expendables. They're abominations. After all, I thought to myself, once you're dead, their big bully in the...wait, they're on a a spaceship, where the hell is their gawd in such immense skies? how's she keeping tabs on 'em, some sort of spiritual Ring or Alexa?...anyway, your eternal torments are supposed to begin with death (unless, that is, you're one of Them, and even then it's not 100% guaranteed you'll get the post-mortem goodies). Mickey7, whose previous six deaths were pretty horrific, is still up for doing his job now they're on the ice planet Niflheim. Problem is he's gone and fallen into a crevasse. No one's going to bother rescuing an expendable. That's sort of the point of them...he'll be reconstituted into Mickey8, the cycle will continue.Mickey7's luck is that he survives and makes his way back to the colony, somehow thinking they won't have reconstituted Mickey8. He's handed the religious nut in charge the lever he needs to bludgeon the colony into following his hate-filled plan for the colony to be expendable free. After all, their resources are strained to the limit and, even though expendables get less to eat and fewer material benefits than the religious nuts, they really can't afford another mouth to feed.But someone please explain to me again how religion is a force for good and compassion in the world.What results from this unprecedented situation is a kind of slamming-doors farce, with 7 and 8 agreeing to take on the task of splitting their Mickey-duties to both stay alive; needless to say, that fails. What made it fun to read, and the source of my four-star rating, is the sheer propulsive power of Author Ashton's use of Mickey7 as the first-person narrator. It was immediately clear to me that I was going to be investing in this character. His matter-of-factness was endearing to me, where a more emotionally fraught close third-person narration wouldn't have given me the impetus to keep reading.The filmed version we can expect in, permaybehaps, 2024 is set to star Robert Pattinson and Steven Yeun. Brad Pitt's company is set to produce, and Bong Joon-ho is set to direct. IF, that is, David Zaslav's flensing knife spares the project now that Plan B Entertainment's new home Warner Brothers is owned by his philistine self. Star power isn't much to Discovery, they like cheap and flashy.We'll always have the fun, funny, and very provocative-idea-laden book."
Light Bringer,Pierce Brown,4.76,"This review is a copy of the transcript of my video review on Light BringerLight Bringer is a bloodydamn near perfect space-opera masterpiece. 
“For a friend with an understanding heart is worth no less than a brother. —Homer”
*Clang Clang Clang* Can you hear that? That’s the sound of blades clashing announcing the arrival of Light Bringer as the biggest contender for the best book of 2023. Pierce Brown has done it. I have been a diehard fan of Pierce Brown's Red Rising Saga for almost seven years. My admiration and passion for this series has pushed me to willingly read the series from the beginning again—despite how busy I am—in preparation for the arrival of Light Bringer, the sixth and penultimate volume in the series. Although I have unbridled fondness for the series, I am not afraid to admit my favorite book in the entire series prior to the existence of Light Bringer has always been one of the books in the first Red Rising trilogy. On my first read-through up to Dark Age, Golden Son was my favorite installment. On my second read, Morning Star received an escalation to my favorite instead. And I did have a blast in my second read of Iron Gold and Dark Age as well. Dark Age, in particular, received a significant reading experience upgrade for me. But now that I've read my most anticipated release of the year, Light Bringer, I can say with a shattered and mended heart that is filled with contentment and satisfaction, Light Bringer is my favorite book in the entire series so far. I have no idea how Pierce Brown can top this book in Red God. Light Bringer was just that sublime.
“The path is made of many stones that look all the same. When you trod upon evil, do not rest or look down because goodness is only a step away. The next may bring ruin, the next joy, but these stones are not your destination, they are but your journey to the path’s end.”
Light Bringer begins 8 months after the end of Dark Age, and I strongly believe this is a return to the best of the first Red Rising trilogy while employing the expansive military space opera aspects of  Iron Gold and Dark Age. And more. I have mentioned this in my review of Dark Age. For context, Dark Age is one of the darkest books I've ever read. Brown went all out on the gore, darkness, violence, and bleakness of the circumstances and threats Darrow and his friends faced to mercilessly showcase the darkness and cruelty of war and violence. And Brown succeeded at this. There is nothing wrong with this direction. On my second read, I acknowledge this is a necessary and firm foothold needed to be established for Brown to bring the massive emotional reckonings and self-discovery in Light Bringer. But on that review of Dark Age, especially on my first read without a sign of Light Bringer in sight back then, I felt Brown did not implement his most outstanding gift as a storyteller. That is to mix the themes of hope, friendship, love, and light into the chaos of destruction the characters encounter. This blend of chemistry made the first trilogy shine so brightly in many reader’s hearts. Fortunately, as I said earlier, Brown brought that back in Light Bringer multiply without losing the epic scope he meticulously prepared in Iron Gold and  Dark Age. As Brown himself said. Light Bringer is a book about journeying through darkness toward light, toward home. It is a book about war, loss, and hope, but most of all, it is a book about friendship and how the bonds we make with those we love are stronger than duty, blood, or chains. And Brown is firing on all cylinders here. Lux ex Tenebris. Light comes after darkness.
“I think of the eighth understanding. We achieve perfection first by acknowledging our failures. We increase understanding first by recognizing our ignorance.”
Does it mean Light Bringer is less dark or intense compared to Dark Age? No. I will argue the intensity has been heightened even further. There were many moments in the book where I felt like my heart was leaping out of my throat. Part 1 out of 4 of the novel is relatively safe in tension and heartbreak. But remember, we are in the sixth book of seven in Red Rising Saga. My emotional investment (and I think the same notion is felt by other Howlers) toward the characters is real. Darrow and the surviving characters from the first trilogy are not simply fictional characters. Our affection and worries for them are genuine. A slight damage to them could mean a critical emotional hit for us readers. As we learn from the previous books in Red Rising Saga and many other science fiction and fantasy series, being a paragon of honor and virtue doesn’t immortalize or guarantee peace. War portends death, hatred, and vengeance. To form a unity with an armor of love or to be indivisible and invincible could be tougher than waging vengeance. Especially when Darrow and the characters live in a dehumanized world ruled by a ruthless hierarchy where the rule of might make right is absolute. This is, among many other reasons, why  Light Bringer is so bloodydamn brilliant. The character’s work, characterizations, and development were masterfully written. My mind and heart swirled with fear, anxiety, love, happiness, and sorrow throughout every page. The sense of care I have for the main characters felt too much, and as I saw them constantly endure heavy adversities, it felt like I spiritually persisted with them, too.
“If we demand restitution for all the evils that have been done to us, there will be no end to this war. It will consume us and the people we claim to lead. The future is more important than our wounds… The purpose of war must not be vengeance. It cannot be to kill your enemies until none are left. That is barbarism. That’s how Earth and its multitude of nations strangled itself… The purpose of war must be to find the road back to peace.”
I’ve read more than 600 novels since I read the first Red Rising trilogy for the first time. And the fact that I still regard the brotherhood in Red Rising Saga to be one of—if not—the best portrayal of brotherhood in fiction I’ve ever read is a testament to Brown’s complex, mature, and layered plotting and character motivations. I did mention this at the beginning of this review. Light Bringer brings the series back to its core. In Iron Gold and Dark Age, Darrow is mostly separated from the main characters from the first trilogy. It is why I think there is a bit of a more mixed reception toward both Iron Gold and Dark Age. Even if overall, they were still super positive. But this separation does bring worthy and rewarding payoffs in Light Bringer. I’m trying to not mention the character’s name here to make this review as spoiler-free as possible, but the theme of brotherhood exhibited in Light Bringer was so bloodydamn good. I would consider myself blessed to be able to read more books with this level of believable friendship and brotherhood. With more responsibilities and the march of time, their friendships aren’t as relatively simple as they were before in the first trilogy when they had fewer designated main missions and priorities. The brotherhood between Darrow and his brothers has obstructions, and they are bravely fought for, understood, and nurtured.
“So what you’re saying is, without your friends , you’d be slagged and the Rising would be ashes?... Welcome to the club, asshole. Where do you think I’d be without you? Without our friends? Dead in a ravine, that’s where. We hold each other up. We always have. That’s not weakness. That’s the only strength we’ve got. More than anyone, you’ve been there for me. You’ve been my engine for half a life. My turn.”
Red Rising Saga is still my number 1 favorite sci-fi series. It never feels like work to do a second read of the series from the beginning, and honestly speaking, I am glad I did that before reading Light Bringer. One of my favorite things about Light Bringer is how Pierce Brown totally made sure that crucial and pivotal events from each previous book in the series do matter. A lot. They were established and reflected, and they exponentially enhanced the emotional value I have with the series. When you analyze the storyline and conflicts in Iron Gold up to Light Bringer, especially Light Bringer, you will see many of them are the downfall and results of Darrow’s actions in the first trilogy. And I am not only talking about the endgame in Morning Star, but to mention one, what Darrow decided to do in the Battle of Ilium in Morning Star has a lot of devastating repercussions that can still be felt in Light Bringer. I am so pleased with this storytelling decision. I also think more authors and storytellers should include snippets of recollections or flashbacks like Brown did here. We, readers, have gone through the series from the beginning. In sequels or long series, characters' momentary recollections of the past and their journey can magnificently increase my emotional attachment to the characters and their struggle.
“In the cold prison of our minds, we are alone with our self-hatred, our doubts, and guilt… A friend may reach through the bars and hold our hand, but they cannot open the door for us. Only the prisoner has the key. All I can do is remind him we’re waiting for him when he gets out.”
As a result, for the first time in the series, after all the development, I can now say Darrow has become one of my top favorite main characters. This is new to me. Sevro has always been my favorite character in Red Rising Saga. But Darrow is flawed, and his character's arc and development throughout the series are phenomenal. In Light Bringer, I love reading how Darrow took a step back to observe the unforgettable sins of his past. The weight of his guilt was never neglected, and he took action upon them. It is all so incredible. Brown's multiple first-person narration was compelling and engaging, as always. There were many passages I highlighted because they resonated a lot with me. Although Darrow and Lysander's POV chapters have the most spotlights in Light Bringer, the book or series never felt it was exclusively about them. It is about them, their loved ones, their beliefs, and the ruthless hierarchy of their world. And speaking of Lysander, let me say this... He is one of the most despicable and self-righteous characters I've read in speculative fiction. It takes something special to make me want to put my hand inside the pages of a book to strangle a character, and Lysander has achieved this in Light Bringer. Multiple times.
“Did Silenius and Akari love war? Did they use war to line their own purses, to vent their rage against the ungrateful masses? Or did they wage war to sculpt the chaos natural in humanity into a future of order and prosperity? Our sacred ancestors knew what we have forgotten: that peace, not war, is our sacred calling. That we were to lead by our example, not to be led by our greed, our hunger for power. I look around, and I am humbled by your acts of valor and sacrifice, but we are no longer a people united by our sacrifice or by our convictions. We are united only in our propensity for self-interest, infighting, and greed.
Finally, let’s talk about action scenes. I consider The Battle of Ilium in Morning Star one of the greatest space-opera warfare sequences I’ve ever read. And, of course, Light Bringer won’t reach the critical acclaim it has without the prominent clash of conflicts evident throughout the series. Pierce Brown brought that back again. He features not only one but TWO big battle sequences. And they were absolutely breathtaking. The brutality in The Battle of Phobos was rampant and terrifying. The tone was filled with grim menace, dread, and disorder. And then there’s more… *Clang Clang Clang*. You might have seen those who read Light Bringer mention: “Clang. Clang. Clang.” This is the sound of flashing blades producing a superbly thrilling iconic duel that will be discussed by the Howlers for many years to come. Ashvar is hands down the finest duel scene in the entire series. It was pure energy crystallized by Brown’s narrative. I am in awe. I don’t know how Brown did it. The frantic bedlam and bloodshed he conjures never fails to transport me into his books easily. The free movement in the battle-flow of the breath of stone was incredibly mesmerizing to me. My pulse pounded. I forgot I was reading a book. It was like a vortex of vivid wind had opened its invitation for readers to fly together with the howling lunatics following godkillers in a hunt. I can’t say more than this. If you haven’t read Light Bringer, you will know when you get there. The entire sequence was extremely well-written; I swear any author would be gratified to pen a sequence of chapters reaching that superlative quality. Light Bringer is epic. Also, the three gorgeous maps on the front pages of Light Bringer, illustrated by Joel Daniel Phillips, helped realize the ambitious scope of Brown’s vision in Red Rising Saga.Picture: The Moon Io & The Moon Europa by Jose Daniel Phillips
“So why are we fading? Because we don’t wanna be here. We wanna be on the other side of this shit. We’re waiting to live. But this is it. This is our life until we change it. That’s all right. Like Darrow said, it’s a blessing. It is our privilege to fight. So let’s stop eating ourselves, chewing on each other’s legs. It’s stupid. It’s endless. We got more to do.”
Whether it's the cover art or the content, Light Bringer is the crowning glory of Red Rising Saga. This is an example of a marvelous book that reminds me why I love reading. The resonating themes of camaraderie, family, brotherhood, and hope were precisely combined with the grimness of the fine-tuned actions, sacrifice, and darkness. Light Bringer contains some of the most emotional scenes in the series so far, and believe me, it means a great deal. Especially when you put how many hearts have been broken and repaired by the events in the series into the equation. Light Bringer is the best penultimate book I've ever read out of any series. By bringing Light Bringer into existence, Brown has everlastingly carved his name into the archives of science fiction history as one of the greatest sci-fi authors of all time. Only one book remains. It will be bittersweet to read the series to its completion. And I am not sure how Brown can exceed Light Bringer in Red God. But if anyone can, it would be Howler One. Per Aspera ad Astra.
“I’m not really blessed at keeping friends. But you are. I truly respect that. I know how special your friends are to you, how protective you are of them. And it means…quite a bit to me that you’ve invited me into your pack and made me feel welcome. No…it means everything, really. Without this, without your friends, I’m very much alone. You’ve put a lot of faith in me. Faith that I don’t think I’ve always deserved. I just want to say…thank you, Darrow.”

The man ripped my heart out and left it shattered in a million tiny pieces.,"Full video review here: https://youtu.be/STirP2cBd3YSpoiler discussion (featuring HowlerPod) here: https://youtube.com/live/Sza_p3nhPiQAfter an incredibly long wait, Light Bringer is finally here. I had my fingers crossed for an ARC but the publisher ghosted me for whatever reason. But when I had Pierce Brown on the channel he said “I got you” and that he did. I was sent an uncorrected proof by Pierce personally in exchange for an honest review. With so much time between books the theory crafting and speculation can go a little crazy. 4 years is a long time but definitely not in the Song of Ice & Fire kinda long wait that made my theories and speculation dry up. I had many coming into this book and I gotta say; I was wrong on all of them. What Pierce has done in this book is take the series back to its roots in that this is Darrow’s book. One of the gripes in Iron Gold and Dark Age was too much time away from the OG. Darrow gets the bulk of the page time outside of one stretch in part II where he’s gone for almost 100 pages. But trust me, it’ll be worth it. We spend so much time with Darrow and his companions (you’ll find zero spoilers here!) that you feel a bond like you haven’t felt those early days back at the Institute. Pierce gives me some team ups and group adventures I’ve been waiting for since Golden Son. And it’s just special. On the other hand, I do wish we had gotten more Victra and Kavax in this one. Part II has maybe the biggest space battle the series has ever had and it’s amazing, but if you’re hoping for a lot of Victra like we had in Dark Age you might be missing her a little. Characters go MIA the second half of the book but I think it’s for good reason. The events happening in each Part (4 parts in total) are paced in such a way that to hop across the solar system might be a little jarring. When you’re in a massive space battle, the last thing you want is to jump to another location for a territory dispute. Less hopping makes the book more cohesive but you will miss some of those side characters for long stretches. I don’t like to say too much, but the last 50 pages of Light Bringer hit me harder emotionally than any other similar stretch in the series. While I didn’t sob I will say that I rolled a manly tear but if I wasn’t at my office I may have wailed. Pierce continues to write a sci-fi epic that hits emotionally every bit as hard as he does with his action (clang clang clang! …you’ll see 😏). That’s what makes this series so special. In the end, he always examines his characters humanity and what makes them tick. For those worried this will feel like a “bridge” or set up book, fear not. Pierce has delivered another stunning volume to what is my favorite modern sci-fi series and has taken things in a direction I didn’t expect but I’m anxious to see the conclusion for in Red God. Pick this one up on day one because you don’t want that final act spoiled for you. Hail Reaper."
The First to Die at the End,Adam Silvera,4.00,"lmao i finished this masterpiece and now i’ve been staring at walls for hours just thinking about what i just read.just like “they both die at the end” this prequel has multiple narrators but the main ones are Orion and Valentino. and they are some of the most real and deep characters. the timeline for their story is when Death Cast is being introduced and tried for the first time. we see a lot of doubt within almost every character for the trueness of the death cast system. like “does it actually work?” , “there’s gotta be errors in the system,” as many think. it was even more interesting reading from the pov of the death cast creator, Joaquin.just like TBDATE this one was emotional and bittersweet towards the end. tears soaking the page type of shit. i will say, i appreciated how this work wasn’t a repetition of TBDATE, it fully stands on its own as a unique story set in the death cast world. the writing is captivating. and obviously fans of TBDATE will love this but surprisingly i can also see people that didn’t like that book like this oneand side note but we get 1 Mateo and Rufus pov in this one and i fully trained my brain into believing that they’re still breathing alive and well 🤧🤧🤧",i wanted them to die quicker.,"YES I CAN’T FUCKING WAIT YESTheories:• I WILL cry• Mateo and/or Rufus cameo (or of their family, depending on much earlier the book takes place)• More detail on Death-Cast and how they knows who dies (seriously HOW THE FUCK DO THEY KNOW?)• MC relative of one of the side characters..?• LGBTQ+ and BIPOC rep obviously• Pain• More pain"
Sea of Tranquility,Emily St. John Mandel,4.06,"One of my most anticipated new releases of the year, Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel, turned out to be a watered-down rewrite of Cloud Atlas. If I were David Mitchell, I don't know whether I'd feel flattered or just profoundly ripped off.Sea of Tranquility has exactly the same narrative structure as Cloud Atlas, consisting of interconnected stories that occur across different timelines, starting in the past and spanning into the future. Like Cloud Atlas, the opening storyline centers on a seafaring scholar traveling to the New World, whose ""street smarts"" pale in comparison to his ""book smarts."" Like Cloud Atlas, the next storylines involve a composer, an author, and a projection into a sci-fi future. Like Cloud Atlas, each storyline is interrupted partway through to begin the next nested story, and then all the stories wrap up in the second half of the book. The main difference is that the nested stories in Sea of Tranquility are only four layers deep, rather than six layers deep in Cloud Atlas.Emily St. John Mandel's writing is beautiful, as usual. However, she uses exactly the same writing style for all storylines covering three hundred years of history. The same 2020 writing style is applied to the historical account from 1912 and to the futuristic stories taking place in 2203 and 2401. She doesn't even attempt to alter her writing style to reflect these time differences. This is in sharp contrast to David Mitchell, who dramatically adjusted his writing style to reflect each different time period. This included making a projection of how he thought the English language would evolve in the near and far futures. Mitchell accomplished this task brilliantly, although it certainly made Cloud Atlas more difficult to read than Sea of Tranquility. In this way, the writing in Sea of Tranquility is simultaneously beautiful and lazy. I wish Emily St. John Mandel would have tried harder to capture the differences in writing style that one would expect over a span of 300 years.Like David Mitchell, Emily St. John Mandel is attempting to build an interconnected universe of characters spanning across books. However, the execution is quite clunky in Sea of Tranquility. The 2020 timeline overlaps with her previous novel, The Glass Hotel, and unfortunately the characters in the 2020 timeline of Sea of Tranquility spend about half of their dialogue recapping key plot points from The Glass Hotel. Also, the interconnections among the nested stories of Sea of Tranquility are made using a rather unconvincing time travel plot device, in contrast to the more subtle connections that David Mitchell provides in Cloud Atlas.I really wanted to love this book. I gave five stars to The Glass Hotel, which was brilliant in its subtle use of magical realism. Emily St. John Mandel's previous post-apocalyptic novel, Station Eleven, was also vastly superior to Sea of Tranquility. I preordered Sea of Tranquiltiy months in advance, in eager anticipation of its release date. This was such a letdown. I would have been far better off just rereading Cloud Atlas.","“Isn’t that why we’re here? To leave a mark on wilderness?”
I was one of the few readers (or so it seemed) left underwhelmed by Mandel's Station Eleven when I read it back in 2014. The hype and gushing reviews seemed at odds with the very okay novel I read, which is why I passed on reading The Glass Hotel.Now I'm wondering: should I go back and read the author's other stuff? Because I have to admit I found Sea of Tranquility riveting and beautiful.From what I remember, it is not stylistically that different to Station Eleven-- both are quiet, slow-build stories-- but I found the characters here fascinating and the exploration of both the simulation theory and what, if anything, that means for humans, deeply moving. We begin with several chapters (or ""Parts"") of seemingly unrelated characters and stories, each set in a very different time and place-- Edwin arrives in Canada in the year 1912, Mirella goes to speak to the brother of an estranged old friend in 2020 NYC, Olive visits Earth for a book tour in 2203, scientists investigate the theory that the world is a simulation in 2401. Similar motifs appear in each story and it is clear they are linked, but how?As the stories weave together and overlap, we begin to see the recurring theme in each one until it all comes together in a big picture at the end.I really enjoyed it. There is this nostalgic quality to Mandel's writing that made me feel like I was revisiting places I'd been long ago, even though I obviously hadn't. I don't know if all the pandemic subplots were strictly necessary and I think the author could have achieved the same goal without that being a recurring theme, but this is a small complaint. The novel touches upon the big questions like the meaning of it all and the nature of reality, as well as exploring the human obsession with the end of the world:
“I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.”
And, in the end, it all seems to be saying that maybe there is no meaning, maybe none of it's real, whatever that means, maybe the world is always ending, and maybe the real question is: does it even matter?","i do not know how to review this book.https://emmareadstoomuch.substack.com...even at the best of times, when i am absolutely on the ball and everything is perfect and life is going my way and i am organized and well stocked in cookies and persian cucumbers (the two best foods), the very best i can hope for in terms of how much time passes between when i read a book and when i review it is 3 weeks.but that's beside the point, because we are firmly in the two month category on this one.i just...don't know how to do it. i've never READ anything like this - how would i know how to write about it?this is just so stunning. so lovely.the simulation theory and the corresponding idea of SO WHAT, to put it as basically as possible, are two things that have always fascinated me, and now here i find them transcribed so lovingly???at first i didn't know if i'd like this book - doubted i would, really - as characters from the glass hotel popped up but wow. how different. the two couldn't be more dissimilar.which is a compliment.bottom line: a really good book with a perfect ending.(update: raising to 5 stars 6 months later because i can't stop thinking about this book)------------------reread updatedoing the normal thing i do where i reread a book i think is a 5 star almost immediately as some kind of weird gobliny test------------------pre-reviewoh, gosh. life is so lovely.review to come / 4.5 or 5 stars------------------tbr reviewwill this be a perfect glorious beautifully written book i never stop thinking about (station eleven) or a confusing mess that makes me almost inexplicably mad (the glass hotel).only one way to find out"
Annie Bot,Sierra Greer,3.83,"the future is scarier than any horror movie <3this is a creepy sci-fi book and also an intense allegory for emotionally abusive relationships and also a damning exploration of misogyny all in one.it's a book about a dystopian future in which men see women as only good for sex, homemaking, or parenting. in other words, our present day reality. (buh dum ch.)reading this unrelentingly icked me out and made me feel grateful for my sentience and freedom, like when you have a cold and your nose is stuffed and you're like ""i'll never forget to appreciate clear nasal passageways ever again.""i enjoyed the fact that this book did not pander or condescend to its audience in its themes, and granted the reader the ability to pick up on what was going on most of the time on their own. (although i did not enjoy the moments when it had our protagonist provide a neat summary of something that had been going on for hundreds of pages. or understand why there was a moment when a random woman was outed (?) as trans.)it pulled its punches sometimes and felt overzealous at others, but overall this book was cool and impressive and skin crawly. in a good way.bottom line: i hate modern life.(thanks to the publisher for the e-arc)","this was such a fascinating character study that examines womanhood, autonomy, control, and emotionally abusive relationships. it reminded me of my first relationship where i lacked a sense of identity, received criticism when i showed humanity, and had a constant fear of displeasing him. big oof.","She has been happy here, and anxiously miserable, but she has never been free.
It seems like interest in recent developments with AI is fostering a resurgence in AI fic. And this particular premise-- a look at AI sex robots --seems to be following me. In the past few months, I have read Hey, Zoey (which I didn't rate) and The Hierarchies (which was pretty good, though took some weird turns at the end).Annie Bot is similar to The Hierarchies, though I think it makes for a more interesting character study. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy contemporaries exploring relationship dynamics; I would not be quick to give this to a sci-fi lover. I actually found myself comparing this favourably to Klara and the Sun. While it has no chance of getting anywhere near the same level of attention, I found this to be a better and far more interesting book.It's a look at relationships, romance and love. Annie is both an outsider observing human nature, and also someone with a developing humanity of her own. Greer peers, through a third person limited perspective, at the nuances of human relationships. Ultimately she asks if love, or indeed consent, is ever really possible when one person has control over the other.
He is the only star in their system, she realizes. He has no competition, no need to listen to Annie like she’s her own protagonist because she’s not.
There is a powerful moment when one side character observes that Doug may control Annie's body but he cannot control her mind... and rather than leaving it hanging on that note, the author later pauses to let Annie consider whether having complete control over someone's body and behaviour is not a form of mind control also.At times, the book is extremely discomfiting to read. Those sensitive to scenes of emotional abuse should steer clear. There were moments in the story when I was literally grimacing to myself and at one point I typed a note saying just ""god, this is horrible.""I think the science was where my suspension of disbelief was challenged the most. Annie is a sex robot, made to cater to Doug's every whim, but I didn't understand some of the decisions made by her creators. I understand why she can simulate orgasm, but not why they created her with an actual libido that could make her very sexually frustrated. I don't understand why she is able to feel pain, especially as she is made to not be able to feel cold. At one point she says her heart rate is elevated, which is... strange. Why give her one? Perhaps the author was keen to convince us of Annie's humanity with these details, but I don't think it was necessary. Without heartbeat, pain or libido, Annie was still an absolutely fascinating character who I felt deeply for. I hope Greer writes more."
The Last Murder at the End of the World,Stuart Turton,3.67,"I feel like this is a book best read two or even three times, because just once left me rather confused.Looking at the title of this book, perhaps you'd immediately guess that it's about two things: a murder, and the end of the world. And you would be right. And as is usually the case when a book is about two things, one ends up being more successful than the other.The first half of this story focuses on the end of the world, and that was my favorite part of the book. I was absolutely riveted, turning the pages as fast I could, trying to figure out what was going on. There was this rather sinister feeling throughout, as if you know something wasn't quite right, but you can't put your finger on what exactly. And the more we learn, the stronger that feeling got. I totally ate it up. Then about halfway through, we arrive at the murder as well as some revelations about the end of the world, and that was truly a satisfying ""ah ha"" moment for me. It was the highlight of the book, and so much of what had been hinted at thus far slotted into place. But soon after, it started to go off the rails a bit. I went from being absolutely glued to my seat to quickly losing interest. I think it's because we switched into murder investigation mode, and that arc just wasn't as compelling. There were so many details and people, too many to really keep track of in my head. I kept forgetting who the characters were and how they related to each other. As small revelations appeared, only to twist upon itself later, then twist upon itself again, I just could not keep it all straight.And not being able to remember really hindered my enjoyment. There were so many moments when a character would mention a fact or a relationship, and I would have to pause, desperately searching my memory for this morsel of information I should've known, only to come up empty. These pauses really took me out of the story and prevented me from being fully immersed in the mystery.The other thing that constantly felt a little bit off was the story's simultaneous use of the 1st person and 3rd person narrator, which I've never seen done before (maybe with good reason). I kept being vaguely confused, uncertain if we're reading about a character's true feelings or our omniscient narrator's interpretation of them. And maybe there is no real difference between the two at the end of the day, but that dissonance gnawed on me. I'll be honest, I think the writing and editing contributed to these issues. The story isn't that far off from being easier to understand, if only some of the more convoluted plot developments were pared back and the writing polished up for clarity. It's a shame the book went out the door as is, so close to being amazing and yet falling short of that lofty goal.It seriously pains me that I can't seem to give Stuart Turton's books more than 3 stars. His premises are always amazing, and there is so much potential embedded in the pages. And yet, the execution is just a smidge too complicated and tortuous, leaving me feeling like I've gone through several rounds of plot-gymnastics rather than just being able to sit back and enjoy the stories for what they are.Still, that being said, it's not going to stop me from reading more of Stuart Turton's books. So there you go.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧","Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far... While it's an interesting premise in theory, the execution was all over the place and got boring very quickly. I only finished because I had enjoyed his other work.Don't recommend.Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...","In Stuart Turton's latest masterpiece, ""The Last Murder at the End of the World,"" readers are plunged into a gripping whodunit set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world. The story unfolds on an idyllic island, the last refuge in a world decimated by a deadly fog, where survival is contingent on solving a murder that could expose the inhabitants to the same deadly fate that befell the rest of the planet.The island, sheltering 122 villagers and three scientists, seems like a peaceful haven, but the murder of one of the revered scientists sends shockwaves through the community. With a ticking clock of 92 hours, the islanders must unravel the mystery, as failure to do so will result in the encroaching fog swallowing everything in its path.What sets Turton's narrative apart is the ingenious use of an amnesia plot device. The island's security system erases everyone's memory of the night of the murder, turning each inhabitant into a potential unwitting killer. The tension escalates as the protagonist, Emory, takes on the challenge of solving the murder with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.Turton's storytelling prowess shines through as he seamlessly blends elements of mystery, science fiction, and dystopian fiction. The island, described with vivid detail, becomes a character in itself—idyllic yet eerie against the backdrop of the fog-shrouded world outside.The countdown of 92 hours adds urgency to the narrative, propelling readers through short, addictive chapters that unveil twists and turns. The characters are fully fleshed out, and Emory emerges as a tenacious and relatable heroine, driving the story forward with her quest for the truth.Turton's ability to navigate the complexities of the plot and intertwine genres is commendable. ""The Last Murder at the End of the World"" is not just a murder mystery; it's a survival tale, a psychological thriller, and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.Overall, Stuart Turton's latest novel is a triumph of storytelling, combining intellectual stimulation with emotional engagement. For fans of innovative mysteries and science fiction, this book is a must-read, promising an enthralling journey that challenges the boundaries of conventional genres. Get ready for a wild ride that will keep you guessing until the very end.Many thanks to NetGalley and SOURCEBOOKS Landmark for sharing this amazing book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter"

But it's a fun and propulsive read that doesn't take much brain power and will make you look chic and mysterious when you carry this around in your tote bag.—-i once dated a gay priest so I feel exceedingly qualified to give romance novels like this the spotlight they deserve <3","4.5 stars rounded up.I've never related more to a fictional character. Minus the plane obsession, of course. Although, I will admit that I've checked FlightRadar24 slightly more obsessively than the usual person.Linda is me and I am Linda. Awkward, aloof, and a tad bit more blunt than what's considered socially acceptable, I found a kinship in the FMC as the novel went through her day-to-day life. This would sound boring if it weren't for the writing style, tone of voice, and how eerily dark the entire story turned out to be. The vibe was very satirical (I'm not sure if that's actually one of the genres?) and I'm a huge fan of satires. It reminded me of how I felt reading Yellowface and The Eyes Are the Best Part (no discussions on race in Sky Daddy though), both of which were instant favorites. They're all filled with over the top ridiculousness, tinged with a layer of darkness, and I couldn't stop reading. Hell, I might as well add Sky Daddy to my Favorites list.Kate Folk's prose is both witty and very easy to read. I had such a fun time reading this ridiculous book that I found it difficult to put down. I don't think I've ever highlighted so many lines that made me chuckle or snort, so kudos to the author! The similes and analogies were laugh out loud funny, although YMMV. Sadly, since I read the arc seven months before pub date, I have to refrain from posting direct quotes. But I'll definitely update this review when the book comes out.If you like dark and funny novels, this might be right up your alley.Thank you to Random House and NetGalley for this arc."
All Superheroes Need PR,Elizabeth  Stephens,4.08,"I consumed this book and added it to my favorites list for 2025 by 50% in. It’s emotional, hilarious, swoony, and sexy.I NEED this to be an entire series with all the characters and all the HEAs. I fell in love with this new world from Elizabeth and want to dive back into it immediately.This isn’t just a recommendation, I’m throwing this book at you so that you'll read it and enjoy it !!","Action alien romcom in the vein of superman. Two decades ago, people with powers fell to the Earth and either became heroes or villains. It falls to PR director Vanessa to rebrand one very broody bad guy into a hero. First of all, what a RELATABLE main character. As someone who also works a lot with marketing, a lot of people expect me to be really sociable and happy around big groups of people. Not exactly… I love seeing my efforts out there, I love the content, I love meeting with people individually. Put me in a room with a bunch of strangers where I have to make small talk and I would rather be curled up in a corner with a book. This is like insta everything which is cringy, but hey, sometimes you can overlook it. Especially when dealing with alien hormones. Roland was a super strong, growly, big, gruff hottie. Fair warning: there is A LOT of sexy, dirty talk. For me, it was waaay too cringy and not for me. In the ‘good girl’ vein. There were A LOT of steamy scenes. I had not expected as many as this seemed more sweet and cutesy. I did want more of the whole PR context as, after the first 25%, this is pretty much chucked out the window in favour of domineering male scenes. Like alpha style. I can’t say I was a big fan of the conflict or climax, but I loved the premise and Vanessa’s character and growth. And her large adoptive family were INCREDIBLE. Finally, the effortless representation?! Immaculate. Queer. Trans. Ethnicity. Family structures. Audiobook arc gifted by publisher. BookstagramTiktok","I only read Elizabeth Stephens for the first time earlier this year with The Bone King and the Starling, and she has very quickly become one of my absolute favorite authors. One of the things I loved most about Starling, and now Supers, is that Stephens challenges me on the front of disliking instalove/instalust. I still think I dislike it, but paired with Stephens' fantastic writing, comedic timing, and dynamic—albeit unhinged—characters, I think I can more than tolerate it. And dare I say I loved it?! She also pushes me to read outside of my comfort zone. I am still relatively new to reading adult fantasy/romantasy and I am even more new to monster romance/alien romance, and I ate every piece of this right on up. Decades ago, 48 aliens landed on Earth and most decided to become superheroes or supervillains, but some remained somewhat in the middle. Pyro—Roland—crash lands (figuratively) into Vanessa's PR firm, realizing he needs good PR to make this happen, and is instantly unimpressed by her and her debilitating social anxiety/shyness. Soon enough, Nessa and Roland realize they're being pulled together by forces they can't explain, and by the time they give into them, other outlandish things begin happening around them. Together, they have to fight against elements that could destroy them and the world as they know it.All Superheroes Need PR was so much fun! I adore Stephens' commitment to making fun, goofy, outlandish fiction for Black people with Black characters who are dynamic and adaptive and daring and vulnerable and soft and strong and so completely down bad for the person they're falling for. My favorite part of this book was Nessa's backstory, and how her childhood traumas led her to a life so full of love and protection that she was so completely deserving of. Her family was absolutely incredible, and I loved their dynamic and how they adapted to accept Roland into the fold in their own way, giving him a place to belong on Earth as well. The narration was incredible. No notes. I recommend the audiobook real bad.I cannot WAIT for book 2! Thank you to Brilliance Publishing | Brilliance Audio, Montlake, Elizabeth Stephens, and NetGalley for providing me with an eARC, physical ARC, and ALC!5 fantastical ⭐️s3 🌶️"
Not Till We Are Lost,"Dennis E. Taylor, Ray Porter (Narrator)",4.31,"I was happy to find myself back in the Bobiverse, but overall this instalment felt a bit underwhelming. Feels like a bridge to the next big thing (if there is book 6 in the works).","So much fun! Please Sir, can we have some more?","Fifth installment in the Bobiverse— better than previous installment (“heavens river”) and well worth the wait! this book gets back to the zaney adventures of the multiple iterations of the bobs. Despite the temporary grounding of the bobs stories in heaven’s river we are back in space! This one involves the invention of real AI that may or may not accidentally have escaped but it least it least to technology that might be able to create black holes as means of travel…. Its always fun to see what is next for the Bobs…If you are already looking this far in the series, it wont disappoint… if you arent PLEASE try out the first one “we are legion we are bob” it is funny but has its serious moments. For me this is a go-to series especially with Ray Porter narrating… high high recommend!"

𝓜𝔂 𝓡𝓪𝓶𝓫𝓵𝓲𝓷𝓰/𝓖𝓲𝓰𝓰𝓵𝓲𝓷𝓰:So when I started this book, I was super confused for a while. That is until I checked the title and realized it was the ARC I’ve been putting off… Me while reading:- It’s “sweet PEA” not “sweet pee” ✋🏻😭- Now they have super cool eyes?? Someone give me some fan art! Ears and eyes. Pronto. - Aww he’s just a secret teddy bear - AHHHH!!! 💗💗- Cucumber = Cucumboner 👍🏻- He’s so cute I’m going to die. - eekkk he smiled!!- I love Killian - Stop don’t be sad you’re making me sad too 😢- Yay they had a real conversation!! 🥳🎉- UH OH- Cock Tail: 3 Human Girls: 0- Again with the pronunciation of clit?!- AND NIP-HOLES NOW??!! 🤦‍♀️- Ugh I just love pathetic men that beg - Awwee they’re so cute 🥹- THEY WERE MAGNOLIAS?! WHAAAAT- Wait that’s it???I love Magnolia and Garrek and how they made a little family with Killian too. I just wish (like all the other books) we got to see more.

And yet I had dozens, hundreds of them lined up and waiting for her.I needed her happiness the way I needed air “I heard your voice. I ran.”- it’s giving “You came. You called.” 🤭“I love you Magnolia,” he rasped against my mouth. “I have since that first night I met you.”“Why, Garrek,” I murmured, happiness warming every inch of me, “Are you asking me to marry you?” “Asking. Pleading. I’ll beg you if I have to,” he groaned. “Get down on my knees and… Wait. I am already on my knees.”A girl had to seize the moment… And the alien dick.- you know that’s right 💅🏻.・。.・゜✭・.・✫・゜・。.𝓹𝓻𝓮-𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓭:November 30th?? I have to wait till November?!!! 😖😭","This newest addition to the precious alien cowboy series should probably not be read as a standalone. The book hits the ground running following the events at the end of book 2 with Garrek (H) and his ward, Killian, escorting Magnolia (h) to her groom-to-be. Some casual mentions of previous world-building and prior characters’ names assume the reader would have a sense of the series already I think. Even though I’ve read all the books, the start felt a little off for me because of that dropped-right-back-in feeling. But damn did the characters and their beautiful relationship development make up for it as we went along. This is now my favorite of the series and it even squeezed some tears out of me too. Thank you to Lana for the super fun buddy read! She knew it was going to be one of the best of the series before I did too. Written in first person, dual POV. No ow drama, om drama in the sense that h is technically engaged to H’s cousin. H is inexperienced and h appeared to have some experience but not talked about.So Garrek comes across as a grump, but he’s really a caring and wonderful guy, just hasn’t had any softness in his life before. He’d do anything for those he cares about and he puts others before himself. He's also fighting big feelings as their journey continues because of the temptation of Magnolia. Killian, poor kid, has also experienced no softness and he takes an immediate shine to Magnolia. I adored the humor and specialness a young alien character added to this dynamic. Part of the beauty of the development that happens includes Killian and Garrek’s connection. Magnolia traveling with them brings a whole new world to them with her compassion, softness, and sweetness. Loved the background that Magnolia had and the depth it gave to her character as well. The slow build of Magnolia and Garrek falling into longing and the complicated feelings over it since she technically belongs to Garrek’s cousin, Oaken, whew. Once again, the depth of the emotions deserve so much shout out and will hit you hard, not just between the love interests, but also because of Killian. There are also a couple of intense scenes involving survival on this alien planet that’ll get your blood pumping. The wonderful bits of humor are still present however so you'll laugh just as often as you might need to rub an ache away from your chest.As for another reason for blood pumping *nudge nudge*, naturally the burn is slow for physical intimacy as well given their situation. Never fear, we get the glorious misnomers and then the infamous cocktail still lol. Not a lot of steam, there are two scenes (plus an earlier self pleasuring one), but it's still well-written and exactly right for them. The ending is super sweet and lovely and that HEA brightness of their wedding with everyone they care about involved in a way. Because Oaken still needs assistance, they don't get to be settled back to their own homestead area for a bit, but there's still a settled in feeling alongside the general happiness of two characters in love cementing that love. Plus Oaken adds a last touch of extra sweetness and alien misunderstanding. I cannot wait for the next books in this series and I may cry when we reach the end because Ursa Dax should write in this world forever.",My favorite of the series so far!!! My only complaint I NEED MORE!!!
Dune,Frank Herbert,4.28,"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.","Omg! I found a Folio Society Edition a bit cheaper and brand new! You can see all of the art online but look at this cover! Now I have this and Little Women I actually got from their site. I need to get more as I can 😬✅Reread 2022 to try to complete series! (I need to get the awesome audio too) 4.5 Stars LOOK DAMN IT! OMG!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾••••••••••••••••I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Anyhoo, I really loved the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾✅Thank you for the answers in my comments! 😊MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List","Dune.No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.Brilliant.***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. *** 2025 reread - This has lost nothing over the years and if nothing else, is even more potent now.I love that a new generation of fans, inspired by a very good adaptation are discovering Herbert's greatest work and for good reason, this is not only great science fiction, but good literature. Frank Herbert's prose is gifted and I am again amazed at the intricacy of his world building. There is foreshadowing within foreshadowing and his vision is something to behold."
Ender’s Game,Orson Scott Card,4.31,"DNF at 52%Dear Orson Scott Card,There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.Sincerely, Women. Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you. Sincerely, Kat. First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;""All the boys are organized into armies.""""All boys?""""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?  2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. Plot Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" Sure. Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. It--just--ugh. It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.","[I have a new website where I review awesome books & more! http://unlearner.com]I wanted to like Ender's Game. I really did. It's a wonder that even after more than halfway into the book, I still clung on to the foolishly optimistic notion that the book would somehow redeem itself. That it would end up justifying the tedious, repetitive, drearily dull chapters I trundled through over the course of several days (which is unusual, since I'm generally a fast reader).It pains me to say it, as a hardcore fangirl of science fiction, that one of sci-fi's most beloved and highly regarded novels did not do it for me. Actually, that is understating it. While I'm at it, I'll just duck and blurt it out: I loathed Ender's Game. Deep breaths. Let that sink in. Let the hate flow through you. Good, strike me down...I am unarmed. Okay. Now let's get to it.Was it because the expectations I had in my mind were unreasonably high and thus were responsible for ruining the book for me? No way. I make no bones about the fact that Ender's Game, regardless of the respect and popularity it commands in sci-fi circles, is an inherently bad novel. Why, though, you might ask. Why such vitriol for the book? Here you are, then. 1) Bad plotting: It didn't take me long to realise that after I was past Ender's arrival at the Battle School, every - literally every chapter thereon until his return to Earth - was more or less the same thing. Battle games, beating the shit out of kids, battle games, switching back and forth to Armies, battle games. It was so repetitive that I was exhausted at the end of every.single.chapter. Page after page after page of six year old, seven year old, eight year old Ender and his buddies zooming about in ships trying to freeze one another's socks off. Wheeee!2) Lack of characterisation: There are no personalities. There are no motivations. You never learn anything about the characters except that they are the good guys or the bad guys. Ender is brilliant at everything. He NEVER loses. Not once. Bernard, Stilson and Co. are the bad guys. They're evil baddies cause dey r jealuz of ender's brilliance omg!!! That's it. No background, no depth, no internal conflicts. No motivation. Words cannot express how two-dimensional and woefully lacking in personality the characters are.3) Demosthenes and Locke. What the heck was that all about? I appreciate Card's prescience about the 'Nets' and blogging before it was around, but come on, this is pushing it a bit too far. How, I beg you, how are we supposed to take the idea that a pair of kids end up taking the world by posting in online forums and blogging? As if we people of the internet didn't have enough delusions of grandeur already. ;)4) Now, this really gets my goat:I had to wait for the last 20 pages to get information that was of any worth to the story at all. I'm talking about Mazer's Rackham explaning the buggger's communications system to Ender. As for the 'twist ending': I honestly, and I mean, honestly did not find that riveting. It was predictable and, worse, did not justify all that I had to read to make my way to the end.  5)Also: It was hard to feel for Ender. I say this as a high-school nerd in my own day, as the reviled and hated and made-fun-of socially awkward kid who wanted to be good at whatever they did. But that doesn't make me any more sympathetic to Ender. Honestly, I fail to see what's so great about Ender anyway. I am so infuriated at Card for this. Apart from Ender's claim to intelligence (which is never completely explained, by the way) there is nothing, NOTHING, that is worth justifying him as the protagonist of one of scifi's supposedly best books ever. Yes, he loves his sister Valentine. Yes, he doesn't want to hurt people. Yes, he goes ahead and does it anyway. Again and again. (Ending up murdering two school boys in the process. Uhm, major wtf there.)I am rarely so caustic about the books I read, but this time I feel I am justified in doing so. I had such hopes for this book. Not impossibly high or anything. At the very least, I had expected to like it, you know? I remember, as I worked my way past chapters 4,5,7,10,14...I expected it to get better. I expected myself to be mistaken at the initial dissatisfaction, then incredulity, then mild annoyance and then a string of sad sighs and resignation to dislike. Alas, I wasn't mistaken. I felt betrayed. I thought this book was right up there with those 'kindred ones', you know? The sort of books you can come back to again and again. Instead, what I got was a bad plotline, progressively unrealistic plot developments, and a cast of flat, lifeless, unpleasant characters to boot. Ender's Game, how I wish I had loved you. Why did you forsake me thus.","I read this story decades back with no special expectations. Like most books I read it just happened to be lying around the house. I read it, was hugely entertained, and went on to read three or four of the sequels.I've heard since all manner of 'stuff' about the author but what's true and what isn't I don't know and I'm not here to critique the man behind the keyboard. All I can do is report on the contents of the book and those I can thoroughly recommend you check out.The main character, Ender Wiggin, through whose eyes we see the story unfold, is a child genius. If you're one of those people who wants your protagonist to be an average member of society, typical of his/her age and gender... step away. Ender's story is told because he is very far from ordinary. OSC employs a bunch of fairly standard story-telling tricks. Our hero is underestimated at every turn, he exceeds expectations, we know he's got it in him and we're frustrated by the stoopid people who just won't see it. There's a bully/nemesis and nobody else but us sees just how nasty he is... However, OSC manages to bake an irresistible cake using those standard ingredients and once he starts sprinkling on originality as well, you've just got to eat it all.This is sci-fi, not hard sci-fi, not soft sci-fi... let's say 'chewy'. It has a slightly old school EE Doc Smith feel to it, and you expect someone to pull out a monkey-wrench whenever the computer starts smoking, but none of that worried me. Given the date it was written there's some quite prescient stuff about the internet here, although shall we say ... optimistic ... about the ends to which it's put. Card foresaw rather more reasoned political/philosophical debate that swayed public opinion more effectively than rhetoric and demagoguery. And rather less hard core porn. Additionally the inclusion of female and Muslim characters whilst not front and centre was fairly progressive for 1985 (not ground breaking but certainly ahead of the curve).This is actually a book with good messages (for the time) about equality, and one which poses interesting philosophical questions about what happens when races with orthogonal thought processes come into contact, and how far one can or should go in such situations.There definitely is some characterisation going on. We're not talking Asimov's Foundation here where brilliant ideas invite you to forgive cardboard characters. The people here are decently drawn and Ender has his own angst (involving genius psychopathic siblings) that is quite engaging. However, it's the stuff that goes on that drives the story. The war games in preparation for battling the aliens, the unfortunately named 'Buggers'. These war games and Ender's brilliance in overcoming increasingly dire odds are a major theme and I loved them.And then there's the twist. I'll say no more on that except that I was too engaged with the story to see it coming, and when it hit me ... well, I'd give the book 6* just for that moment. It doesn't work for everyone but it did for me!EDIT: I have now seen the film - which I enjoyed. The film skips a lot that's important to the book, but I found it entertaining.EDIT 2: Orson Scott Card reviewed *my* first trilogy. That's pretty damn cool!(scroll down the article)http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/ev... Join my Patreon Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..."
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,Douglas Adams,4.22,"In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.","The universe is a joke. Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.It's just is a joke, but some of us are in on it.","I am not one of those who think this is the best book ever written. It does not affect me on any deep emotional level and this kind of quirky sci-fi comedy is just not really my thing. However, that being said, Adams' has some of the best quotes EVER (not all of these are from this exact book):""In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" ""For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.""""The Guide says there is an art to flying"", said Ford, ""or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.""""A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."" ""Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?"" ""The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."""
The Martian,Andy Weir,4.42,"I’m pretty much fucked.
Ok, show of hands. How many of you have uttered these exact words? (or words to that effect). Not everyone? I see we have some liars out there. How many have said them at least twice? Three times? Four? Those with hands still up, you probably need to make some adjustments to your approach, find a safer line of work, hobbies that do not entail long drops, stop trying the weekly specials at McBlowfish, or seek out people to date who are into less extreme…um…sports. These are the opening words of The Martian. Astronaut Mark Watney is definitely more screwed than most of us have ever been. Dude missed his ride and there will not be another along for, oh, four years. Supplies on hand were only meant to cover a few weeks, maybe months. And that Martian atmosphere is definitely no fun, lacking stuff like, oh, breathable air, and a reasonable range of temperature. It does, offer, however, extremely harsh (good for scouring that burned on gunk from sauce pans) and long-lasting (as in months) dust storms. And if that was not enough he faces an array of other challenges. unfriendly locals No, Kibby (the 12-year-old kibitzer who infects my brain), no Mars Attacks brain beasts, or that other guy, even though I know he is your favorite. Real challenges. For example, the music he has for his stay consists of disco. The viewing options include 70s TV. Most of us might give serious consideration to minimizing the guaranteed pain, frustration, starvation and inevitable death by, maybe, taking a short hustle outside sans that special suit. It would be a very, very short last dance. Watney is either a cock-eyed optimist or an idiot. I'm going with the former, as he is indeed made of the right stuff. He is armored and well supplied with the sort of can-do designer genes that might make the rest of us feel like the can’t-do sorts we are. He is the poster boy for positive attitude. It does not hurt that he is way smart, with expertise in a wide-enough range of things scientific to matter. It does not hurt that he is an engineer who gets off on taking apart, putting back-together, figuring out, thinking through, testing, trying, and pushing envelopes. But his crew is headed home, and what hope is there, really?The Martian tells of Watney’s attempt to survive in a literally alien environment, using only the tools on hand and his wits. It is a gripping story with one of the most adorable heroes you are likely to encounter, on this planet or any other. (No, Kibby, not a kitten) How could you not root for a guy who scrapes through Thanksgiving dinner for potato parts to plant for food? Of course, one might think “been there, done that,” particularly as 1964’s  Robin Crusoe on Mars  offered a retelling of Daniel Defoe’s classic tale in a more contemporary notion of a remote locale. A 1905 novel used a different classic traveler in the same sort of format. Of course those tellings had a lot more in common with the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs as seen by Frank Frazetta than they do with the vision we have of the Red Planet today, or, say, reality. RealityOr is it?One of these was a shot of you know where. The other was taken at Death Valley, which was used, BTW, in the filming of Robinson Crusoe on MarsMost of the tale is spent on Watney’s very compelling attempt to survive, going through all the challenges he faces trying to make air, preserve and maybe generate water, make his food last, get some sort of communication set up, deal with things like exploding air-locks, biblical level dust-storms, toppling ground-transport vehicles, you know, stuff, most of it life-threatening. The other end of things is how the folks on the ground deal with this GInornous OOPS. There are technical elements, of course but more interesting, for me, were the political considerations. To tell the crew or not? Imagine how bummed out, embarrassed, and guilty you might be on that ship (the Hermes) returning home, knowing you had left one behind. Might it affect your ability to take care of necessary business for the next bunch of months? Another question is whether to tell the public, and if so, when. How about getting help from other space-capable nations? Are any international dealings simple? There is also some in-house (NASA) staff maneuvering that is wonderful to see.Andy WeirIn her fabulous book on writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes
Having a likeable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud…
Probably the greatest strength of The Martian is the narration of Mark Watney. He is engaging and funny, optimistic and capable. I suppose there are some who might find him lacking in sharp edges, but I thought he worked great. Matt Damon as Mark Watney, enjoying the view  – from the film. The new earth-based shooting location was Wadi Rum, Jordan. I am sure they did plenty of color adjustments in post, but boy-o-boy does this place look like an alien landscape. GripesYes, really, there is too much scientific detail. It is not that it is beyond the comprehension of a lot of readers (although it will skip by a fair number) it is the share of time, the number of pages, the sheer volume of obstacles to be overcome, and the very detailed explanation of so many of them that tilts the book a bit too much towards the MacGyver demo. Weir writes very well about the other elements of the story. Repetition of DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, with the subsequent amazingly clever repair du jour, does get a bit old after a while. I had to fight an urge to scan at times. But that is really it. Otherwise, The Martian is an absolute delight to read. Watney is lovable as well as capable, and makes excellent use of his sense of humor to look on the bright side of life, in a very dark circumstance. Whether he makes it out on time or not (not gonna spoil that one) you will cheer him on, hope for the best, and fly past those pages with considerable, if maybe not interplanetary, speed. Is there life on Mars? There will be while you read this book.

“I can't wait till I have grandchildren. “When I was younger, I had to walk to the rim of a crater. Uphill! In an EVA suit! On Mars, ya little shit! Ya hear me? Mars!”
A book that makes me willingly turn my chronically sleep-deprived state into the acutely sleep-deprived one as I battle somnolence at 4 a.m. so that I can read just *one more* chapter (we all know how that one chapter somehow turns into a dozen as the sunrise starts lurking outside the window).A book with the sense of humor that is a perfect match for my own (the one that occasionally causes some serious eyebrow-raising from my colleagues).Meet The Martian by Andy Weir. The book I want to marry and have dorky wisecracking grandchildren with.
“So that’s the situation. I’m stranded on Mars. I have no way to communicate with Hermes or Earth. Everyone thinks I’m dead. I’m in a Hab designed to last 31 days.If the Oxygenator breaks down, I’ll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I’ll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I’ll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I’ll eventually run out of food and starve to death.So yeah. I’m fucked.”



Mark Watney is an astronaut who is an engineer AND a botanist. He was the 17th human to set foot on Mars, and the first human to be abandoned there after being mistaken for dead. There's no way in hell he has enough supplies to last until a dubious chance of rescue (if NASA even figures out that he in fact is very much not dead). In a situation like this, I'd crap my pants and become breathing-challenged. 
“Mars keeps trying to kill me.Well... Mars didn't electrocute Pathfinder. So I'll amend that:Mars and my stupidity keep trying to kill me.”
Mark, however, embarks on the determined survivalist adventure unrivaled since the time of Robinson Crusoe (and lacking the blatant and now painful colonialism of Defoe's protagonist). Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids, sure - but it may be just the kind of place to raise a few potatoes and fix up a few Mars rovers.
“I told NASA what I did. Our (paraphrased) conversation was:Me: “I took it apart, found the problem, and fixed it.”NASA: “Dick.”



Faced with a disaster after disaster, he beats all the odds and finds ways to survive in a true MacGyver way, using his brains (stuffed with all kinds of science, of course) and a few cosmic supplies. And duct tape. Can't forget the duct tape.
“Also, I have duct tape. Ordinary duct tape, like you buy at a hardware store. Turns out even NASA can’t improve on duct tape.”“Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.”
MacGyverism is great, yeah. But what makes this book my literary soulmate and more addicting for me than a bag of crack laced with meth and sprinkled with chocolate (or whatever the drugs of choice may be now) is Mark Watney's near constant wisecracking that is EXACTLY the humor I *get* and I (sadly, perhaps) inflict on others.[NASA guy on Earth]: “What must it be like?” He pondered. “He’s stuck out there. He thinks he’s totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man’s psychology?”He turned back to Venkat. “I wonder what he’s thinking right now.” [MARK'S JOURNAL ON MARS]: LOG ENTRY: SOL 61 How come Aquaman can control whales? They’re mammals! Makes no sense.”
Ah, the sheer awesomeness of dorky humor peppered with bits of science that probably would work if used by someone who, unlike me, was a bit more experimentally-engineering inclined. Ah, the silly lowbrow puns that never fail to make me chuckle. Ah, the deadpan humor that never gets old. Ah, the beauty of never taking yourself too seriously. Mark Watney, you are my literary soulmate.
”I tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks. This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for.”“Ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Mars Vampires. I’ll have to risk it.”“They say no plan survives first contact with implementation. I’d have to agree.”
No wonder Mark Watney can call himself the King of Mars. And even better:
“Here's the cool part: I will eventually go to Schiaparelli crater and commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard Ares 4 and operating the comm system. After I board Ares 4, before talking to NASA, I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission.That makes me a pirate!A Space Pirate!”
So yeah, this book struck a perfect chord with me. It seemed to have somehow been written just for me, since of course I'm clearly the most important thing since sliced bread, or however that saying goes. All I know is that a book I read twice in three days is perfect for me. 5 stars.
“Yeah. This all sounds like a great idea with no chance of catastrophic failure.That was sarcasm, by the way.”
—————2021: I still love every page of it.","A celebration of scientific ingenuity and man's unfailing spirit to survive, The Martian left me astounded and exhilarated. It made me laugh, think, and hope, and along the way, it captured my imagination and my heart.Due to a freak accident, astronaut Mark Watney is in a bit of a jam. His crewmates have blasted off from Mars and left him behind, thinking he is dead. Now he has no way to contact anyone and his supplies are fast dwindling. To survive, he must reach into the depths of his scientific knowledge and creativity and good humor, and put all that to good use if he is to make it off the planet alive.I'm like the very last person to read this book, and I honestly have no idea why I waited so long. Maybe I thought since I've seen the movie already (like a dozen times!), that I wouldn't be surprised by the book. Or maybe I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my sky-high expectations. But I'm so glad I finally stopped procrastinating and read it. Because this story could not be more made for me if it tried.Right from the first page, it was utterly riveting and unputdownable. It felt so real that it seemed like I was actually reading the mission logs of an astronaut. I kept forgetting that we hadn't really sent a man to Mars yet and that this is just a story.The science in here is a large part of what made it feel so authentic and fascinating. It's based on real science, not the handwavy stuff that a lot of sci-fi books resort to. But you don't have to understand every single thing in order to follow and enjoy the story. In fact, there were a few times I just move on when I wasn't 100% clear on a technical detail, and it didn't take anything away. It helped that I had watched the movie before reading the book, so it was much easier to visualize what was going on.Usually when you think of disaster stories and fights for survival, it ends up being a dark and brooding read. But that's not this book at all. I loved its optimism and humor and charm. It was lighthearted and fun even though it was tackling some serious problems. It not only showcased what one person's perseverance can accomplish, but also what the world can do if it came together. It made me feel happy and inspired to immerse myself in this imaginary and cooperative world, if only for a few hours.This story isn't perfect. You can tell it's Weir's first book, and so it does have a few quirks. At times, the humor is a bit too potty-mouthed and the technical and scientific information can be a bit too enthusiastically detailed. But I found the overall story so amazing that these small flaws are easily overlooked.This is my favorite type of book. I love reading about space exploration and science, courage and hard work, and overcoming great odds to achieve the impossible, all with a sense of humor.

Ready Player One,Ernest Cline,4.23,"I originally gave this book 3 stars as harmless lightweight fun, but my opinion of it declined as time went by. Then after reading Armada I fully realized what a talentless one-trick hack that Cline really is so I changed this rating. Plus, his outraged hardcore fans kept coming on here and telling me that I missed the point since I didn't give it 5 stars so I might as well give them something to really be mad about. If you're one of those Cline fans who wants to whine about it in the comments I will just delete it and block you.Adventures in Time MowingAfter my laptop fused to my lawn mower due to a freak lightning strike, I discovered that I could use it to travel through time.“Wow, where’d you come from?”“I’m from 2011. Got a time mower and decided to come to the future. I’ll spare you the full origin story. My name’s Kemper.”“I’m Wade Watts. Welcome to 2044.”“Thanks. I gotta say, things are looking kind of grim around here. Are those mobile homes stacked up like hillbilly skyscrapers?”“Yeah, I live in one of them. We’ve had a lot of problems once the cheap fossil fuels started running out. Life kinda sucks ass these days. Fortunately, we’ve got the OASIS.”“What’s that?”“It’s this virtual reality that’s kind of a combination of the Internet and the biggest MMORPG ever made. Here put this on, and I’ll show you.”“Hey, this is pretty sweet, Wade. But what’s with all this old stuff here in your virtual room. It looks like the ‘80s vomited in here.”“Oh, it’s part of my research for the contest. See the guy who invented the OASIS was this old nerd named James Halliday. He left an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS and whoever finds it wins the prize. He was totally obsessed with the ‘80s and nerdly stuff like computers, sci-fi, cartoons, movies, comics and video games. He left three keys to three gates hidden in here, and the clues have to be stuff that he loved. So a lot of people like me have to know all about the '80s to hunt for the egg.""“How long has this been going on?”“For years now. Nobody has found the first key yet.”“And you what? Watch movies from the ‘80s? Listen to the music? Read his favorite books? Play old video games?”“It‘s even bigger than that. Because of the contest, the entire world is obsessed with the ‘80s. The clothes and hairstyles are considered cool again.”“Really? Well, I gotta get the hell out of here then. Thanks for showing me this, Wade. How do I log out?”“You’re leaving already? Don’t you want to…Oh, my god! You said you were from 2011? And you’re in your 40s, right?”“Well, just barely…”“So you actually lived through the ‘80s?”“Afraid so. High school class of 1988.”“That’s awesome! You gotta tell me all about it, Kemper.”“Kid, why would you want to hear about that? You’re sitting here with enough computer power to download everything from the collected works of Shakespeare to the entire run of The Wire and you want to hear about the ’80s? Just for a contest?”“I love the ’80s. It was the coolest time ever!”“Uh, not really. In fact, I think the ’90s beat the shit out of them. That not worrying about the Cold War thing was a relief and the music was a lot better. Plus we got to wear flannel. That was fun.”“But… you got to play the old video games in the actual arcades, and you saw the first generation of home computers come out. Plus, music videos and John Hughes movies and Rubik’s Cubes and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album and….”“Yeah, Wade. I lived through it all. I remember when MTV played music videos and when Eddie Murphy was funny. But you’re making me sad, kid.”“Why?”“Lemme tell you a story, Wade. About ten years after I got out of high school, an old buddy I had stayed in touch with had a birthday bash and invited a bunch of us that used to run around together. So we’re at his house drinking and playing cards just like the old days and catching up and playing ‘Remember when?”. It was a lot of fun, but we’d been listening to hair metal and classic rock all night, and at one point, I was flipping through the CD’s.”“Actual CD’s! Not downloads?”“Hell, I’m so old even my post-high school stories are dated now. Yes, Wade, real CD’s. Anyhow, I found a new Foo Fighters album, and I put it in. And this one guy made a face and asked me why I had taken the Guns-n-Roses out. And I said something like the nostalgia had been fun but I needed something from that decade. Being completely serious he said that he didn’t know how I could listen to that stuff, and that he still listened to the same exact music we did in high school. He had just replaced his old cassettes with CD’s. The guy had completely managed to miss grunge and was perfectly happy with the same play list in 1998 that he’d been listening to in 1988. And that was one of the saddest things I ever heard, Wade.”“But maybe he just really liked that stuff.”“I liked it too, once upon a time. And I can still belt out a pretty good version of Relax when Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on the radio, but it was a certain time and place. Now it’s done. I find it depressing that someone of Gen X would want to be stuck there and never moved on to anything new. But it got worse after that, Wade. Because we got older and then the media started catering to us by going for nostalgia trips on everything from trying to remake the Knight Rider TV show to shitty movies like The Transformers and G.I. Joe to the goddamn Smurfs. I’m tired of it in 2011, Wade. I don’t want a new Indiana Jones movie, I want the NEXT Indiana Jones. But no one is working on that because all of us got obsessed with regurgitating our childhoods over and over.”“That is kind of sad, Kemper.”“What’s even sadder is seeing it happen to a generation that didn’t even live through it. When I was a teenager, I got sick to death of baby boomer nostalgia and there’d be these kids my age who tried to be like damn dirty hippies by wearing tie-dye shirts and going to listen to Grateful Dead tribute bands. They were nostalgic for an era that wasn’t even theirs, and I always thought it was a waste. Don’t be like that, Wade. You seem like a nice kid. Don’t sit here watching Family Ties reruns and playing Space Invaders and making jokes about Ewoks. That was then. This is now. It’s your time and you should be out there trying to find the stuff that will become part of your own memories of growing up, not rehashing ours.”“Gee, Kemper. That’s a really good point. You’ve opened my eyes. Thanks a lot.”“You’re welcome, Wade. By the way, what the hell was this prize that was so good that it got the entire world doing the safety dance again?”“Oh, the winner gets the controlling interest in Halliday’s company and his personal fortune which is about $240 billion dollars.”“Did you say $240 billion? Dollars?”“Yes, so how about we log off. Maybe I’ll take a walk and see if I can find this girl I like. I’ve been…”“Screw that. Fire this rig up, Wade. Put on some Def Leppard and find me a pair of acid washed jeans and some high top Reeboks. Let’s start looking for clues. For $240 billion I’ll live through the ‘80s again.”**************************************************I didn’t actually hate this book. It did a lot of very clever stuff regarding an entire virtual universe. And for a member of Gen X, it was a fast and fun romp down memory lane. It was kind of like Snow Crash meets the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie.But I’ve got a personal pet peeve against people trying to live in the past and since this book is nostalgia porn*, the basic premise did rub me the wrong way. The idea that the kids of the 2040s are just watching episodes of ‘80s TV shows and playing Donkey Kong really kind of depressed me. *I stole that phrase from Flannery’s review. Sorry, Flannery! It was just too good.I might have been able to get past it a little easier if at least one of the kids said something like, “Jesus, I hate this ‘80s bullshit. I can’t wait until his freakin’ contest is over so I can live in the here and now.” But instead all of them treat it like it’s the greatest entertainment ever. So even though a few post ’80s things like Firefly or the Lord of the Rings movies get mentioned, we’re supposed to believe that nerd pop culture reached a zenith in the ’80s and nothing worth geek obsession happened between 1990 and 2040? Sorry, but that seems kind of unlikely and the kind of wishful thinking that an aging Gen Xer would write as he pines for his glory days.","WARNING: UNPOPULAR OPINION BECAUSE I DIDN'T FUCKING LIKE READY PLAYER ONEanyone I saw writing a negative review for this got like, abused in their comments BUT. Im going for it anywayunmarked spoilers ahead. ft, appearances from the voices of adele and beyonce sum up Ready Player One in a single word? wankyreplace with: that 400 page book which used 80s references to condescend people not invested in that culture was incomparably wankyokay, I'm going to start with the good stuff• the worldbuilding around the OASIS, and the setting was really good. I thought that the way that OASIS was built, described and functioned within this world was very well thought out and clever. It was definitely something high-tech enough to be interesting, but also realistic enough to be plausible. The setting in 2044 and the way the Earth/living standards are set up are well thought out. • The other tech industry was a good ""villain"" in that I thought their motivations were plausible, and the interaction between them and the OASIS made sense. The gamers motivations to prevent the Sixers from winning and ruining OASIS were believable and the worldbuilding was intertwined with the motivations of characters which I liked• It was reasonably fast paced • OG. WHAT A GUY.. HIS NAME IS FUCKING OG THE GREAT AND POWERFUL IM LAUGHINOKAY. AND NOW I GET SALTYFirst things first, back to my point about it being wanky. I KNEW I was coming into this book to get lots of 80s references, I was fine with that, I was excited for it. I wanted the nostalgic feel of Stranger Things, because thats what people told me I'd get. I wanted that homage.   • things I didn't get: that What I got instead was a ""gate keeping"" attitude in which any person/character who didn't have enough knowledge of the 80's was deemed not smart enough and not cool enough. The overabundance of 80s references reached the point of insanity. I can't get over this bit when Art3mis orders some drink and Wade is like 'OH SHE'S GETTING THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME AS *CHARACTER* DRINKS. SO COOL. SHE'S WORTHY'The 80's references were so oversaturated I couldn't actually separate them from their characters. Like, these characters literally WERE 80's references. the whole time, it just felt like the author was leaning over me like ""yeah, yeah, i know so many references. mhhm, another one, another one. YOU THINK I don't have more ?! HAHA, fooled. Have another, have ten more. I know everything there is to know about the 80's, don't test me kid. you don't know explicit detail of every spider-man comic ever released, FAKE FAN FAKE FAN.' Anyway, it was really fucking annoying. It should have been a nice throwback to the 80's, not a fucking wank fest in which everyone loses their fucking mind and can't keep it together over pac-man. But seriously, the condescending tone about people who don't LIVE THE EIGHTIES annoyed me so fucking much. 

Right, next up: characters. Wade was ........ so fucking annoying. First of all, his attitude sucked. But that aside, his charactersation was just not good. His knowledge of the 80's was just unbelievable. He mentions at least a dozen shows that he's watched a dozen or so times, now, I'm struggling to believe he actually had time to watch the amount of shit he has, that many times. His knowledge was all-consuming and it was just unrealistic. He has literally no flaws. his main flaw ? he's overweight and a geek boy who can't get girls. Well do not worry. Welcome to Wade's Biggest Loser Story:
""I spent 4 weeks doing pushups in the morning and now I look like an Abercrombie model :)""
You're a geek boy? well don't worry, you're superior to all those other boys anyway ! You're a nice boy !!!!!! and anyway, *beyonce voice* who run the world ? geeks geeks. Wade owns 5 fedoras. JFGHFJG HE JUS ANNOYED ME SO MUCH ALWAYS BITCHING ABOUT HOW GIRLS FIND HIM WEIRD WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T LIKE, STALK THEM, FAM. Wade honestly felt like such a self insert/wish fulfilment type character. He annoyed me so fucking much, he was just rude and weird, and his obsession with Art3mis wasn't healthy. His obsession with Hallidays and OASIS genuinely wasn't healthy. The female characters were so ghdh WE DESERVE BETTER. Art3mis had potential to be a great character, but she was ultimately reduced to a love interest. She tried to separate from Wade to focus on the Easter Egg but then he stalks her and she ends up with him ??? Also, I found it annoying we were supposed to give Wade Nice Boy Points for thinking her ""curvy"" avatar was hot, when we ALL KNOW it was the KimK type curvy and SHE LITERALLY IS TINY THIN IRL ANYWAY Aech is so ?? *adele voice* WE COULD OF HAD IT ALL. Representation, is NOT real when it's a twist. It's so disappointing Aech was a black, female, lesbian and we didn't get to see that AT ALL. We get 1 chapter before she goes back to being a 'male' in the OASIS. Urgh, it's just annoying. I know Ernest Cline was trying to do a ""oh look, you treated this person a certain way thinking they were white/male/straight now treat them the same when u know they're black/female/gay BUT IT WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN WAY BETTER IF WADES BEST FRIEND WAS REPRESENTED AS A GAY BLACK GIRL. You can't even say this is a diverse book because thats a ""spoiler"" urrhtgtjhgkjalso fml because Kira is also the reason Og and Halliday stopped being friends like why do they only exist for male relationships & angst urghThe main evil guy in the evil corporation who's name I can't remember was so plain? He was such a stock villain and he just ??? died ???Deus ex Machina• Can't pass a level? Don't worry, I will magically whip some obscure knowledge out my ass to save the day• Party got crushed by a sinister army? lucky some guy at this party happens to be able to fight them with unbelievable, rule-defying levels of power• don't have somewhere to stay? NO WORRIES, a random billionaire is gonna show up in a space thats supposed to be barred to all characters to offer you sanctuary? ""didn't the rules of this universe establish this was a private chat room"""" yeah, they did. but turns out there's this other rule where thats not true SURPRISE• Died? Well, no worries. Turns out you're the first person in history to get a FREE LIFEit annoyed me how convenient some plot points wereOTHER STUFF I JUST DIDN'T LIKE• There is a bit when a character calls paraplegic people ""repulsive""• YOU CAN'T GO FROM OBESE TO MUSCULAR IN 8 WEEKS FROM DOING 20 MINUTE EXERCISES ACTUALLY FUCK OFF IDK WHY THIS ANNOYED ME SO MUCH BUT IT DID• the fact he's called Wade like Wade Wilson it says alot tbh• stalking stalking stalking• the fact I had to read an entire chapter of Wade talking about the sex he had with a doll and masturbating and how it's like ""THE COOLEST BOY THING EVER""• TOO MUCH detail it felt like a slog. I was skimming entire pages of irrelevent detail about exactly what model of haptic suit Wade decided to buy that daySo yeah, overall I just didn't have a good time with this book it was just so obnoxious and annoying I couldn't get into it at all lmfao worst hype ever aaaaanddddd....","Back in 2011, Ready Player One was, perhaps, the year's most well-reviewed book. It received glowing commendations from the likes of NPR, The New York Times, Wired, John Scalzi, Patrick Rothfuss, and many, many more. It maintains a 4.3 average score on Goodreads.com (a significant accomplishment given its 20,000+ reviews), and you'd be hard pressed to find a negative review in any major publication.In no way can I make any sense of this. Please believe what I am about to write, as it is not even close to hyperbole:Ready Player One was the most disappointing reading experience of my entire life.It’s the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets.   And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of puzzles that will yield a massive fortune—and remarkable power—to whoever can unlock them.   For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday’s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved—that of the 1980s. And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt—among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize.And with that, you've just read the best that Ready Player One has to offer: its synopsis.I should preface the rest of this review by stating that I am, and have always been, a geek at heart. I am as much a byproduct of the 1980s as anyone. I've been a lifelong gamer, a pop culture obsessive, and I once thought I'd married, for real, Princess Peach.Ready Player One has been hailed by its author, Ernest Cline, as a love letter to anyone who ""grew up geek,"" a sentiment that has been confirmed by every review, in every publication, all over the world. And yet, the Ready Player One that I read was less a love letter to geeks than it was a pat on the back to an 18-year-old Cline, a Stephanie-Meyer-eclipsing Mary Sue that attempts to justify the behavior of an overweight, socially awkward, virginal nerd.I'm not being mean. It's literally what it is.At its core, Ready Player One is a fairy tale, a treasure hunt. Albeit, one designed by an 80s-obsessed ultra-nerd whose entire life was steeped in nostalgia. Evidently, human creativity peaked with Zork and Legend. So Wade's hunt for Halladay's ""easter egg"" is one long excuse for a constant—and I do mean constant—barrage of 80s references.Actually, scratch that. It's not so much referencing as it is name dropping. 95% of it serves no actual purpose aside from simply mentioning it. At first the references reinforce the story, helping to create a framework that grounds the reader in the ""world"" Cline has ""created"" with OASIS. But after the first chapter (yes, the first chapter) these devolve into ceaseless, meaningless throwbacks. The novelty lasts all of ten minutes until you realize that it's all just an annoying form of telling, not showing.If the point is to re-enact sections of D&D modules and 80s cult classics, then your readers are just getting third-hand retreads of things that aren't even important to begin with. It's sort of like when your socially-awkward friend resolutely recounts a super-sweet TV show for you, word for word, and all you can do is just sit there and wait until he's finished. Pay $20 for that experience and you get Ready Player One.What makes Ready Player One so disappointing is that these references seem to the be the sole purpose of Cline's writing. The novel doesn't say much of anything. Sure, there are a handful of introspective moments—limp attempts at social commentary—but they're of so little consequence they seem thrown in to fulfill some delusion of grandeur.Yes, reality really is better and more meaningful than virtual reality. We've been told this in almost every VR-based story known to man. And yet, that's Cline's one takeaway. (Oh, and you should love people for who they are on the inside, even if they have a birthmark on half their face. Thanks Ernest!)What's confusing about the 80s obsession, though, is the fact that Ready Player One is, at best, a YA-level read. Cline would sit very comfortably beside the likes of Rick Riordan and Suzanne Collins. Ready Player One is inelegant and shallow at the best of times, and yet, this novel is clearly targeted at the 30-year-old-and-up-crowd (if you're any younger much of the subject material is simply too obscure). This subject/reading-level conflict, then, makes the whole mess inherently problematic.And what's worst—no, I haven't even gotten to the worst part yet—is how the entire thing reeks of elitism. Yes, you read that correctly. This is a book about an overweight, unattractive, lazy, delusional, uber-geek elitist, who believes—truly believes—that his knowledge of 80s trivia makes him superior. And Cline basically affirms this! Some guys buy cars, others put socks down their pants, Cline writes 80s trivia novels.There is a scene, in chapter 3, in which Wade (or Parzival, as his handle goes), engages in a nerdy rat-a-tat-tat with another OASIS player to see who has more knowledge of 80s pop culture. It is the singularly most embarrassing thing I have ever read from a professional. It's just this much above fan fiction. Actually, fuck that. I've actually read fan fiction more entertaining than this. It was absolutely ridiculous.Add to all this the fact that Cline's characters are uniformly flat. Wade, our narrator, is blatant author wish fulfillment and his lessons are trivial, at best. His love interest is present only to represent Wade's ""true"" victory (her heart). The unknowable best friend who harbours a secret you'll never guess (meaning, you absolutely will). And the villain … a one-dimensional, nearly faceless corporation as uninteresting as a rival boyfriend in a John Hughes movie.""If it's a great book, I want to luxuriate in its greatness. And if it's crap, I want it to magically transform itself into genius. This book just stayed crap."" – Amy, a reviewer on Amazon.comReady Player One exists solely to glorify hollow pop culture from the 1980s, and yet, Ernest Cline does absolutely nothing to convince the reader that the 80s were cool if he/she didn't think so already. The plot is overly simplistic and plods along with inevitability, making The Da Vinci Code read like a Pulitzer Prize winner. Cline's hero, Wade, is the trivia-equivalent of Superman, where he is so overpowered his ""quest"" becomes tedious, rather than uplifting. And, at the end of the day, Wade is just an arrogant, elitist prick. (He describes his abject poverty and lack of real world opportunities as like ""being in the world's greatest video arcade with no quarters."" Seriously, fuck you, Wade.)Every time I think about this book I want to make my rating lower. It started as a 2, then dropped to a 1.5, and by the end of this review I feel I have no choice but to give it a 1. I hated this book with every fibre of my being, and it escapes the dreaded 0 only because Cline managed to form actual sentences.Never again will I read Ernest Cline. You can count on that."
Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,4.50,"2025: Four years later this book is just as good and just as much fun. Any book that still, despite knowing the plot, makes me smile on each page deserves to be among the absolute favorites.————————
 “I’d have to do the math to know for sure but — I can’t help it, I want to do the math right now.”
This book is half science experiments, half wacky buddy comedy — and it just works so so so well! That nerdy glee I felt on every page of The Martian is back full force. By golly*, I am so gosh-darn* happy right now. Geez and fudge and Holy Moly!*. (Yeah, this book’s protagonist tends to sound like he’s 85 — he’s just not a foul-mouthed sort of a scientist): * 

“The whole world put you in charge of solving this problem, and you came directly to a junior high school science teacher?”“Yes.”
In The Martian, Mark Watney woke up with an antenna sticking out of his chest and realized he had to science the shit out of it if he wanted to survive on Mars. In Project Hail Mary, Ryland Grace wakes up from a coma with a bunch of tubes sticking out of him (including that spot where the sun don’t shine) and realizes that he has no memory of what happened — and eventually, through a bit of complicated science, realizes and remembers that he’s the sole survivor of a mission that’s the last ditch chance to save Earth from a star-eating microbe (“Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion years.”). For life that needs the output of the Sun it’s not good news. And yes, he also will need to science the shit out of it.
“How did you do it? What killed it?”“I penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.”“You poked it with a stick?”“No!” I said. “Well. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.”
It’s obvious how wonderfully nerdy Andy Weir is. It’s obvious how happy random science stuff makes him — and that enthusiasm is infectious (not Astrophage-infectious but pretty darn close). As he says in this interview,“My favorite part of writing is the research, and the math, and the figuring all that stuff out.” 
“The largest nuclear reactor on Earth makes about eight gigawatts. It would take that reactor two million years to create that much energy.”  How can you not love a book that shows such resourcefulness and competence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds? Done with overexcited enthusiasm in the most endearing way, full of sarcastic self-deprecation and humor as coping mechanism, and teaching us science the same way as a very good junior high science teacher may explain concepts to a group of overexcitable preteens. And you betcha that Weir shows his work, and even those not well-versed in science should be able to get it as he really makes it very accessible and non-daunting.
“No, that’s not creepy at all. Being in a spaceship twelve light-years from home and having someone knock on the door is totally normal.”
Luckily, unlike Mark Watney, Ryland Grace is not quite alone. Yes, discovering the desiccated bodies of his crewmates makes him think that “I’m going to die out here. And I’m going to die alone” — but this is also a first contact story. (“I’ve gone from “sole-surviving space explorer” to “guy with wacky new roommate.” It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.”) And it plays out in the best possible way, because our alien engineer Rocky is by far one of the best SF characters ever. I mean it. Ever. 
 “I don’t want to look dumb in front of the aliens.Because they’re surely watching me right now. Probably counting my limbs, noting my size, figuring out what part they should eat first, whatever.”————“Humanity’s first miscommunication with an intelligent alien race. Glad I could be a part of it.”
 

There are no space battles or invasions or bad guys (well, minus the star-eating microbe that’s doing its star-eating microbe thing while threatening the existence of at least two sentient species in the universe) — nothing that would be typical for the genre. Instead we have smart science and solid reasoning and friendly collaboration that are at the forefront and serve to even out the seemingly insurmountable odds. There is a problem that needs to be solved — and so we are going to solve it, and it’s so much fun. Andy Weir is back in full force, and I’m ridiculously happy about that.
“What I’m really looking for is something like “Information” or “Here to save humanity? Press this button to learn more!”————“I decide on a more tactile approach: I’m gonna start pushing buttons!Hopefully there’s no “Blow Up the Ship” button.”
Just like The Martian, it’s one of those books that restore the faith in humanity even for the most jaded of us. Because when we put our minds to it we can cooperate and collaborate and do wonderful things.
“But there’s no reason aliens would follow the righty-tighty-lefty-loosey rule, is there?”
Oh, and I think I highlighted about half of this book, and I’m running out of the ways to include quotes in my review, so yeah. I love it.
“Oh thank God. I can’t imagine explaining “sleep” to someone who had never heard of it. Hey, I’m going to fall unconscious and hallucinate for a while. By the way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I can’t do it for a while, I go insane and eventually die. No need for concern.”
5 stars, safely Astrophage-free.——————Also posted on my blog.——————My Hugo and Nebula Awards Reading Project 2022","Andy Weir cannot write and I'm tired of people pretending he can.First, let's talk about characters- well, there is no character here. I only see a vague man-shaped science textbook in an astronaut suit. Wait, let me put my glasses on. OH, I know him. Quirky, wisecracking, nerd who likes space.. It's Mark Watney. Mark Watney's alone in the space, again. Oh. Can you believe his luck? Anyway, he's alone and he's quirky and nerdy and that's all very nicely boring but hold on.. there are flashback scenes. We get to meet other people. A diverse group of scientists from many countries to save the world. YAY.No, I take that back. No YAY. This is no diverse group of scientists. This is a collection of bad, outdated racial and character stereotypes stolen from bad Hollywood movies from white directors. Sure, the Russian drinks vodka. Asians speak with horrible accents. (I was ready to punch the narrator at that point.) Kids are all polite and interested in lessons and all laugh at the teacher's jokes. (This Mark Watney Pro Max is a schoolteacher and Andy Weir's never been in a classroom) The bossy female boss is bossy. Scientists make sex jokes that are not funny if you're not a 14 year old virgin. (Remember that famousThe Martian boobs emoticon? I just love Andy Weir's characters.) And of course, every one lovessss our hero. There's even a line in the book along the lines of  'everyone likes you better'  . Yes, really. It just grates on my nerves. It's obvious the author does not have much experiences with human relationships but instead of using that and giving his characters more life and making them awkward and human, he has to have them become HEROes: perfect little Gary Stus who are smart and nerdy social butterflies, and most popular guys in the multiverse.Wait, there's an alien. Oh my god, finally something interesting.......annd it's not. Rocky, the alien's character, had to be offensive to aliens if aliens read badly-written sci-fi books. He waves and thumbs up and mimics our hero because 1, that's logical we all mimic when we see another species make weird signs with their appendages and 2,because the alien has no culture of his own apart from what a 12 year old kid thinks how aliens eat, sleep and shit.Once they got talking, (yes they talked. I'll get to that later.), we finally learn Rocky's personality. It must be quite different from humans, coming from a different universe and all but wait a minute. He's nerdy and quirky and is talking like a certain human we know. *Gasps He's Mark Watney with eight legs. By now, we've already got a Mark Watney in the spacecraft Hail Mary. There is a Russian Mark Watney on Earth with vodka. Another Mark Watney with boobs. An Asian Mark Watney. Now there's an alien Mark Watney. It's an abundance of Mark Watneys. Who said this is not sci-fi horror? Mom, pick me up. I'm scared. So let's take a look at the plot maybe that's where the five star reviews get their stars from. But... but....there is no plot. I actually liked the idea of an apocalypse causing aliens being single celled bacterium kind of organisms but that's it. Apart from this, the rest of the whole plot is a childish daydream that could be concocted by any middle grade school children who have watched star trek once.It is juvenile to the point of embarrassing. A junior school-teacher is the hero Earth sent for the first ever interstellar mission? Okay. Sounds unrealistic but okay.Then he's the first person to be allowed to experiment on the astrophage (the alien space invaders). That's it. Just him in a laboratory. For a world-ending scientific discovery.One person is coordinating the entire multinational mission. And she's exempted from any legal repercussions. She's absurd to the point of not resembling a human female. Andy Weir would have us think she's a real human woman but I bet she's a robot and Andy Weir doesn't even know it.Two of the entire 3 person-crew died leaving only our hero. (Not a spoiler. Happens at the very beginning.) That's probably because Andy Weir knows he can't handle more than the astounding number of one character. So, he killed them off. Nice.He met an alien and everything goes smoothly because Our HERO figures out the alien language in record time. Of course. And not just general phrases but really long, completed sentences. Combine that with their shared personality or lack there of, makes their conversations sound like a kid playing astronauts and aliens by himself.And this all happens in the first chapters. The rest is just massive info dumps from our hero (I'll just keep saying our hero because that's what the MC and Andy Weir wants us to think. H.E.R.O.) because he's so smart and awesome and convenient problems arising only to be solved by, you guess it, our hero because he's so good at science stuff and, you know, so smart and awesome.This whole plot is a slap to the face but the ending? It's a kick to the groin. It's like Andy Weir thinks 'Well, you've endured this whole fairy tale, might as well get this cheesy and extremely implausible ending shoved down your throat. Goodbye.' This is not a book but a wish fulfilment of a childish sci-fi fantasy Andy Weir must have thought up during one boring physics class back in middle school and it's utterly embarrassing. If I had written it, I would not have showed it to my cat, let alone a publisher. At the end, Andy Weir did not make me care about Mark Watney Pro Max nor about Earth and apocalypse or Rocky even. Everything's just over the top and ridiculous. It's like a parody. Not a real novel.I saw that it's already been bought to be made into a movie. The Martian movie was 100000 times better and if this is turned into a movie, who knows? I might enjoy it. Maybe Andy Weir is better suited at drafting movie ideas than actually writing these not-books. Because honestly, this is the second time I've tried his writing and both times, I felt like I was trapped in an elevator during blackout with someone I can’t stand.","I think my job is to solve the Petrova problem.			 …in a small lab, wearing a bedsheet toga, with no idea who I am, and no help other than a mindless computer and two mummified roommates.
Guess I was wrong to resist reading this for months. Thing is, I liked The Martian and really really disliked Artemis. In fact, Weir's second novel bored and annoyed me so much that I was set against ever reading his future books. But after seeing positive review after positive review and having friends tell me to read this, I finally did. And Project Hail Mary was so much fun. And science-y. And a bit sad. But mostly fun.It's a different sort of story, but Project Hail Mary contains a lot of the stuff that made The Martian good. The stakes in the novel feel immense, the chance of coming up with a plan and getting out of the central predicament seems tiny, and all of this science drama is juxtaposed with the narrative voice-- basically, a funny, can't-help-but-love-him nerd who manages to put his brain to work in the direst of circumstances.We begin with Ryland Grace waking up on a spaceship with no idea who he is and how he got there. Exploring his surroundings, he quickly discovers that his crew mates are dead and he is humanity's last hope for survival. I won't reveal his mission because I think learning about it through flashbacks is part of the fun, and the more we learn the more impossible his mission seems.I'll leave it at that. The book alternates between the past in the run up to the mission as we discover the huge problem humanity faces, and the present in which Ryland Grace attempts to save our planet. The world of the novel gets bigger and wilder and I have to say I very much enjoyed the adventure and mystery.It's not five stars for me because I felt it ran on a little long in the middle with the characters having one nerdgasm after another (which seems to be a thing with Weir) and I also saw the ""twist"" coming, if you can call it that the one about what Stratt did. But the later chapters of the novel were really strong and quite... bittersweet, actually."
Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,3.99,"I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.

This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like... 

Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...

The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...

Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.3.0 Stars. Recommended.","Warning! The following review contains humor. If you read it and actually think that I'm being critical of Huxley, try reading it again. (Here's a hint. Look for the irony of the italicized parts when compared to the previous statements.) If you post a comment that asserts that I'm wrong/ stupid/ crazy for this and/or try to lecture me on all the points you think I missed then I'm going to assume that you read it literally, missed the joke, didn't read the other comments where I've already answered this about a dozen times, and I will delete your post. I have to apologize for this review. The concept of this book was so outlandish that I think it made my mind wander, and you may find some odd random thoughts scattered in it. Anyhow, this book was so silly and unrealistic. Like any of this could happen. In the far future the babies are genetically engineered and designed for certain stations in life with a large workforce bred to be happy with menial jobs that don’t stress them physically or mentally. I really should look into getting that data entry position I saw in the job postings. It’d be a lot less stressful than what I‘m doing now. In addition to all the genetic modifications, the children are raised by the state, and words like ’father’ and ’mother’ are considered obscenities. Subliminal messaging through infancy and childhood also condition people to repeat idiotic platitudes as if they are genuine wisdom. I’ve been in a bad mood today. I need to turn that frown upside down. And since the world economy depends on constant consumption by the highest classes, they’re encouraged to be wasteful The collars on a couple of my shirts are a little frayed. I should go buy some new ones and throw the old ones out. and to engage in activities that demand spending and resource use. Should I get a new set of golf clubs? I lost my old ones when we moved, but I hadn’t played in a long time. But would I play more if I got new clubs? There‘s that really nice looking course right down the street. I don‘t know how they keep the grass that green in this heat. The population even gets to zip around in their own private helicopters rather than cars. Man, when are they going to come out with jet packs for everyone. It’s 2011 and I’m still driving around in a car like a chump. I want my jet pack!Casual sex is actively encouraged. Wow. These condom commercials on TV have gotten really racy. The population is also programmed to be constantly partaking of some form of entertainment and to never just sit quietly and think I’m bored. Writing is boring. or to be alone Let’s check Facebook and see what all my friends are doing.One of the sillier ideas is that the foundation of this society is Henry Ford’s assembly lines and that Ford has become the most revered figure in history. Like a businessman could ever become that popular. Is Steve Jobs making any announcements this week? I get itchy when there‘s no new Apple products. While everyone seeks to be constantly entertained, all of the entertainment panders to the lowest common denominator. Hey, Jersey Shore is on! and the emphasis is on presenting it with gimmicks to engage the audience like ’the feelies’, movies that the audience can also smell and feel the sensation from. I wonder if they’ll re-release Avatar at the movies so I can see it in 3D again like James Cameron intended? At one point, a character complains about the feelies, “But they’re told by an idiot….works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.” I should go see that new Michael Bay Transformers movie.Perhaps the most far fetched idea in this is that the population has been trained to sedate themselves with a drug called soma that relives any potential anxieties and keeps people from thinking about anything upsetting. I want a beer.I guess this Huxley guy might have gotten lucky and predicted a few things, but he was way off base about where society was going.","“But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.” 

These are words uttered in the face of tyranny and complete oppression, though they are very rare words to be spoken or even thought of in this world because every human passion and sense of creativity is repressed and eradicated through a long and complex process of conditioning.And that’s what makes this novel so powerful; it’s not unbelievable. Like Orwell’s 1984 and Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale,  there’s just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It’s a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. And that's the wonder of speculative fiction, though unlike the other two books, there’s no violence involved in Huxley’s world. It’s just as controlling and scary, but it’s done in a more indirect way. Sex is on tap, everybody should be happy.People don’t go missing in the night nor are they stoned to death by a group of their peers, but they have just as little freedom (even if they don’t realise it.) In this dystopia they are trained from birth to think and feel in a certain way, and, for whatever reason, should they ever deviate from their ordained path, they are fed drugs that induce happiness and serenity; thus, the populace is kept within their desired space, and persist with the tasks they were born to do. Very few of them even consider that this is wrong; this is all they have known. And to make things even more maniacally clever, all physical and sexual needs are fulfilled completely as everybody belongs to everybody else in every sense with the ultimate goal of people never developing desire. All desire should be fulfilled, nobody wants for anything else. People are machines and houses are factories. They are mass produced and designed to be one thing and one thing only. All values are inverted. The idea of showing any emotion is horrific and repulsive. Love is unknown and alien. Death is associated with sweetness and relief. Children are fed candy when they are thought about death, so they associate the two together, so when as adults they see death they think of treats rather than the loss of someone they have known and worked beside for years. In Brave New World people are husks, empty and detached, without ever realising it.-John, the savage, as he enters the new worldI can only admire and praise Huxley’s genius through the writing. Like all effective dystopian societies, reading and information plays an exceedingly important role. As with Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451, all books have been destroyed and made inaccessible. John, one of the few characters who was born away from the new world, stumbles across a volume of Shakespeare and it changes his life. He can only think and feel in Shakespearean language and begins to view the world through a semi-romantic lens and only finds depravity when he walks into the new world. It’s everything he hates. He has been termed the savage, though he knows and understands the real meaning of the term even if those who call him such do not. Naturally, he becomes depressed and isolated in this new space, a space that he cannot be a part of or accepted in (not that he would want to be.) And I found him by far the most interesting and compelling character within the story because he is the only one to really look beyond the boundaries of his own experience and to find it wanting. So this is a terribly important novel and I can’t believe I have only just read it. If you haven’t read it already, you know what you have to do. This isn’t something to be missed. It’s a novel that made me think and imagine in a way a book hasn’t done in quite some time.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"
Six Days in Bombay,Alka Joshi,3.72,"Available 4/15I am a big fan of Alka Joshi, I adored her Henna Artist Trilogy. I couldn’t wait to read this new standalone storyYou are transported back to India. This time it is 1937, we meet Sona an Anglo-Indian nurse working in the Bombay Wadia Hospital.she is nursing Mira Novak a famous painter, who has suffered a miscarriage. Mira is in the hospital for six days. Sona and Mira become friends. Unfortunately Mira dies suddenly and Sona is blamed for her death. Sona is devastated. She is driven into scandal and mystery when a note is left for her to deliver three paintings to friends and former colleagues. But why?Sona takes the journey as per Mira’s request to Prague, Florence and Paris. It is a real life lesson for Sona who lived a sheltered existence. This is a beautifully written and researched novel It is a compelling story with engaging characters. This book has everything Historical Fiction, mystery and intrigue. Thank you to NetGalley and Harlequin Trade for this advanced readers copy.","This is a historical fiction set in the 1931 British-ruled India.Great concept and good writing.The storytelling was fabulous, but I must agree with the other readers who said that there were lots of telling and not showing.I enjoyed the showing of cultural differences and the descriptions of the setting.I know this is a work of fiction, but I found the development of the story a bit unrealistic, fiction or not.I didn’t find Mira that interesting, but I understood the main character’s admiration for her.I wanted more from the protagonist. She was too consumed by the idea of learning more about Mira’s life, and she forgot about herself. She became blinded by the idea of a life that she couldn’t have.And as for Sona trying to clear her name and go on a trip of discovery that will change her life? To me the author lost some direction.I really needed to feel that connection with the protagonist, but something was missing for me.Anyways, I highly recommend the audiobook. The narrator was fantastic and she made everything come to life.This was my fourth book by this author.ebook (Kobo): 352 pages, 114k words, 14 chapters.audiobook narrated by Sneha Mathan: 12.4 hours (normal speed), unabridged.","pre-read: I'm in a mood right now and this looks interesting, don't judge haha. 🫣"
The Gods Time Forgot,Kelsie Sheridan Gonzalez,3.43,"the title was intriguing and suggested a story that would really pull me in. unfortunately, that never came true. the plot was flat and uneventful, and I struggled to stay engaged. the romance, which seemed like it was supposed to be a central, lacked depth and development. I never really got a sense of connection between the characters, which made it hard to invest in their relationship or believe in their love. the writing style didn’t stand out. It didn’t add much energy or emotion to it, it only added to lack of momentum. at times, it felt like the story was just drifting along without a strong direction. and the ending reveal was the most boring plots I’ve read in my whole life. the only one redeeming quality was the audiobook production. the narration was solid and helped make the experience more bearable, even though the content itself didn’t quite land for me.— thank you alcove press for an arc!!","જ⁀➴3.5 starsThank you to NetGalley and Alcove Press for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.

I'm a sucker for anything that's a retelling of any culture's mythology or mythology-inspired, so once I heard that this was 1870s New York City meets Irish mythology, I knew I couldn't pass it up. I feel like there aren't enough stories out there that are set during the Gilded Age so I knew this was also something I wanted to read about.
↳Just a quick history lesson on the Gilded Age for anyone who comes across this review and isn't American or just forgot from US History class in high school so we can set the stage: the Gilded Age is a period in American history that spans from the 1870s to the early 1900s. It was the beginning of industrialization and urbanization in America; people were starting to build their wealth, immigrants were coming in to grow the population and start a brand new life for themselves, and inventions like the telephone and electricity were launched. However, it was called the ""Gilded Age"" because while everything seemed amazing and everything was growing, in reality, a lot was going on underneath the surface. Women still didn't have the right to vote, working conditions in factories were abysmal, wealth inequality was starting to show between the upper and lower classes, there was a lot of political corruption going on, and things like basic cleanliness and regulations in regards to food and drug handling and processing were essentially nonexistent.
While I did enjoy some aspects of the story, there's also a lot that I felt was missing or I needed more of. The story felt very repetitive at times when Rua would go to a ball/social event with her ""family,"" she acts out because she's the only person in the room with more than 2 brain cells and thinks that the customs and rules of NYC high society are stupid, everyone shuns her and gives her the stink eye, Flossie Harrington (ugh, I hate that nickname) threatens to send her to an asylum, her family gets embarrassed to then get her ass saved by Lord Donore and no one wants to disappoint Lord Donore because he's a rich, eligible bachelor that people want their daughters to marry. There were parts of the story that seemed more drama-packed because of Manhattan's high society culture and lifestyle and Rua struggling to fit into a life that wasn't hers to begin with rather than the fantasy part of the romantasy (more on this later), but I personally didn't mind it at all because I like books where we get to sneak a peek at the happenings of the upper class and see how they live with their frivolous customs and mannerisms. They're so out of touch that I can't help but find it somewhat amusing to read about but I can see how people would easily get bored of reading about Rua going to another ball or going to the seamstress to get gowns made for her. The Harringtons remind me of the Featheringtons from Bridgerton if you've watched the show at all. Now, my biggest gripe with this book is the fantasy portion, or lack thereof. I didn't feel like there was a whole ton of ""fantasy"" in the ""romantasy"" that this book was marketed as. There's aspects of Irish mythology woven throughout the story and it does tie in with Rua and Finn, but it didn't become a major aspect of the story until literally the last 20% of the book. I remember hitting the 80% mark and thinking to myself, ""So...where does the fantasy aspect come in?"" I know a big part of this is because Rua shows up with no recollection of her past life and has to impersonate Emma Harrington, the Harringtons' missing daughter, but once Rua starts finding out more about Emma's life, it all felt like a historical fiction book where a girl tries to fit in with NYC upper society by going to balls and keeping up with public appearances with a side of ""she finds out that the girl she's pretending to be dabbled in the occult and witchcraft."" Sure, there are brief flashbacks here and there once Rua starts to gain her memories back but they weren't long or frequent enough for me to feel like there was a prominent fantasy aspect in the story.The entire ending of the story felt extremely rushed and ended abruptly. I feel like the author got so caught up in trying to have Rua fit in with society that she almost forgot to explain why Rua got there in the first place and how Finn ties into it all. I don't know if this is a new trend with books now because I felt this happened with 3/4 of the most recent ARCs I read or if this is just because I'm reading and reviewing the ARC so there's no guarantee that this is how the actual published work is going to end, but the ending felt as if the author tried to tie everything up in a nice little bow and used a ton of oh-so-convenient plot devices to make the ending feel complete. There was a lot more action in the last 20% of the book than there was in the first 80% but it also ended as quickly as it came which was disappointing, to say the least. (The reasoning behind Emma going missing is also really stupid, too. I won't say how or why but I couldn't roll my eyes any harder.)The romance was definitely there, and there was a lot of drama to go with it, too. There is a love triangle involved so if you like love triangles more than I do, you might enjoy reading about Rua, Finn, and Annette. I don't like love triangles because most of them aren't really a true triangle per se and it's somewhat obvious who the main character and/or main love interest is going to end up with and this was one of those situations. This is NOT a spicy romantasy if anyone was looking for that, so if you read clean romance or like closed-door books over open-door, this might be the romantasy book for you! I don't mind either way, but I did like Rua and Finn's connection and that deja vu feeling they had with each other.Overall, I would say I enjoyed it and I liked the writing, but I felt the fantasy aspect of the story could've been more prominent. It's marketed as a romantasy, and while both aspects were there and the romance between Rua and Finn plays a large part in the plot, the fantasy aspect of it didn't really play a huge role until the last few pages and then abruptly stopped. While I did enjoy the Irish mythology woven through the story and the decadence of the upper class throughout the story--this isn't a topic I know a whole ton about so I enjoyed learning more about it!--the lack of fantasy aspects up until the last bit of the story sort of offsets everything.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁Trigger warnings/content warnings: blood, violence, gore, sexism, murder, witchcraft/Paganism (if this is something that's taboo for you), institutionalization, mentions of prostitution, amnesia, blackmail, bribery, very mild sexual content (it's not even a chili pepper spicy, it's like a bell pepper in my opinion)(P.S.

Isn’t it amazing how words on pages can do that? This is set in 1870 ; where women weren’t allowed to have opinions or display any ounce of intelligence. It was definitely frustrating at times… and quite angering. I don’t remember the last time I was this angry. So I know the author did a magnificent job. Rua wakes up in Emma’s body, 2 days after Emma’s disappearance. Since Emma was already considered *problematic* ; Rua’s weird temperament didn’t really ring bells for a while. Rua was an absolutely fabulous FMC. She rapidly grew on me. The strong suit of this book is definitely the romance. The banter was chiefs kiss 💋. It was definitely swoon worthy.There’s 2 points that could be worked on. The pacing and the ending. The ending is so abrupt! It just made me feel like when my partner is telling me a story and I feel there’s more to his story but he just stops there. I highly wish there was an epilogue.***Thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for a chance to review this ARC!***"
The Library of Lost Dollhouses,Elise Hooper,4.00,"A very hesitant four stars. Not because it’s a bad book, but it just didn’t have enough detail for me. Two of my favorite things wrapped into one - libraries and miniatures.Tilda works at a historical library museum in San Francisco, and one day, she uncovers a secret room filled with two of the most detailed dollhouses she's ever seen. She quickly uncovers the history of the creator and the story behind them.The entire backstory is draped in a very quick history and mix of WWI and WWII, secret loves, art history, family histories, women who worked under cover during the wars, even Walt Disney is thrown into the mix.While this could actually be a much longer detailed historical fiction book about how women were a key component to working during the wars, it instead is a very quick read on how the dollhouses have shaped Tilda's entire existence.In the end, while this book isn't bad, I found it to be not as immersive as it could have been. I left having more questions than answers. Either it should have been more about the wartime era, or more about the creation of the dollhouses themselves.","3.5 ⭐Tildy Barrows is the head curator of a beautiful library in San Francisco, a place she not only considers her workplace but also her home. Thriving off of a neat and scheduled routine, Tildy makes an unexpected discovery in the library that rocks her world and changes not only the library’s future but her life as well. She discovers dollhouses. But they aren’t just any dollhouses, no, these miniatures of exquisite homes hold secrets about the women who lived in each house the dollhouses replicated. From the glistening streets of Paris to war-stricken England to sunny California, Tildy embarks on a journey to know the meaning behind each clue hidden in the miniatures and understand how and why she is connected to the artist. First off, the cover is adorable.Second off, the book itself wasn’t adorable, but the story was good, and I enjoyed reading it. It did seem to drag on a bit at the beginning, but once you hit the 35-40% mark, it gets really interesting. The story flowed well, even with the POV switches. The writing was easy to read and had a good balance of dialogue and description. The plot was good and well-structured; I didn’t feel confused or left in the dark about anything that occurred or about any of the characters. The setting was a perfect fit, and I particularly loved the bits about Paris and England. And the history behind everything was so fun! I admit that I am not a fan of building dollhouses or miniatures of anything because I can’t build one for the life of me, but it was so cool to read about how to make one and how beautiful they are when they are completed. It was also great to see how women managed to do what they loved despite it being ""a man's world."" What I did have a problem with was the characters. Not that they were horrible human beings, but they seemed kind of…bland. I didn’t connect with the characters like I wanted to, but I rooted for them nonetheless because I understood their struggles and wanted them to overcome them somehow beyond the pages. 😂 It felt like the book was more for and about the dollhouses than the characters, which is why I’m giving this a 3.5 and not four stars. This book, for me, is a one-and-done type of book. I read it once. Great. I’ll maybe recommend it to a friend or two. I’ll keep it on the shelf. On to the next book. 🙂 I received an arc from William Morrow via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

Happy Land,Dolen Perkins-Valdez,4.32,"""This place wasn’t just our home. It was our refuge.""This was so beautiful! It’s one of those stories that quietly draws you in until, by the end, you're left feeling completely unraveled in the best way. At first, I was just trying to get my bearings, figuring out who everyone was and what the hell was going on. But by the time I reached the end, I was completely immersed in the characters and their deeply moving story:a hidden gem of history that felt so personal.“When we call ourselves kings and queens, it isn’t just a fantasy of black pride. It means something.”What makes this story so powerful is how human the characters are. It's about how generations carry so much history. It’s really up to the future generations to hold onto any pieces of the past they can get. Watching the present-day characters fight to keep their land was witnessing them fight to preserve their family’s freedom, their strength, and their story. It wasn’t just a piece of land—it was a symbol of hope, resilience, and legacy. Every choice the characters made felt so real and layered. I may not stand some of them (looking at you, Montgomery brothers🧐) but I understood why they felt they needed to do some of the things they did. I’m a strong believer in accountability regardless of the reasons, but the way Perkins-Valdez writes these characters makes it nearly impossible not to feel compassion for them. One of my favorite things to do after finishing a book is to lightly research the history behind it, and this “Happy Land” gave me something to look into. It was amazing to learn that it’s based on a real place, where African Americans sought peace. At first, I thought it was that simple. But when they referred to it as a “kingdom” with a king and queen, I was reminded of the deep African heritage so many hold—where kingdoms, even small ones, were once thriving and I think still kinda do across various African countries. That understanding added so much richness to the story for me.This book also brings to light the staggering loss of land worth millions that was stolen from African Americans, connecting to the racial disparities we still see today. Dolen Perkins-Valdez reveals this painful truth while still giving us a story brimming with love, hope, and resilience.After being blown away by Take My Hand, I had a feeling I was might be obsessed with whatever she released next—and here we are. Her writing is so deceptively simple, yet packed with emotional depth and historical weight. I can’t wait to see what hidden piece of history she brings to light next.","Dolen Perkins-Valdez is a literary treasure, finding actual moments in our history that are somehow both unknown and dramatic -- and critical to understanding the American character and soul. In this beautiful, powerful, surprising novel, she brings to life the remarkable story of a community of self-governing freepeople in the decades after the Civil War, and its undiscussed legacy. What was it like in Happy Land in the 1870s and 1880s -- and what does that legacy mean for four generations of women in one family in present day America? I loved this novel: every page makes clear the ways historical fiction move us as only the very best novels can.","A granddaughter is summoned to a small North Carolinian town by her estranged grandmother, where she is shocked to learn her family’s origin story and the history of the land on which the property resides. I continue to be nothing short of impressed with novelist Dolen Perkins-Valdez and her gripping and evocative stories based on such vital moments in history. In this, her sophomore novel, she explores the sense of community building and connections formed in a small North Carolina town, between those who were formerly enslaved, now living in their own kingdom deemed “Happy Land.” This is a story filled with sadness, and yet, is ultimately incredibly uplifting. I loved the idea that they brought a piece of their African heritage to North Carolina and created their own Kingdom there in NC. While the narrators, both in the past and present, walk us through the legacy of the family and their land, as well as their rich family history, the underpinning that shines through is the idea of community and of finding those connections to the past. At its core, this story gives voices to the countless African American families who have lost the lands they worked to make their own. One element that worked so well stylistically is the parallel the author develops between how this family came to own the land and then lost it (in the past) and how they were able to take it back once again (in the present). Tying back in the hardships of today with those of the past. This story is very character-driven, but in the best of ways. Our MC in the present, Nikki, struggles with a sense of isolation, her family no longer speaking to one another. And yet when she learns more about this large, interwoven family she never really knew she had, as well as their history, she feels a part of something so much bigger, no longer feeling alone as she had. And while romance is certainly not at the center of the story, it is the thread that is so beautifully weaved throughout much of these characters’ lives. There are a couple of truly remarkable love stories, one centered around the most romantic kind of love, and one of deep friendship, born from the hardships life had brought their way, both as heartbreaking as they are balm for the soul. 🎧 The audiobook, narrated by Bahni Turpin and Ashley J. Hobbs, is absolute perfection. They gave voice to each of these dynamic characters in such a powerful and unique way, and I found myself unable to put this book down the entire time I was reading it. I highly recommend doing this as an immersive read, audiobook combined with the physical book, for the best both formats have to offer.

The Pretender,Jo Harkin,4.08,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Historical FictionWhen The Pretender was made available for advanced reading on NetGalley, I couldn’t resist requesting it. This historical novel is set at the end of the Plantagenet dynasty and the beginning of the Tudor reign. The story reimagines the life of Lambert Simnel, who was used for the Yorkist rebellion against King Henry VII. It starts with Lambert being known as John, the twelve-year-old peasant boy, who one day is taken away by a stranger claiming he is the son of George, the Duke of Clarence (killed by his brother King Edward IV). The stranger says the boy’s identity was hidden to protect him from threats. Lambert is then sent to Oxford to get the education he needs as a royal heir. Through his eyes, we follow his journey that is filled with danger, obstacles, political intrigue, self-discovery, and hunger for power. The worldbuilding in this novel is so rich and vivid. The author did a terrific job drawing a clear picture of all the aspects of this world, whether it is the court, social structures, the nobility, or the medieval feel of it. Everything is well explained and described. The book is also beautifully written, like literary fiction. Being told during a turbulent period of England’s history ensures the story has lots of deception, backstabbing, uncertainty, and twists that complement the political ambitions of the involved characters. The characters are complex and multilayered, making them perfect for the story. I enjoyed reading the story because I have enough background about many of the characters in this book. Those unfamiliar with the Plantagenet and Tudor eras should read about their conflict and the War of the Roses before reading this story. I don’t know how much I would have liked this book or understood the events if I had no idea about the characters and their historical background. If you are a big fan of historical fiction of that era, you should not skip this one.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with the ARC of this book.","I finished Jo Harkin's The Pretender last night. I was so, so close to the end and wanted to finish, but kept drifting off and almost dropping my ereader each time I woke up with a judder. The Pretender is one of those books that's wonderful from the start, the kind where one wants to whisper ""Please stay this good. Please stay this good."" over and over while reading. And it did stay that good. It may even have gotten better.The Pretender is full of the sorts of elements I love: a pretender to the English throne (no real surprise there); language close enough to modern to make it a comfortable read, but also with some great period vocabulary that I found delightful; lots of humor—some straightforward, some cruel, some heartbreaking; and questions of goodness and goals and power in a time so far from ours that it's completely different and familiar all at once.The novel begins in the lead-up to the battle between Richard III and Henry VI that ends with Richard's tragic death (""A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"") and Henry's ascent to the throne. Unlike Shakespeare's Richard III, The Pretender isn't a story of one hero and one villain. It's a story of many, many characters, including a few women—some in beyond their depth, others expert in the political machinations of the time. And then there's the Pretender himself, who goes through a number of name changes during the book, but I'm going to stay with Lambert Simnel, since that's the name most familiar to me. Raised on a farm (and known as John at the time), Simnel finds himself handed over by the man he thought was his father to a minor cleric who is entrusted with educating him in both scholarly and courtly knowledge. Simnel is told he's the real son of George, Duke of Clarence, (brother to Edward IV and Richard III), and he's being prepared to rise to his rightful rank, triumphing over Richard or Henry, whichever one of them is in power when Simnel is ready to be revealed and crowned as Edward VI. (Edward V was one of the two princes who died in the Tower of London.)There is however another potential Edward VI, the boy who has been raised as Clarence's legitimate son. Simnel has been told the two of them were switched at birth, with the ""real"" Edward actually being a decoy of sorts. In fact, Simnel never knows who he truly is. Is he royalty? Is he a usurper being manipulated by anti-Henry VI Yorkists? Is he just another expendable decoy in what could be a long line of such boys?We readers have the pleasure of watching Simnel emerge from unsophistication and innocence to a young man deeply troubled by all he's learning about politics and war to a... and I'll stop here because I don't want to deprive anyone of the pleasure of reading the book in their own sort of lectorish innocence.I know without a doubt that The Pretender will be on my list of best books of 2025. It's just that good.I received a free electronic review copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley; the opinions are my own.","*4.5 stars rounded up The Pretender is based on the true story of Lambert Simnel, an imposter who claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, to gain the English crown. This historical fiction novel gives a voice and a deeper understanding of a misunderstood historical figure. I loved John as a main character and Joan was truly remarkable! Deeply poignant, humorous, and even a few twists, the book is very well written filled with literary prose. With dimensional characters and vivid settings, this historical fiction novel isn't one I will be forgetting anytime soon! I'm not sure how historically accurate Jo Harkin’s account is but you can tell she researched the time period extensively. Historical fiction and literary fiction readers are going to love this one! I truly could not put this one down so I alternated between reading the book myself and listening to the audiobook. The audiobook is read by John Hollingworth who did an amazing job. If you decide to pick this one up, I highly recommend this format! The Pretender by Jo Harkin will be available on April 22. A massive thanks to AA Knopf for the gifted copy and Penguin Random House Audio for the gifted audiobook!"
The River Knows Your Name,Kelly Mustian,4.00,"My Reviews Can Also Be Found On: The Book Review Crew BlogI loved Kelly Mustian's debut novel, 
The Girls in the Stilt House
, so it was a no-brainer to request this from NetGalley. The book is deeply emotional and weaves two tales that take the reader on a journey from the Depression-era American South to the 1970s. Southern historical fiction is my favourite genre, so it's no surprise that I absolutely loved this one.Dual timelines are a favourite format for me, and as usual, I loved the older timeline, BUT with the second being far back in the 1970s, I found that a plus. They're both complex storylines but are skillfully interwoven and seamlessly reveal the connection between the characters and their shared history.The setting is atmospheric and took me to the Mississippi Delta and the North Carolina mountains in my head. I can't forget to mention the river of the title, as it is a character in and of itself and is a big part of the characters' lives. The characters are complex, and so are their backgrounds; each has their struggles and vulnerabilities to deal with. I liked how the author showed how family secrets from the past can affect the present and even the future. The women in these two timelines are strong and resilient and do whatever they can to protect those they love and survive. I enjoyed being on this journey with Nell, Becca, Evie and Hazel and their search for the truth.Overall, this book was compelling and beautifully written and will be enjoyed by anyone who loves historical fiction with strong female leads and detailed, complex storytelling. All. The. Stars.(MY FIRST FIVE-STAR READ OF 2025!)Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.","The novel takes place in alternating time frames relating the stories of sisters Nell and Evie and their mother in 1971 North Carolina and Becca’s story in 1932 Mississippi. There are vague memories and secrets unfolding about Nell and Evie’s childhood. My interest was held as Becca’s story unfolds and as it moves back and forth in the time frames. I was anxious for the stories to merge. While I was emotionally connected in the beginning , and even in the end, too many characters kept appearing. It would have been a more meaningful story for me if the connections were kept more simple . The story line at times felt a bit too much , almost soap opera like, and the basic story introduced in the earlier part of the book got diluted for me . Overall, I was disappointed. I will give it a generous three stars because I genuinely liked the characters I wanted to discover as they did what happened. I received a copy of this from Sourcebooks through Edelweiss. I read this with my book buddy , Diane. Wish we had read one we liked more. Hopefully, next time .","Which character is keeping the most secrets in this beautifully written dual timeline read?The writing and storyline are just pull-you-in amazing.We meet Hazel, Nell, Evie, Becca, Ben, and Mildred.Evie is the connection to both time periods and families in both the 1930s and in 1971.We follow Becca and Evie as they go through their days without Becca’s husband and Evie’s father Ben.Becca finds out that her nasty mother-in-law, Mildred, kept information about her husband from her, and she does some other horrible things to Becca.We also follow Hazel, Nell, and Evie as adults as we see what their life is like now and as they try to figure out what really happened during their childhood and the secrets their mother kept.A marvelous, heartfelt, as well as heartbreaking read with wonderful characters you will love and feel for.You will not want to put the book down, and you will need tissues at times. THE RIVER KNOWS YOUR NAME has intrigue and is a you-have-to-know-how-it-all-happened read and how it all turns out. 5/5Thank you to the publisher for a copy of this book. All opinions are my own."

The Mademoiselle Alliance,Natasha Lester,4.40,"EXCERPT: ""What are you fighting for?""He's the first person who's asked me this and I almost snap a retort at the condescension that probably lurks beneath the question. But Léon's expression is curious, as if he's looking for someone who wants the same thing he does. ""I have two children,"" I say very carefully, because thinking about how long it's been since I held them makes me want to cry, and speaking of them is the hardest thing of all. ""I never want . . .""Béatrice's blonde hair unfurls in my mind. My hands quiver, wanting to braid those tresses. Are they still long, falling to the middle of her back?Mothers should know those things. But I only know this: ""I never want my children to believe that their mother taught them to sit back and accept something that they know is wrong.""I almost don't add this last thing, but it spills out. ""My youngest is a girl, and I can't bear her knowing only a world that shuts women in a trap from the moment they're born. Based on what's happened in Germany, the Nazis are readying that trap for France.""Léon is silent for a moment, staring at the empty glass in his hand. Then he says softly, ""That's worth fighting for."" ABOUT 'THE MADEMOISELLE ALLIANCE': How did a young Parisienne mother, celebrated for her beauty and glamour, come to lead the largest spy network in France?Morocco, 1928. Eighteen-year-old Frenchwoman Marie-Madeleine is not the kind of woman who goes through life sitting down, something her new husband can attest. Her unconventionalities - rally car driving, flying planes and dabbling in intelligence work for the government - earn her a reputation, but she knows who she is - an adventurer.Paris, 1938. As Europe teeters on the brink of war, a chance encounter with a mysterious man codenamed Navarre turns Marie-Madeleine's life upside down. Recruited to help build a resistance network known only as Alliance, she conceals her identity - and gender - as she navigates a perilous double life away from her children and the man she loves. Capture and death are only a heartbeat away.MY THOUGHTS: Natasha Lester brings to life the true story of one of history's unsung heroes, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, the only woman to lead a military intelligence network in WWII France. Her story is one of epic love, tragic loss and magnificent leadership.Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was a brave woman, an extraordinary woman. Mother. Rally-car driver. Journalist. A woman who was at the top of the Gestapo's most wanted list. A woman whose heart was broken over and over again by treachery, by the war, but who kept fighting because it was the right thing to do.This is a story about the very best people, those who endangered their own lives and the lives of their loved ones and associates, and the very worst people in the world, those who tortured, destroyed, raped, pillaged and killed.At one point the Gestapo pushed in Marie-Madeleine Fourcade’s door while hunting for French Resistance spies. They shoved her aside, ransacking her apartment for information about an important member of the Resistance cell known as “Alliance.” Little did they know its ringleader was Fourcade herself. The inability to recognize—let alone even imagine—a woman spymaster wasn’t just a German shortcoming: throughout, the same proves true of men on all sides of World War II, including MI6 in London.Fourcade was the revered leader of thousands of men and women who, as members of a military intelligence network and at the cost of their own lives, resisted Nazi domination. She was a master of disguise, intelligent, resourceful, and cunning, but most of all incredibly brave.I, and I assume most of us, had never heard of this woman, but once I became immersed in Marie-Madeleine's story, I did more research online and learned something more of her story, and then the author's note at the end of this book (make sure you read it) answered many more of my questions. She also lists her sources for this novel, and I have asked my local library to try and obtain some of these for me. She explains the liberties she took with the truth and the characters in order to produce a readable novel, and eminently readable it is. The Mademoiselle Alliance is not a quick read. There were days I had to put it down and walk away, overwhelmed, sickened, afraid for this amazing woman and her children. I cried. Copiously. I was also amazed by the strength, determination and courage of Marie-Madeleine and, like the author, developed a 'hero-worship' of her. There are many other wonderful characters in this novel, Léon, Lucien, to name but two - but I shall leave you to discover them for yourself. After the harrowing opening to this novel, there came a point where I worried that this was going to be superficial and nothing more than a love (yes, love - not romance) story set against the backdrop of WWII. How wrong I was.Thank you, Natasha Lester. I have rediscovered my love of history through your passion and your storytelling.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐#TheMademoiselleAllianceNatashaLester #NetGalleyMEET THE AUTHOR: Natasha lives in Perth, Western Australia with her 3 children and loves fashion, history, practicing the art of fashion illustration, collecting vintage fashion, travelling and, of course, books. Prior to writing, she worked as a marketing executive for L’Oreal, managing the Maybelline brand, before returning to university to study creative writing.DISCLOSURE: Thank you to Hachette Australia and New Zealand for providing an e-ARC of The Mademoiselle Alliance by Natasha Lester for review. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own personal opinions.https://sandysbookaday.wordpress.com/...","Just read this one for a cover quote and it will stay with me a long time--a passionate, fiery tribute to a historical woman so extraordinary she almost defies belief. Marie-Madeleine is a young Parisienne with style and verve to burn, equally happy cuddling her young children, driving racecars, or learning to fly planes--but she'll need more than verve when her beloved France is invaded by the Nazis. Recruited to help build a resistance network known as Alliance, she lives on the run and comes to command thousands who revere her, even as she grieves the necessity of sending her children away to safety, and mourns every time she loses one of her spies to the Gestapo. Natasha Lester writes with razor-sharp research and evident admiration for a woman whose name deserves to be blazed across the pages of history.","'My place is the air, the void, the very edges of existence. And from that place, I manage 3,000 agents, the only network that covers the whole of France'.Marie-Madeleine is just a 30 year old mother of two, living in France, estranged from her husband, when the reality of Hitler's impending advancement becomes clear. When asked to help courier some bits of information to British intelligence, she deosn't hesitate. Little does she know that not only is this the dawn of WW2 escalating, it's the introduction to the evolution of the French Resistance. Although clearly a woman with gumption, if her rally car racing and aviation skills were anything to go by, ultimately it was her dogged resilience, in the face of fascism, that propelled to become the leader of the largest, nation-wide resistance group- Alliance.This a great piece of historical fiction based on the real life Marie-Madeline. A mother who utterly resisted the idea of Germany’s occupation of France and all they stood for. Lester does well to give a feminine voice and mother’s perspective to the violence of war, ‘The train draws into the Gare de Lyon in Paris…I leave behind the mother who has no children and become, once more Herisson’.Firm fans of Lester’s fiction, will not be disappointed with this latest addition. It also another coup for bringing women written in the margins of fiction to the fore.‘It will make you believe in the power of a few courageous souls, led by one remarkable woman, to change lives and give humankind back its freedom’."
Tough Luck,Sandra Dallas,3.98,"My Reviews Can Also Be Found On: The Book Review Crew Blog
You are fourteen and a girl and have no rights. Tough luck.
I loved Sandra Dallas’ book 
Where Coyotes Howl
 and Tough Luck didn't disappoint. I love the female lead in this one. Let me introduce you to 14-year-old Haidie Richards. After her mom dies Haidie’s older brother sells the farm and puts Haidie and her younger brother, Boots in an orphanage. Well, Haidie is having none of that so she and Boots escape to go west to look for their dad in Denver. She cuts her hair, dons some trousers and decides to be a boy so that she can be allowed to help with the oxen in mules. Haidie is resilient and strong in both body and mind. She was such a wonderful caretaker of her brother Boots, the animals in her care and even the other travellers in her group. She had such courage and belief in herself when trying to find her father.This is a short book that packs a punch with very long chapters yet they didn’t feel long while I was reading them. This was such a beautifully heartbreaking story and the characters felt like real people I'd like to meet. I came to appreciate how hard it must have been to live through that time period and Dallas always does that with her books. I love the way the plot unfolded and how well the story flowed and the ending left me feeling satisfied.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.","HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY 4/29/25!!!
Who me? Reading a Western? This is a Sandra Dallas novel, so yes, I am...In 1863, when their mother dies, Haidie Richards, 14, and her younger brother, Boots, 10, live in an orphanage, but not for long. They soon escape and plan to head from Smoak, IL, to the Colorado Territory. They're in search of their father, Manley, who left four years ago with a severe case of gold fever and high hopes of striking it rich.Boots and Haidie, disguised as a boy, gain passage with folks traveling to the Western Territory and learn hard and fast lessons along the way. Once they arrive in Colorado, their lessons are far from over... Tough Luck is a story I enjoyed with a compelling storyline, wonderful characters, and simple descriptive writing that immerses you in the timeline of the 1860s and the culture of the West. I love Haidie, our main character, who held the weight of this story on her tiny shoulders. Dallas made a wise choice by placing the first-person narration of this story in the hands of this brave character. She is a little spitfire! This was an immersion read; the audiobook is narrated by Mia Hutchinson-Shaw, who recounts the story flawlessly in an accentuated voice appropriate for the timeline and delivers the perfect first-person voice for Haidie. The result is an entertaining listening experience.This was not the first Sandra Dallas novel I have read. I read her second novel, The Persian Pickle Club, five years ago and loved it. I must admit, though, I fell in love with that beautiful, colorful cover first. Take a look for yourself and see if you agree. Tough Luck was enjoyable to read and listen to, and just as I said when I finished The Persian Pickle Club, I need to read more from this talented author! 4.25⭐Thank you to St. Martin's Press, Macmillan Audio, and Sandra Dallas for a DRC and an ALC through NetGalley. This is my honest and voluntary review.","3.5 stars.Illinois, 1863. Boots, Haidie and Cheet’s father left the family home in search of gold and wealth in Colorado four years ago. Their mother passes, leaving the family farm for Cheet, the eldest sibling, to run. Cheet sells the farm for much less than it’s worth and abandons his younger siblings, planning to move on with his life without them dragging him down. Boots and Haidie make a plan to venture west in search of their father who they feel is sure to have found wealth and will welcome them back into his life. This book was full of adventure. Haidie and Boots were incredible characters. I loved their relationship dynamic and that Haidie was more a mother figure than sister. Their bond was one of my favourite parts of this novel. The story is brilliantly told through Haidie’s perspective, which I loved. She was charming and entertaining with her inner thoughts. She was mature but still had a young innocence about her. Haidie and Boots find themselves in a variety of situations that is sure to have the reader entertained, emotional and rooting for them.There are many characters introduced along their journey. Each new encounter unravels a unique layer to their story and enhances their personal growth. In a way, this is their coming of age story, but its also an entertaining romp through the American frontier. Several dangerous situations arise that had me worried and anxious. But there are also several surprising and heartwarming circumstances involving the kindness of strangers.I am always fascinated to learn about this time period. The Wild West, where danger lurks beyond every grueling mile travelled into unknown territory. The bravery of people who embarked on this vast, hopeful and mysterious journey is inspiring.I truly enjoyed following these unforgettable characters throughout their journey. Although I wouldn’t call this intense, gripping or fast paced, I cared deeply for the characters and will always remember them. I would have preferred more grit and realness, as I found a lightness to the writing that kept me from fully immersing myself in the atmosphere and storyline. I also found the ending wrapped up too neatly which had me lower my rating, but I can understand how this will please many readers.Audio rating: 5 stars! The audio narrator did an excellent job narrating and greatly enhanced my connection to the book. Her tone, inflections and pauses were perfectly plotted. She had a twang to her pronunciations that had me feeling the atmosphere of the time period. I highly recommend the audio!Special mention for this stunning cover! Thank you to the publisher for my physical and audio copy!This novel publishes on April 29th. Be sure to get your hands on a copy!"
The Traitor of Sherwood Forest,Amy S. Kaufman,3.72,"In a Nutshell: A historical fiction retelling the story of Robinhood from the perspective of one of his female group members. Loved the intent, especially the idea of presenting the original picture of Robinhood from medieval ballads. However, the execution didn’t work for me. This felt more like YA fiction (except that it isn’t YA-friendly.) Bland narrator, minimal character development, and a lot of needless focus on physical attraction (with an equally unnecessary romantic triangle.) It might work better for those who don’t read much historical fiction but are interested in a Robinhood retelling. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview:Jane is an ordinary peasant girl with an uncaring mother more interested in her own dalliances and elder brothers who don’t have much time for their only sister. So when her beau Bran suggests that she work for the infamous Lord of the Greenwood, Jane is taken aback but willing to give her new assignment a try. What initially seems to be a straightforward spy job soon turns into a challenging game of keeping ahead. Further complicating the matter is Jane’s attraction to Robinhood, whose behaviour doesn’t seem to match his reputation. When things escalate beyond control, Jane is forced to take some tough decisions.The story comes to us mostly in Jane’s third-person perspective.PSA: The blurb reveals too much, including an important spoiler from the final quarter. I’ve never read a Robinhood retelling, and I’ve not read the original ballads. What I know of this legendary character is limited to what I have watched in a couple of Hollywood movies, which are obviously not historically accurate, and a children’s abridged storybook. As such, I had been looking forward to this novel with great anticipation. I still remember how happy I had been when I got this ARC. Unfortunately, the writing style, the plot development, and the characters didn’t click for me at all.Bookish Yays:🎯 The author’s note. Brilliant in every way, this note explains her writing choices and offers insight into the legend. Had the writing actually matched up to the thoughts expressed here, the novel would have easily crossed 4 stars for me. 🎯 I like the intent of representing the original portrayal of Robinhood from the medieval ballads, which doesn't match his modern-day image of a hero. Was he written well? No. But I appreciated the less-idealised and supposedly authentic take, and learnt a lot about some of his beliefs and controversies. Bookish Mixed Bags:🏹 Ibota, the prioress – the only character written well, but in a relatively limited role. I might even have liked hearing this story from her perspective. 🏹 The ending. Faithful to the legends, but abrupt in its execution. Bookish Nays: ➴ A wavering tempo, with the proceedings either being too slow (especially at the start with each event going on for an overly long time) or too rushed (especially in the final section.) The action is meagre at the start and overloaded at the end.➴ Jane as a narrator – so bland! She is sometimes observational, but her perspective includes a lot of ‘telling’, which is difficult to accept considering her ignorance. (Some of the telling is just unbelievable. How the heck would you see “healthy thighs” under medieval gowns?) There’s also a lot of repetition in her narration. Multiple times, she's surprised to find that characters are taller than she thought they were. ➴ All the scenes of longing and lust! I missed seeing the word ‘sultry’ in the blurb, but even if I had, I wouldn’t have thought that it would be so dominant in a historical retelling. Even in between serious discussions, we get information about the salacious stirrings Jane feels at Robin's sight. Ugh!➴ To make it worse, there’s a partial romantic triangle, with Jane constantly swerving between Bran and Robinhood. This is the worst-written of the subplots. When Jane is with Bran, she wants Robin, and when she’s with Robin, she longs for Bran. That’s it. No logic or depth to it.➴ The minimal character development. Characters contradict their own statements and beliefs all the time. Robinhood should have been a grey character, given the intent expressed in the author’s note, but he turns out to be mostly dark and manipulative. Jane is naïve and wilful, and seems to be more dominated by her lust than by her mind. It is weird how Jane suddenly knows Robinhood better than all the men who've been with him for far longer. Robin’s not-so-merry men also have an appearance in this book, with most of them not having well-sketched portrayals. ➴ Thanks to the above, the connection between the characters never feels organic. We see them having feelings for each other, but never understand the hows and whys. The relationships hence feel surface-level. Jane’s attraction towards Robinhood is the least convincing. ➴ The dialogues are somewhat movie-like in their extravagance, making the book feel like a screenplay at times. This might be entertaining for some readers, but the unrealistic tone of the conversations pulled me out of the narrative. It’s annoying to see historical characters use interjections such as “Shit!”, “My arse!” or the F word. There are a few other anachronistic phrases such as someone “having a tell.” This negated the effect of the few instances where genuine medieval spellings have been used, which I had appreciated. ➴ I didn’t expect a strong literary feel anyway from such a plotline, but I did expect a stronger historical feel. There IS historical content but the characters’ thoughts and actions feel more modern. (Not 21st-century-modern, but definitely not 12-13th century.) The least convincing is the idea of Jane and a couple of other ladies spouting modern feminist thoughts about women’s emancipation and freedom of choice. Hah! All in all, I had expected to love this book, especially as a lover of historical fiction and atypical retellings. However the overall book reads like a YA work (except for the adult content such as cuss words, lewd thoughts, and gruesome action.) It’s very lightweight as a historical novel. I cannot deny the potential of this idea of showing the negative shades of Robinhood’s character, but the execution leaves much to be desired. This is the author’s debut novel, and her prior works have been scholarly nonfiction. A part of me feels like this book too would have worked better as a nonfiction, offering us the truth about Robinhood’s character as portrayed in the medieval ballads, and cutting out the ignorant Jane as the narrator. As a historical fiction, it just doesn’t hit the bullseye.I’m not sure whom to recommend this to as it was a below-average experience for me. However, no two readers read the same book. Perhaps this might work better for readers who don’t read historical fiction often and are open to a novel view into the medieval hero’s life. 1.5 stars.My thanks to Penguin Group - Viking for providing the DRC of “The Traitor of Sherwood Forest” via NetGalley.

 ||","4 StarsFirst off, thank you to the publisher and author for the ARC in exchange for my honest review.This book is a refreshing take on the Robin Hood legend, nestled among a sea of Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and other familiar retellings. And I must say, it was beautiful. I love how everything unfolded. Jane, the FMC, was naive, but not in a way that made her irritating. She was clever, just learning and growing in her own way. Robin, on the other hand, was a character I both loved and hated, in the best way possible. He felt so human—flawed, complex, and unpredictable.The side characters were a delightful addition to the story, each one adding something special to the narrative, and the ending… oh, the ending! It wrapped everything up perfectly, leaving me beyond satisfied. There was a warmth to this book that stayed with me from start to finish. The entire journey felt like being enchanted in the best possible way.This book has that comforting vibe I crave, with the perfect blend of emotional depth and rich character development. It’s the kind of story that lingers with you long after you've closed the pages.","જ⁀➴ 2 starsThank you to NetGalley, Amy S.

Long Island,Colm Tóibín,3.73,"What a disappointment. The Kirkus starred review describes, ""a dramatic denouement,"" with ""a plot twist worthy of Edith Wharton."" To me it felt like the last page of the book must be missing, or that the author, unsure how the end the book simply decided not to.",This is a weirdly sterile and passionless novel where none of the characters express emotion. The reader is at a loss for where to cast his sympathies and interest.,"4.5⭐️Long Island by Colm Tóibín continues with the story of Eilis Lacey, our protagonist from Brooklyn . Set twenty years after the events of the first novel, Eilis, now in her forties, is the wife of Italian plumber Tony Fiorelli, whom we met in the first book. Parents to two teenagers, daughter Rossella and sixteen-year-old son Larry they have settled in Long Island in a cul-de-sac with Tony’s parents and two of her husband’s three brothers and their families as neighbors. Despite being a close-knit family and Eilis sharing a good relationship with everybody, she is conscious of how different she is from her close-knit extended family. The differences become more pronounced when Tony’s actions push their marriage into a downward spiral, and she feels his family isn’t supportive of her or her wishes. Eilis hasn’t been back to Ireland in twenty years, but feeling the need to distance herself from Tony and his family, decides to visit her mother who will soon turn eighty, with her children to join her later. As the narrative progresses, this time we follow Eilis as she revisits her hometown and those she had left behind when she chose to return to Tony all those years ago. Conflicted over her feelings for Tony, her responsibilities to children and the future she desires for herself, she is compelled to take stock of her life and reflect on her regrets and the consequences of her life choices. Unprepared for the onslaught of emotions and complexities that arise when confronted with her past, she finds herself once again at a crossroads in life.Long Island by Colm Tóibín is an exquisitely penned novel that had me hooked until the very last page. The narrative is shared from the perspectives of Eilis and two other characters from her past in Ireland- her best friend Nancy and Jim Farrell with whom she once shared a romantic relationship, both of whom we had met in the previous book. Compared to the first book this is a more complex and layered novel and the author seamlessly weaves the three perspectives into an immersive, consistently paced narrative that revolves around love, family, secrets, choices and consequences. Not only do we get to follow Eilis’s journey but we are also provided insight into how her mother, brothers and friends have fared in the last twenty years and how her presence impacts them in the present day. The strength of this novel lies in its mature and realistic depiction of complex human emotions and relationships with minimal melodrama and concise yet elegant prose – be it the tensions between Eilis and Tony or Eilis and her mother, the complexities that arise between Nancy, Jim and Eilis or how Eilis’s children react to their troubled marriage. Though her children had never shown any interest in their Irish heritage, it was endearing to see them absorb as much as they could in the course of their visit and bond with their grandmother whom they were meeting for the first time and who welcomed them with open arms. I particularly liked how the author addresses the cracks in the relationship between Eilis and her mother. The Eilis we meet in this book is mature and complex. Though I could sympathize with her predicament with Tony and admired her inner strength and resolve, I couldn’t help but question some of her actions in the latter half of the story. The ending leaves us with more than a few unanswered questions and leaves me eager to explore Eilis's motivations further. I would recommend reading the previous novel before picking up the sequel for a better understanding of Eilis’s journey and the events referenced in this novel.To be honest, I did not think that Brooklyn needed a sequel, but the ending of  Long Island has me eagerly awaiting the next chapter in Eilis’s life.Many thanks to Scribner for the digital review copy via NetGalley.

The Last Hope,Susan Elia MacNeal,4.11,"The Last Hope
 by Susan Elia MacNeal is the eleventh and final book in the Maggie Hope historical mystery series. Maggie Hope has had numerous jobs including secretary to Winston Churchill, a defuser of bombs that were dropped in London by the Germans, but had not exploded, and currently, a spy. In this one Maggie is sent to Madrid, Spain, with a few stops along the way. She has two parts to this mission. The first part is to meet with fashion designer and possible double agent Coco Chanel. The second task is to assassinate a German physicist, Werner Heisenberg. Meanwhile there are events and revelations occurring in Maggie’s personal life. The events occur in 1944.The characterization is well done. Maggie is a mathematics major, enjoys recognizing patterns, word games, and puzzles. She’s also been trained as a spy, is a skilled marksman, and has a complicated personal and family life. Her internal conflicts felt realistic and appropriate.The writing is well-done, the plot is engaging and thought-provoking, as well as heart-wrenching during at least one scene. It was interesting to get insight into the somewhat neutral countries and life within them. Several strong themes run through this novel including the horrors of war, betrayals, spies, collaboration, assassinations, double agents, blackmail, guilt, propaganda, and much more. Overall, this novel is entertaining and moving. It’s a strong and impactful tale with plenty of action and suspense. I feel like this series is best read in series order. The back-story will enhance a reader’s enjoyment and understanding as the series progresses. Readers who enjoy historical mysteries and espionage novels will likely enjoy this book. Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine – Bantam and Susan Elia MacNeal provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via Net Galley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. Publication date is currently set for May 21 2024.-----------------------------------------My 4.02 rounded to 4 stars review is coming soon.","So....... I'm really pissed right now. Those of us that have read the entire series, waited almost three years for this book to come out, and it just ends :( The book was well researched but did drag in a couple of places and there's no sense of finality.Books 1-8 came out in a quick succession. No cliff hangers. Then comes book 9; a great book. This ends with the teaser John Sterlings coming back. All of us who love John are so excited and like 'it's about time, he came back into the picture.' We get to wait almost a year and a half for 10 to come out, which ends on the cliff hanger, this last mission is their last and most dangerous and will Maggie and John get back together and finally marry? We as the fans invested hours, into these books, pouring over them, research some of the names of the players. I feel like I was so excited for this book, only to be terribly let down.**** Ms. MacNeal, responded to my rant! Fret not Maggie Hope fans, there is hopefully (No pun Intended) something in the works!!!!!!*********","An explosive finale to a thrilling series! Once again, Maggie Hope shines as she finds herself plunged into a dangerous game of intrigue in World War 2 Spain. With spies, double agents, and shady figures around every corner, readers won’t be able to resist losing themselves in each thrilling twist and turn!"
All the Colors of the Dark,Chris  Whitaker,4.28,"In a Nutshell: A literary saga spanning multiple genres and decades. It's not just the story of a tragedy but also of what happens after a tragedy. Will work better if you know what to expect. It isn’t a traditional mystery-thriller, so better if read as a slooooowwwwww character-driven drama. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview: 1975. Monta Clare, Missouri. Patch is a one-eyed teenager who considers himself a good pirate. His only friend is the whimsical thirteen-year-old Saint, who lives with her grandmother. In their small town where everyone knows everyone else, Patch and Saint think they have their future paths clear. All changes when a mysterious man attacks Misty, the only daughter of a wealthy family. Patch emerges as an unlikely hero in this situation, but the life trajectory of the people involved changes forever as a result. Spanning many decades and genres, the story comes to us from the limited third-person perspectives of the key characters.Imagine this. You are visiting a tourist place that you have heard some good feedback about. You hire a tourist guide who promises to take you to your destination, but instead of leading you there directly, the guide makes you roam around myriad other places, telling you detailed stories of each of them. Most of his tales are interesting, but after a point, you wonder why he is traversing a circuitous route when all you wanted to go to was the destination promised at the start. Finally, after a long and somewhat frustrating journey, you reach your destination, and it turns out to be everything you hoped for. But as much as the joy of discovery is, you can’t help having mixed feelings about the rest of the day: yes, you gained insight about many other spots, but you also feel a bit irked at the amount of time it took to visit what wasn’t even on the agenda. It’s not like you didn’t enjoy the unplanned circumambulatory route full of surprises, but you wish you had been better prepared for it beforehand.That’s me with this book. I was prepared for a mystery-thriller, but I got a slow-paced literary fiction. While I can often recalibrate my reading sensor according to the writing approach, it failed this time.Bookish Yays:😍 The main characters: Saint & Patch. Well-sketched, complex, grey, human.😍 Patch’s being one-eyed, and this trait being turned into an intricate part of his persona than making it a disability popping in at random intervals.😍 An excellent start and a great ending.😍 Evocative writing, with plenty of quotable quotes and lines to ponder upon.😍 Superb use of the mountain setting of small-town Missouri, with great descriptions that don’t overshadow the plot. 😍 A unusual approach to a mystery, focussing on myriad obsessions of varied characters. This could also be called a love story sans romance. 😍 Enough of twists and turns to keep you going on. You will not be able to predict the direction of most of the plot.😍 Though there are many crimes that occur in the book, the content never gets graphic. Love it when authors don’t let gore do the talking. Bookish Mixed Bags:😐 As this is tagged as a mystery-thriller, I went in hoping for a steady-paced, thrill-inducing, mystery. But while there is a mystery in the book, it is not the prime focus of the plot, which is quite character-oriented, and stresses more on the lives of the people affected by the crime than on the crime itself. This definitely would have worked better for me had I been mentally prepared for a literary drama than for a crime thriller.😐 The middle chunk of the book drags. A LOT! Had I been a willing DNFer, I might have even quit on the book at this point. But thankfully I didn’t as the ending was worth the wait. Either the middle section should have been tightened or this should have been marked as a character-driven literary work so that readers would know what to expect. (Especially those of us who haven’t read this author before and went in blind.)😐 There are many side plots detracting from the core mystery. While these are intricately layered and well written, the fact is that I wanted to see the mystery resolved than to know more about other irrelevant things.Bookish Nays:😕 The story spans decades. Though there are years marked at the start of a few chapters, it is confusing at times to remember how old the characters are at that point. Patch’s age isn’t clarified at all (as far as I can remember; hope I didn’t miss any reference), so I just assumed him to be the same age as Misty. There are pop culture references to help out, but these would work only if you know the approximate period to which the references belonged.[Editing to Clarify: The age complaint is not valid anymore. Evidently, it is mentioned right at the start of this 600-page long journey. I missed it! If you too are in the same boat, know that Patch, Saint, and Misty all are thirteen at the start of the story. Thanks to those who helped with this info in the comments!] 😕 This book has 261 short chapters, with some of the chapters being hardly a couple of pages long. I know there are readers who like short chapters, but this was too many for my liking.😕 The pacing is quite erratic, going from rushed at the start, to almost zero in between, to fast again at the end. In a 580+ page book, I’d have appreciated a more consistent tempo.My reading experience of this novel reminded me of how I felt on reading  Donna Tartt’s 'The Goldfinch' - yet another magnum opus that begins with a mystery but takes ages to be resolved. In both cases, I liked the journey, but I was more relieved than exhilarated to reach the end.This is my first book by this acclaimed author, so I shall be better prepared for a literary approach the next time I pick up his work. Mine is a slight outlier review. Most other reviews of this book are gushy 5 stars, so perhaps it was only my erroneous expectations courtesy that dratted “thriller” tag that caused my experience to go awry. I still recommend this strongly, but to literary fiction lovers who enjoy the artistic nuances of storytelling and character development. If you want a fast-paced mystery-thriller, pick something else.3.5 stars. (I debated a long time over whether to round this up or down. The writing is beautiful enough to merit a 4 stars, but this rating would not be indicative of my frustration while reading it. Hence rounding downwards.)My thanks to Crown Publishing and NetGalley for the DRC of “All the Colors of the Dark”.

 ||","Umm...Did I read the same book as everyone else? This one took me FOREVER, and I just kept reading, hoping some brilliance would pop up so that I could forgive all of the bad that came before. That never happened. In fact, the end of the book made me so angry that I even bothered to finish. To begin, my dude needs an editor. Immediately. This book could have been half the length, easily. The entire middle was full of a muddled, messy, confusing, meandering path full of ""clues"" that were nonsensical and never amounted to anything other than the ramblings of a girl who may or may not be a figment of the main character's imagination. The entire ""mystery"" of the book (is Grace real?) is strung out the entire time, and then, at the end..does not matter. I could probably rant for days about how the overwrought, pretentious sentence fragments scattered throughout the book often made no damn sense.I have degrees in English and Literacy. I teach Language Arts. I genuinely had to look up the rules on prepositional phrases because I felt like some monumental shift that I was unaware of must have taken place (nope). So many ""sentences"" did not even meet the most basic grammatical standards (subject verb object, anyone?). I got so mad about this that I started asking anyone around me to read specific lines and make sense of them. Spoiler alert: they couldn't.This one sentence made me so irritated that I almost rage quit: ""Patch sought a stream that shone like polished glass shattered over rocks that humped from the bed so sandpipers had a spot to fish from.""What does that even mean?!Verb tenses shifted incomprehensibly. Chapters began with only pronouns and no names, which meant that I had to constantly seek out clues as to who I was reading about at any given time. The ONLY thing that made me feel better about being grammatically gaslit through the entire book was the author's endnote, in which he admits that he is terrible at grammar *dramatic inhale.*All that aside, the story itself is just... a mess. It has too many moving parts. There are too many characters, too many pieces that I was supposed to care about, but I just did not. The story felt cheesy, ridiculous, over the top, and honestly, kind of derivative of a lot of better stories. It reminded me of Stand by Me mixed with The Notebook mixed with The Shawshank Redemption. Doesn't that sound crazy? Good. Now, throw in some pirates and abortion/adoption stories for extra fun, and you have this book that tops countless best-of-2024 lists, and that made me feel incomprehensible amounts of literary rage. 🙃","One of the best books I've read in a long time.It’s hard to know what to say about this book because it’s about so many things, but I knew hardly anything about it going in. I can rehash the blurb-- that it's a mystery/thriller spanning several decades --but that tells you nothing about why this book is so powerful. It doesn’t tell you all the little things that make it: the strength of the characters, the humour to offer light through the dark themes, the many surprises waiting to be uncovered.All the Colors of the Dark is a story of trauma and obsession. The blurb mentions a love story, but the truth is this book contains several love stories, not all of them romantic. It is one of those books where I read it desperate to find out the truth, searching for closure with a need to know, and absolutely afraid of what I’d find.The characters are truly well-drawn and memorable. Not just the protagonists, but all the side characters too. And it just has so much to say. We follow these complex characters through their lives as they chase answers to a mystery that seems to get colder by the day, but alongside this are powerful stories of love, friendship and loyalty. I cared so very much.Plus, I recently complained about thrillers that rest on ludicrous twists and this book was a perfect example of how to get it right. It contains the kind of twists and turns I love. Not some ridiculous “oh that character is actually this character and that man you thought was long-dead is actually your new mother-in-law” but thoughtful, layered discoveries. Finding out what happened in this book is a gradual peeling away of layers.Also, I feel like authors who write lovely short chapters like this are angels.The book contains lots of dark themes that won't be suitable for everyone, including domestic and sexual abuse, and references to abortion, but there's plenty of colour in the dark (I'm so sorry, I just can't help myself.) So did I love this book? Entirely and absolutely."
The Frozen River,Ariel Lawhon,4.40,"The Frozen River is an example of historical fiction at its finest. I love books that not only educate me but evoke emotion and are thought provoking. This book did all three perfectly. The Frozen River was inspired by Martha Ballard (February 9, 1735 – June 9, 1812), a midwife who delivered hundreds of babies and kept diaries about her personal life as well as her experiences as a midwife. Her diaries have proven to be educational and provided insight into the lives of women during her time/life. I loved how the author blended fact and fiction to bring this book to life. I loved this gripping, and hard to put down historical mystery that had me turning the pages and wanting to know whodunit.Maine, 1789 After successfully delivering a baby, Martha Ballard is summoned to examine the body of a man who has been found in the frozen Kennebec River. She makes her observations and determines that the man has been murdered. Martha's husband taught her to read and write and she maintains a diary where she keeps track of births, deaths, when she has provided healing and aspects of her personal life. She notes what she has observed when examining the dead man's body. The dead man just happens to be one of the men who has been accused of raping a woman several months earlier. When a trial date for the rape is set, Martha will be called as a witness, and her diary will be shown as evidence.Over the course of the winter, Martha will deliver many babies and come up against, Dr. Benjamin Page, a Harvard educated doctor, who not only disagrees with her pertaining to how the man found in the river died, but also disagrees with her when it comes to childbirth. Man did he agitate me as he did Martha in the story. There was a lot of booing and hissing from me during his scenes. I was completely and blissfully hooked from the very first page! I admired Martha's courage, her gumption, her intellect, her straightforward approach, her advocating for women and her healing knowledge. She lived in a time where many women could not read or write. As a midwife she could testify in court for certain things but for the rape trial could only testify if her husband was present. This book also highlighted how women were treated during this time. Women could be tried for having a child out of wedlock due to fornicating, but the men involved walked around with their reputation intact. After all, it's her fault he got under her skirts. Grrr. I couldn't help but feel for the women of this book. I was invested in the mystery as to how the man got into the river just as much as I was invested in Martha's life. I was happy she had a loving marriage with a man who respected not only her but her skills and always had her back. There were many characters in this book, each is distinct and played a part. As with most books, there were characters I loved, those I liked and there were characters that I loathed. I loved the vivid descriptions, the chilling atmosphere, and the tension in this wonderful book. I could tell that the author did a tremendous amount of research prior to writing The Frozen River. I was glued to the pages of this beautifully written book. I love how Martha was assertive, outspoken, confident and a champion for women in a time when women were not considered equal. The author's note at the end is also a must-read section of the book.
Gripping, thought provoking, atmospheric, tense and beautifully written.
Highly Recommend.#TheFrozenRiver #NetGalley. #ArielLawhon #DoubledayBooksThank you to Doubleday Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com","4.5 - This one took me almost the whole month to finish, but definitely worth it! Love a historical fiction and this one was inspired by the real Martha Ballard’s life and being a midwife in the 1700’s. Listened to about 90% of it and just finished the last 60-ish pages and it was just so good. You HAVE to read the Author’s Note!!!!","Preaching much??🙄It is 1789. A body is found frozen in the Kennebec river in Maine. The midwife, Martha Ballard who is called to determine the cause of death, is sure the victim was murdered, but her findings are rejected by the local doctor who writes off the cause of death as accident. Moreover, it turns out that the victim was one of the men who were accused of raping the local minister’s wife. Was the deceased murdered? And if so, who is the murderer?Well, our Martha is determined to discover the truth.Reasons for my 2 stars:-The book could have been much shorter. It was long and slower than a lame snail.-I didn’t like Martha. In fact I hated her. Martha is a kind of woman you would want to avoid. She is one of those controlling people, who would push you do things you don’t want to. She would meddle in your affairs and would bad-mouth your husband in front of you, and would expect you to agree with her, because if you don’t, you would be labeled weak.-There wasn’t one character in the book she didn’t judge. She was condescending and irritating. In her view all the men were either devils incarnate or idiots (except her own husband) and the women were dumb and weak or extremely clever.-I am a woman and even I was offended by her ‘feminist’ behavior, which brings me to the way she talked, which sounded more like a woman from the year 2024 talking/ranting, than someone from the year 1789. In fact most of the time I kept forgetting that she wasn’t from the 21st century.-Apparently everybody and their uncle in that town is pregnant or has become pregnant out of wedlock."
The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue,V.E. Schwab,4.17,"ARC provided by Tor in exchange for an honest review. 


""Stories come in so many forms: in charcoal, and in song, in paintings, poems, films. And books.""



This is a book about a girl, a boy, a devil, and the stories that get told and repeated and remembered. This is a tale of power dynamics and imbalances and what humans are willing to do to not feel trapped and alone. This is all about a young girl who lives her life for herself, who lives her life in spite of the odds, who lives her life in hopes someone will recall her from memory.Everything about Addie LaRue completely blew me away. This is the first book by V.E. Schwab that I’ve given five stars to, and I’m not sure a day has passed since reading that I haven’t thought about it. I will say that I think this book (and more importantly the ending) could be a bit polarizing, but this story, this main character, and the way everything was structured just really worked perfectly for me and my reading tastes.How do I even begin to describe this book to you? There are truly so many layers woven together to make this story. Many of you know, this is something that V.E. Schwab has been working on for a decade and you can tell they really put their whole heart and soul into these complex characters:➽ Addie - A girl with seven freckles, and she is told that there is one for every love she would ever have. She was born in a small town, and had small town expectations placed on her, but Addie had big dreams and desired to see as much of the world as she possibly could. And when she turns twenty-three, and everyone thinks her time is slowly running out, she quickly finds out that time is something she will never have to fear again.


""Spells are for the witches, and witches are too often burned.""


➽ Henry - Works at a bookstore in New York while trying to live his life to the fullest. And he happens to be able to see a girl that has never been remembered before.


""I remember you.""


➽ Luc - A god you should never pray to after dark, unless you are very desperate, and feel very helpless, and are willing to pay the unknown price.


""I am stronger than your god and older than your devil. I am the darkness between stars, and the roots beneath the earth. I am promise, and potential, and when it comes to playing games, I divine the rules, I set the pieces, and I choose when to play. And tonight, I say no.""


And maybe, just maybe, Addie felt like she should be able to pay the price when she runs into the forest one night, willing to risk everything to have a life that is hers once and for all. We get to see Addie and her struggles and her growth over the course of three-hundred-years, starting in 1714 France and switching to 2014 America. We get to see so much of Addie’s hurt throughout the centuries, but we also get to see so much of her yearning. Yearning for love, yearning for knowledge, yearning for art, yearning for a life that is worthy of remembrance. Truly, this book was able to evoke such visceral reactions from me, and I could truly feel Addie’s yearning, and her hurt, on every page.Now that I have used the word “yearning” one-hundred times, let’s talk about some of the rep in Addie LaRue, because there are lots of queer characters and characters who read queer! Addie is pan or bi, and we get to see her in relationships with different genders throughout this book, but the main relationship (and yearning) is m/f. I believe Henry is pan, but it is never said on page, but ""he’s attracted to a person first and their gender second"" had me and my pan heart ascending to new heights, I promise you that. Addie and Henry are both white, but there are POC side characters and other identities on the LGBTQIAP+ spectrum (gay, lesbian, maybe some polyamorous hints)! And this book, has some very serious depression representation!

Being unsure what you want in life. Especially in your twenties. Feeling like something is wrong with you. Feeling like you’ll never be enough. Feeling like you’ll never be whole. Feeling like you are just disappointing everyone around you. Feeling like no one will ever take the time to see you, the real you, and choose to love you unconditionally anyways. Whew, it’s a lot, and V.E. Schwab really didn’t hold back while writing Henry and his mental health. I don’t want to make this too personal, but it means a lot to me, and I know Henry’s journey is going to mean a lot to so many people and impact a lot of lives.(Also, friendly reminder that life is truly a vast range of up and down journeys! And you, and your journey, are valid, and I see you no matter how hard that journey feels at times. There will be lots of heavy days, but lots of light days too, I promise. And you are so worthy of love, and kindness, and respect, no matter where you are at on your journey. And feeling too much is not a curse, ever. And I’m proud of you, and you are never alone with what you are feeling, and sometimes we all need help with some storms: http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org)


""His heart has a draft. It lets in light. It lets in storms. It lets in everything.""


Plus, a key component of this story is the god who Addie makes a deal with. Addie and Luc’s three-hundred-year bargain is so very messy and has so very many different elements. But the key element is the unhealthy power dynamic. Over this course of time, we get to see their relationship change, and morph, and grow, and we get to see Addie desperately trying to gain some of the power for herself. But, it is a very unhealthy cycle of abuse and this story is told in a way where the reader gets to see these power imbalances come more and more into play and Luc and Addie set the stage of their game(s) more and more. I’ll be the first to say I always wanted more of Luc, and I loved every chapter he was in, and I constantly wanted to know more about him, but I will also say that I personally feel like V.E. Schwab was very deliberate with his character and with making him charming and intriguing and a character to be romanticized, because abusers can have all of those characteristics and still be abusers.But we get to see Luc, and Henry, and Addie, and watch their intertangled stories unwind. I truly feel like I can’t say much more about the actual story, and I believe it’s probably best to not know much more than what I’ve said above, but seeing these characters, during all their different phases in life, both alone and together, is truly something like a work of art.


""Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.""


This entire story truly is a love letter to art and the beautiful, awe inspiring, mind-blowing way stories are held within art, therefore held in so many hearts forever. Maybe even creating and inspiring other art, to make the sweetest ripple effect of them all. Art and stories are so powerful because they have the power to heal wounds that are too deep to be touched by other things. From feeling love, to feeling not alone, to inspiring, to escape, to be thought provoking, to be educational, to make you realize things you have been forced to internalize and unlearn, to something as simple yet as hard as happiness.


""Because time is cruel to all, and crueler still to artists. Because vision weakens, and voices wither, and talent fades. "" He leans close, twists a lock of her hair around one finger. ""Because happiness is brief, and history is lasting, and in the end, "" he says, ""everyone wants to be remembered.""


While I was reading this book, me and my best friend Lea watched a video that was reuploaded on V.E.’s YouTube. It was basically just an hour-long discussion that they had with Tessa Gratton, where they talk about many things, but one of the things they talked about that I especially haven’t been able to stop thinking about since finishing this book was that we never get to really pick what work we will be known for. Obviously, Victoria is very well-know from their series A Darker Shade of Magic, and it very well could be the greatest legacy that the world will know from them. Yet, they talk about how Addie LaRue is the book of their heart, and (I do not want to put any words in their mouth) it kind of felt like to me the book they may want the world to know them for. Yet, we never really get to choose what we are known for, do we? A very astounding concept to think about, truly, and one I couldn’t stop feeling deeply in my bones while I finished the last half of this book. Also, to think about how the human experiences could boil down to this hunger we all have to leave a mark on this world before we are forced to leave it all together? Very powerful stuff, truly. But I promise, V.E. Schwab and Addie Larue most definitely left their marks on me, and my heart, forever with this book.






""Humans are capable of such wondrous things. Of cruelty, and war, but also art and invention.""


Overall, this book made me yearn for so many things while also constantly making me question what it is to hunger. To crave your freedom, to crave someone who will see all the parts of you, to crave remembrance. I just feel like this book really touched on the human experience, but in such a incredibly raw and indistinguishably beautiful way. I really loved The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and it will without a doubt make my best of 2020 list. Thank you for letting me be a part of your story, thank you for always reading this part of mine, and I promise you will never be invisible to me.Youtube | Instagram | Twitter | Blog | Spotify | Twitch Trigger and Content Warnings: attempted assault, abuse depiction, loss of a loved one, substance abuse, depression depiction, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, and mention of cancer in the past.

What is a person, if not the marks they leave behind?
They say if you look through a wooden ring on the 29th night of July, just after dark, you’d see a wraith wandering valleys and alleys—singing, sighing, seeking. And if you lean in, shell of an ear pressed to the ring, you would hear the echoes of a madwoman, murmuring of a dance of three centuries, a game between the ruler of darkness and a ghost of a girl, a war that was a love affair and a need and an obsession.They say that, if you follow closely, she’d take you through continents and centuries—chasing shadows, stalking the vanishing footsteps of an idea, a touch, a constellation of seven freckles. And if you stack up your courage in a fist and ask her what it is she seeks, she would tell you it is a god and a girl, a forgotten thing. And then she would turn to the night and cry out in challenge and raging prayer.This, my friend, is where I suggest you let your fist fly open, scattering the gathered grains, and flee. For if you don’t, you would glimpse a man with raven hair and a fleeting emerald labyrinth for eyes set in the face of a wolf step from the shadows, a dark god bearing his own temples of need and desperation. For if you stay, the devil would take your soul.They say, and they say it honest and true.I would know—I am the wraith, after all.
“No matter how desperate or dire, never pray to the gods that answer after dark.”
This quiet, languid, fleeting, wandering, aromantic romance that is more need and companionship than love; this tale of immortality with its heartwrenching wail and tragic tale of watching all you hold on to fall apart in your grasp; this book of a bewitching affair and search for freedom, love, and remembrance; this book with its ingenuous creativity, dwelling on the power of belief and ideas...stole my heart, bled it dry, and speared it atop the gates of hell to warn the unwary what would happen if you fell in love with the devil.I persistently urge you to listen to the unbelievably flawless and fitting songs on my playlist of this book ➾ Spotify URL
“Nothing is all good or all bad,” she says. “Life is so much messier than that.”And there in the dark, he asks if it was really worth it.Were the instants of joy worth the stretches of sorrow?Were the moments of beauty worth the years of pain?And she turns her head, and looks at him, and says, “Always.”
In honour of Addie’s seven-star constellation of freckles, the feature that ensnared gazes and inspired artists and shone through centuries, I’m assigning each of the seven main stars of the Orion to the seven whys The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue is a haunting, blinding, bold sky:

★ Rigel: Storytelling

I would like to announce that I am the biggest idiot on earth for depriving myself of the writing of such a master storyteller. Such exceptional weaving techniques of piecing the tale together as a puzzle; such eloquent work, bringing the pages and words full circle; such perfect prose with sensible, tangible, and fitting metaphors.Such talent. Much perfection.
What she needs are stories.Stories are a way to preserve one’s self. To be remembered. And to forget.Stories come in so many forms: in charcoal, and in song, in paintings, poems, films. And books.Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.
From sculpting characters that are more than a sculpture, real as any person with various outlooks on life that indeed leak into their way of speech, to scrutiny of details, wiping away any possible logical holes in the plot or magic, I am going to call V.E. Schwab my new all-time fave author even though this is my first book of hers. Let me just fold up my sleeves and get into the process of devouring the rest of her works.

★ Bellatrix: Addie LaRue, the Muse

Scarier than having a dream, a desire, a need, and making a huge mistake because of it, haunted by your blindness for 3 centuries, is watching it happen and thinking that could be me.It’s the relief of understanding towards an unrestrained, wild thing in search of her freedom, her life, her own path—be it companionship or loneliness; it’s the warmth of kinship towards a defiant dreamer dreaming of a stranger with dark hair, crying out against the night to belong to no one but herself, be bound to none but herself; and it’s the resignation to a road undoubtedly ahead of a girl fleeing the smallness of a static life, a tomb, strings cut, head wandering.It’s joy and it’s pain and it’s unforgettable.Addie LaRue is unforgettable.

★ Betelgeuse: Love & Luc, the Devil

Before I talk of Luc and love, I will—in true self-centred-me fashion—talk about me. So buckle up for personal information you absolutely did not ask for.# confession timeI’ve always believed myself a loveless creature. I’ve believed it and declared it, to friend, family, stranger. Strangers raise an eyebrow, family nods in understanding of a shared problem, but friends...friends always disagree, always start a speech about how kind and caring and helpful and generous I am, well-intendedly attempting to explain myself to me as if I don’t live in my head.What those friends do not understand is the meaning of love. Frankly, I was not sure of it either other than knowing I am not capable of it. That is, until Schwab wrote:
“You are not capable of love because you cannot understand what it is to care for someone else more than yourself.”
Love comes with honesty and compassion and trust and understanding, yes, but, above all else, love is putting someone else before yourself. And I admit I cannot truly love because I know that, no matter how giving and caring and helpful I am, I will always choose me if choosing others hurts me, and the fact that I do not care for most things so I wouldn’t be hurt by them (like money) does not take away from my being an essentially selfish creature. I confess this without any sugar coating because I believe it’s crucial to know your most prominent flaws and be honest with yourself and those around you, to refrain from harming others through them.That’s love. So what about Luc?
“Pain can be beautiful,” he says, exhaling a cloud of smoke. “It can transform. It can create.”
My uncalled for rant above makes it glaringly—blindingly, really, because if you didn’t get it then seriously whatareyoudoin—obvious I relate to this god of the dark between the stars; this selfish and lonely creature with secret longings and hidden loss; this cruel, moody immortal seeing the world as a game but also capable of being wounded and confused; this “vast and savage night, the darkness, full of promise, and violence, fear, and freedom” with a lack of respect for boundaries.
“Do not mistake this—any of it—for kindness, Adeline.” His eyes go bright with mischief. “I simply want to be the one who breaks you.”
But beyond being relatable, he is possessive, obsessive, abusive, and other unattractive -ives. And this plus Addie’s unwillingness to ever back down is what makes their bloodsport of a dynamic so utterly irresistible—one that, despite its toxicity (that is never overlooked or romanticised), has its perks (how he pushes her, challenges her, to be better, if ruthlessly) and hilarious moments (how he ruins her dates, even as he’s a god for god’s sake).But remember that, no matter how these two cutthroats fit, no matter how their passionate, warlike back-and-forths are something they both crave, she only really had him in the vast emptiness of her world, and he made it so. Her thoughts are filled with him, because he made it so.Remember that, however alluring their affair, it is not love.

★ Alnilam: Henry, the Storykeeper

You know that feeling when you get gifted a box of sweets and you think well okay this will probably be cloyingly sweet and ah, well, I will end up tired of it and then you have a taste and oh will you never forget the moment it sizzled on your tongue and you realised no no it is not more of the same and it’s simply unique?That’s Henry for me.Because sensitive, caring, soft, quiet, strong characters haunted by failure more often than not fail to hold my flickering attention, yet I now trust Victoria Schwab to do the unlikely. Because he is more than those adjectives strung up together; he is lost and hungry in a world that holds an insurmountable number of tastes, insatiably craving too many of them to choose; he is a boy who sees stories in theology, who fears being himself as much as he hates not being seen as himself; and he is more than simply sensitive, carrying a cracked heart that lets in everything and anything, and Schwab’s exploration of his mental health and anxiety was soulful and unforgettable.

★ Alnitak: Feminism

Sometimes I wonder if, through the millennia that humans have roamed the earth, there has ever been a girl who has not looked away, looked up, from what life had handed her, seen the lot of boy next to her and wanted more. I wonder if, even among the content and kind and incurious of generations ago where being a dreamer was not yet a seed planted, not a one of them dreamt of freedom and ownership of one’s own life.And mostly, I wonder if the women who called after questioning girls as one would a sheep gone astray, are in reality the ones who’d seen the most injustice, dreamt the hardest, and learned such a hard lesson to end up helping in the keeping of the leash.
Freedom is a pair of trousers and a buttoned coat. A man’s tunic and a tricorne hat. If only she had known. The darkness claimed he’d given her freedom, but really, there is no such thing for a woman, not in a world where they are bound up inside their clothes, and sealed inside their homes, a world where only men are given leave to roam.
I might never know, but I will always seek tales of dreamers who would look at men and see at what little cost they moved through life, who would look into the woods and ask to be a tree, grown wild rather than pruned and cut down to burn in someone else’s hearth, be someone else’s chair.Addie LaRue’s is one such tale.

★ Mintaka: History & Art

For a book that spans across hundreds of years and yards, it goes without saying that there will be history and humanity with all its wonders and cruelty and war and art. And yet, as Addie would put it, “history is a thing designed in retrospect” and Addie LaRue is less a lesson on history than a parable of a great many presents.
“Art is about ideas. And ideas are wilder than memories. They’re like weeds, always finding their way up.”
So while there is history with clever commentary on evolution of fashion and glimpses of war and death and revolution, that is not what it is about. Schwab’s new novel is about history taking shape. About stories and ideas taking root in unseen places and climbing up through the darkest places of mind that have never seen the sunlight. Not about the world-changing historical figures and world-ending historical events written as a hammer falling, but as a friend and a brief conversation and a flash of life. This is not about the affect of the grand but the power of the minor.It’s about life and art and humans and how, even after one hundred years or three hundred years, there is yet more to find. Unknowns to see. Novelties to discover. And it is all the more memorable because of it.

★ Saiph: Loneliness & Remembrance

Have you ever watched that glorious, solitary tree of decades and centuries and memories struck down by a lightning storm? Ever held that tiny, inconsequential keepsake of a forgotten soul, refusing to ease your desperate grasp? Have you spent hours and days and a lifetime breathing your heart and soul and life into that lifeless thing, shaping it with your will and need and then, just a blink too soon, a moment before perfection, resolution, completion, seen it fall apart?Tell me, have you ever felt that abyss of sadness reserved for the lost? The forgotten? The lonely?
“Why would anyone trade a lifetime of talent for a few years of glory?”“Because happiness is brief, and history is lasting, and in the end,” he says, “everyone wants to be remembered.”
I am a creature doomed to loneliness, seeking its banishment and knowing it is here to stay, and this book is the song of my soul. Because this, this is the why behind the exquisite pain of this book: a loss so stark, so sharp it cut straight through me and I poured, I poured until I drowned and I poured until all was washed away and there, right there—beneath the pain and the dirt and the injustice—there lay the gem of names and marks fading into darkness; of identity and reality with its bittersweet embrace; of dreams and time slipping through your clutching hands; of me, and you, and humanity’s unending need to be remembered and chased and never replaced.
“The vexing thing about time,” he says, “is that it’s never enough. Perhaps a decade too short, perhaps a moment. But a life always ends too soon.”
Millions of thankful stars and constellations to my superhero for sending me an eARC from Edelweiss!Info on the film adaptation with Schwab as screenwriter.","edit: i just want to reiterate, i do like and enjoy this book. however, i also can find issue within it. i'm not calling the book problematic, i'm just highlighting some aspects that i believe the book failed on. if you don't want to hear that then you don't have to read this review.i am also not calling this book racist, or ""making it about race"", as people who typically argue against these kinds of things would say, nor am i asking this book to be about Black people. i am simply suggesting that this book would've conveyed its themes a little better if they made it a bit more universal -- however, as people have also stated, perhaps this is to indicate addie's selfishness, which i can agree with.Déjà vu. Déjà su. Déjà vecu.The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue or The Invisible Life of Addie the Street conveys a tale about a girl who makes a faustian bargain with the devil and is thus forgotten by everyone she meets. Addie becomes convinced she must make her mark upon the world in unique and influential ways, as she believes that an idea can spark into so much more. It is a story that deals with the consequences of our actions, how one choice can make life fall apart at the seams, and how everyone, despite everything, truly wants to be remembered by someone.I was really excited about this novel, the story that V.E. Schwab would bring. I enjoyed her Shades of Magic series and I was intrigued to read her latest novel. As a fan of books that contain deals with gods and devils, I was hoping that this book was able to deliver, especially since some of my friends had loved it too. However, whilst this book emphasized on palimpsests and the meanings of making your mark, of love, and of finding your way in the world, I was lost in how not only white but how eurocentric this novel was.Eurocentrism (also Eurocentricity or Western-centrism) is a worldview that is centered on Western civilization or a biased view that favors it over non-Western civilizations.The writing was beautiful, but the story lacked some substance. Addie LaRue truly told us (emphasis on told) through her lens how difficult and hard her life was. How she was only a shadow, a whisper, a lost thought in the wind. Addie LaRue desperately wanted someone to remember her, to know her name, to know her story. However, as we traveled throughout Addie's life, I couldn't feel connected to her tale, to her story. She had lived for three hundred years, and yet the experiences we saw were so narrow in comparison to how grand her life could've been. We flashed back for only brief moments before returning back to New York for the main plot of the tale, and its focus on art, white culture, and history. I feel as though it concentrated on the ✨ white aesthetic ✨ of her experiences as opposed to ensuring it had good execution.The plot (is that the right word?) felt extremely repetitive, although potentially done on purpose to emphasize how painful it was for Addie to be forgotten, after a while, it began to lose its effect. Again, it could be to potentially showcase Addie becoming desensitized to her curse. However, it made the novel to be predictable, and at the end of it, I guessed what was going to happen, and I was left feeling meh. The emotional impact that the ending would've had was 85% lost. Henry's gift to Addie at the end was the only thing I felt for, the only thing I could connect to at the end. I thought he would write a novel about her life, and it just seems fourth-wall-breaking that the novel in the novel is also called The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue. It emphasized the fact that words are powerful, and the words you choose mean everything, especially in Addie's case. I also had problems with Addie's character, in the sense that she didn't evolve that much throughout the novel. I experienced the same feeling when reading another of Schwab's characters, Lila Bard. Addie is intelligent, calculated, and experienced whilst Lila is young, naive, and spontaneous. Addie is careful of the consequences whilst Lila doesn't care about them. However, I can't help but feel that both characters are similar in the sense that their extent of evolving surrounds becoming selfless as a result of their relationships. Lila becomes selfless through meeting Kell and changing her view of the world whilst Addie becomes more selfless through meeting Henry and experiencing what it feels to be remembered again. Whilst it was nice to see Addie change slightly and become hopeful, I felt as though she was still the same girl three hundred years prior, who had made the deal, with no regards as to how the (traumatic) events in history have shaped her, how it was to be in a German cell, how it was to live through wars and death. Instead, the story continued it's great focus on Addie wanting to be remembered like it was the only thing that mattered in the grand history of things. This is evident through her repetition of certain phrases throughout the novel, showing that she still holds onto her past which reinforces the person that she was, is, and will always be. Addie refuses to let go of it because only she can remember her past, and thus cannot change as a person. She wants to be the same person as it's how she wants to be remembered, she wants to be able to tell her story.One thing I did like was the anniversary between Luc and Addie. It was a nice touch and I personally enjoyed the conversations between them in the beginning, how it was two opposing forces that couldn't help but revolve around one another like two planets. Addie basically plays the longest game of doing things out of spite, just to prove a point and I loved that Luc came back with ""huh you thought"". Although near the end, I found that Luc became a lot more possessive and manipulative, as a god such as he usually does. But for the life of me, I cannot see why people would want Addie to be with him for that exact reason. Like Team ""Boy who remembers Addie"" or Team ""Tall, Dark (but white) and Handsome who not only plays with Addie, but manipulates, punishes and abuses her for not doing what he wants."" HMMMM??!??!?!?!!?!??!??Henry was... Henry. Whilst he was cute and I enjoyed reading his perspective and backstory, I just felt he only existed to give Addie's story more meaning. It felt as though Henry only existed so he could tell Addie's story, and we don't get to see what happens to him after publishing the novel. His role in the novel had been fulfilled, hence he was no longer needed in the end. I just wished Henry had a greater sense of purpose. This novel is a standalone according to Schwab, but the way that it ends implies that there'll be more to the story. Is this Schwab keeping a wedge in the door in case she decides to come back to the world, or is it just to leave readers intrigued as to how it all truly ends? We might never know.However, as I was reading this story, I couldn't help but feel uneasy. Something made me uncomfortable about this tale apart from the mild existential crisis I was having about whether I'd be remembered after I died. Addie's story is white, extremely white. We are shown one black woman, Bea, who Addie calls beautiful. That is it. Throughout her three hundred years of living, we aren't shown Addie being in any other continents apart from the UK, Europe, and America. Addie knows French, Italian, Spanish, Greek but doesn't think to learn other languages from non-white civilisations. It seems Addie LaRue wanted to be remembered, just not by people of colour. Someone managed to go around the world in 80 days whilst Addie has only visited three continents in three hundred years. The fact the only thing she can also say about a person of colour is that they're beautiful? It made me uncomfortable. This presentation of the west in a novel about the meaning of being remembered is ironic, as it's often the west that's remembered and exemplified in history, leaving the histories of people of colour to be forgotten, erased. Where were the references to colonisation, how France, Spain, Italy Britain, and America partook in the scramble for Africa? She was literally going between Germany and England during this time. Also, there is no excuse for her not to notice, oh i don't know, RACISM OR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SLAVES?! Like, it just shows how apathetic Addie LaRue is to colonization and slavery, and the fact she didn't note it at all in her history shows how complicit she was in the system. The fact that Henry never questions her on it either? I just find that this novel displayed such a white lens, it was blinding.I find that the eurocentric focus in this story just took the meaning of this novel away from me, as it just felt to me that whilst all these white people were trying to make marks upon the world, were trying to make themselves known and loved, Bea, the only person of colour, was just... tokenized in the narrative. In a story that focuses on the importance of leaving your mark, I feel like this book told me that the marks people of colour leave just aren't important or valued. also, voltaire??? really????This novel shows how much privilege Addie has in not needing to care about or notice the brutality and violence that people of colour suffered under during this time. It shows how fortunate she is in the fact that she feels the need to not mention it in her grand history, and instead only focus on the times in which she thought were important to her story. There is also the argument that Schwab intentionally left them out in order to not anger people of colour for the representation of their countries and cultures. However, sensitivity readers could've been employed and a majority of measures could've been taken to ensure the representation was somewhat accurate, and that there was at least more representation! We did get some queer rep though.Can I also just mention how funny it is that during the Civil Rights Movement in the 50s and 60s, Addie is ""Everywhere, Nowhere"", and yet fails to make one single comment about the impact of the movement? Oh yeah, it's because Addie is too self-absorbed in her curse, in the circumstances surrounding her curse, her desire to be wanted, remembered. Did Addie LaRue partake in the Civil Rights Marches? Did Addie LaRue meet Martin Luther King Jr.? Or was she too busy having sex with Luc instead? Questions we'll never know the answers to.I adored the exploration of the meaning of art, history and love. How in one instant, memories can slip away and your life could amount to nothing. However, Addie LaRue forces you to remember her in the text, as everyone else (apart from Luc and Henry), especially people of colour are simply forgotten. This is a well-written novel and one that I enjoyed experiencing. However, I can't help but feel I am not the target audience for this book, and instead it is a story for white people and white people alone.I've been rambling for the past three hours but I just hope this makes sense LMAOThe live show for The Late Night Book Club's discussion of The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue is on Noelle's channel, link is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTrg8..."
Malibu Rising,Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.03,"ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review white nuclear families will literally surf instead of going to therapy for their trauma this is one of those rare and extraordinary instances where my rage over a book propelled me through its pages at a speed i am totally unused to. i'm typically a slower reader, especially when losing myself in a world i love. this is because i enjoy soaking up details, really sitting with and unpacking the many layers that i've come to expect of long-form fiction. my experience with malibu rising was the utter opposite. i flew through the pages in a fit of wrath. if a five star novel is an onion, this was a single sheet of tissue paper. when i saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews this book has been racking up, i felt a similar confusion as i had last year, after finishing the invisible life of addie larue and finding that i was pretty alone in my dissatisfaction. i want to chalk this up to the fact that in both scenarios, i had never read a taylor jenkins reid or v.e. schwab book, respectively, and so had no biases or expectations coming into either book. i had never experienced these authors’ writing styles. i didn't know what to expect. i had no preconceived opinions to contend with. i was just along for the ride. part of me also wonders if maybe these books suffer from the cult classic syndrome so common on goodreads—the question of whether everyone genuinely enjoys these authors as much as they claim, or if, perhaps, their universal popularity among goodreads users has begun to affect the dimensions of public opinion/reviews. sometimes this website does feel like a bit of an echo chamber.i can't say for sure. i can only speak for myself when i write that i remain unmoved by author popularity or proclaimed talent. beloved books have no effect on me. neither do my goodreads friends' opinions (just as i'd hope my own opinions won't ""change"" anyone else's true feelings). even despite all of that, though, i know i'm not the wrong audience for these books. romance and found family are some of my favorite things to read about and when done well, it's not hard for a book to sway me, even with glaring faults.having said all of that, malibu rising was something of a disaster from start to finish. i feel like this preface is necessary because i know reid has garnered a very loyal fanbase. after combing through other reviews, i see that a few who have more extensive experience with her books feel this was a huge departure from fan favorites like daisy jones and the six and evelyn hugo. that's relieving to hear (even if i have no desire to ever pick up a book from this author again). this was very much commercial fiction and i'm wondering if that—commercial/genre trends—hasn't had some kind of effect on the quality of writing.before launching into the many issues i had with the novel, i want to warn you that i'm going to be laying out a good amount of spoilers.to begin to illustrate the many emotions i felt over the course of this novel, i have handpicked some annotation—of the 146 or so i jotted down—highlights from my kindle:• that's enough heterosexuality for today• fathers will be like hope i am not a person to you guys but a concept then disappear in a cloud of mist and wonder why you are deeply and irrevocably traumatized• what in the name of filler• IS IT EVERY BITCH IN THIS BOOK?• why i hate malibu rising? i will try to be brief (1/435)• and then the entire audience gasped• first plot point that doesn't piss me off (annotated 75% into the novel)• the men in this book: I HATE GETTING ACCUSED OF SOME SHIT I ACTUALLY DID 😡 WHO THE FUCK TOLD YOU• this reminds me of the great gatsby when jay is throwing the party to end all parties and then suddenly goes Everybody Log Out I Wanna Be alone with my hunny Rightnow LIKE BRO YOU LITERALLY INVITED THE ENTIRE TRISTATE AREA TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE? A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT• ""eww she fuck the tennis man for tennis balls"" - a bitch that's fucking the tennis man for Large Midcentury Unglazed Terracotta Planters on Standsnow, let me defend my one star rating. there are—generally speaking—three major components i look for in a novel and build a rating around (though they are often adjusted according to the parameters set by each individual book i read). plot is not listed among them because, in many cases, fully fleshed out characters are enough to carry a book for me. 1. writing2. characters3. worldto begin with: the writing. reid's is not particularly impressive. more often than not, i found the prose in this novel aggravating, prone to drama, awkwardly descriptive in places and absolutely barren in others. certain stylistic choices, like the third person omniscient perspective, make the novel feel clinical and impersonal—not because this perspective is inherently impersonal, but because reid's execution is. because the writing style keeps readers at arm's length, it does not feel like i know these characters. instead, it feels like i know someone else who does, someone relaying facts about people, with little to no introspection or interesting, informative character interaction. this drove me up the wall because i love third person omniscient—it might be my favorite point of view to both read and write—and i've seen it done fantastically, in ways that humanize characters, that make you feel intimately, humiliatingly connected to fictional people. this was not that.readers travel backwards and forwards through time, watching the story of the riva children's parents unfold in the past, then catapulting back into the present as these children grapple with what it means to grow up parentless in old hollywood over a 24 hour time period. the structure is designed to create an impression of cause and effect, but because reid lays it on so thick, vaulting back and forth through time quickly becomes tedious.since we're on the topic of laying it on thick: the melodrama, dialed all the way up, sits at a resting 100% throughout the novel, while any sense of reward falls flat. it's a lot like listening to a radio station that's nothing but static at the highest possible volume setting. i'm getting this outpouring of sound, but it's doing nothing for me, evokes no reaction, is more grating than it is gratifying.in a prologue that seems to want to emulate celeste ng's little fires everywhere, readers are informed through foreshadowing that nina riva's big hollywood party is doomed to end in flames. this prepares readers for a habit the narrative is guilty of repeatedly and unapologetically committing: melodramatic foreshadowing, or preemptive, godlike observations. sometimes this foreshadowing arrives chapters before a certain realization or reckoning unfolds in real time; sometimes, pages. others, mere paragraphs. this writing device colors the novel completely, making eventual emotional payoff feel cheap, and unearned. it blunts the impact of conflict, stifles anticipation, and turns a mounting sense of tension into a plateau of exhaustion. the consequence of this choice is that i was no longer willing to be surprised by reid's writing. i expected every plot twist. i saw things coming from a mile away. i was biding my time while i waited impatiently for the book to end, and even after finally getting my emotional vindication as things came to a close, i was left ultimately unsatisfied. why? because i'd figured out the plot of malibu rising by the 10% mark.this tediousness is never more true than with the novel's failed romance, which brings us to characters.in the goodreads version of this review, i'm only going to touch on one of those romances: june and mick riva. if you want my take on nina and brandon, you can check my blog.aside from the fact that mick is a grown man seducing a seventeen-year-old girl, we know from the beginning that his romance with june is doomed to end in tragedy. more of that pesky foreshadowing: ""the story of june and mick riva seemed like a tragedy to their oldest child, nina."" as readers come to learn, june is the victim of a serial cheater who up and abandons his children on a whim to fuck what we can only assume are hundreds of women (at times as young as eighteen) over the course of his music career, fathering clandestine children while married, divorcing his wife to remarry one of the many women he's having a public affair with, returning to briefly atone for his sins to his family, then running off to remarry again. and again. and again. it was exhausting to type that little summary out. now imagine reading an unreasonably drawn out retelling of that story, when you know every step of the way what kind of man mick is, and just how eagerly june is going to open her doors for him despite it.the worst part isn't the fact that june is cheated on, over and over, without remorse, while she sits at home performing domestic labor for her (ex-)husband. no. the worst offense is that mick is the crux of june's entire character.while he is permitted a career, a more fleshed out origin story, and desires wholly independent of the women of this world, all june ever aspires to be is the housewife and mother waiting at the window for her cheating husband to return. she has no personality beyond loving mick. from introduction until death, she is waiting and hoping mick will return in order to complete her, to give her what she needs to become a functioning human again. because, ""...to june, it was, always and forever, a romance.""that, to me, is most egregious.all the time spent trying to paint a picture of generational trauma to explain the gleeful ways in which mick exploits women for personal gain—the ways he sees them only insofar as they can perform for him as sexual objects—could have gone to understanding june and her family outside of a man.it is choices like these that sabotage the characters in malibu rising, which is a bit of a lead-in to its world. at times, i forgot that i wasn't reading contemporary fiction. it's only offhand details like random celebrity name-drops (occasionally real celebrities, occasionally fictional) that remind readers these characters are living in the past. malibu rising features a weak facsimile of old hollywood, only believable in that the men of this world are unrepentantly shitty and more often white than not. imagine if the great gatsby were a lifetime made-for-tv movie adaptation. that's the way this book reads.reid expends most of her effort trying to build a believable party in the second half of the novel that feels vintage enough to convince you it could be real. how is this achieved? no, not through lush detail and three-dimensional characters. through slipshod head-jumping. which brings me to my next point: filler.i would argue that over half of this novel is filler. in fact, i have counted at least nineteen filler chapters (or ""sections"") in this book—meaning, had they been discarded during the editing process or even condensed into larger combined chapters, the narrative landscape would have remained completely and totally unchanged. in other words, they serve no real purpose. they exist to take up time and space. in a book that is 384 pages long, this choice is particularly needless.malibu rising's second half (aptly called ""part two"") displays the very worst of this habit. as is often the case with sloppily executed omniscient narration, we head-jump from secondary character to secondary character—though i think calling them ""secondary characters"" is being generous; they're more like throwaway characters—spending brief, vignette-like interludes with hollywood caricatures who have no time to make any kind of lasting impression on readers. these filler sections are typically around 1-3 pages long and are characterized by washed up celebrities who are either a.) extremely horny, b.) looking to find their ""true love,"" or c.) some combination thereof. i can see that reid was attempting to humanize or at least fill up the party nina throws through these odd perspective shifts. and yet, rarely does the choice to inhabit secondary characters' heads pay off for writers. here, it is a spectacular failure. time that should gone to the riva siblings and their far more interesting chafing and tenderness is thrown away on...what...? censored threesomes? scummy movie stars groping women and getting away with it? in what world does a three page chapter outlining a celebrity's fictional film successes take precedence over actual plot and main character development? in malibu rising's second half, there are at least eighteen characters whose heads we're flitting to and from. yes, i counted. at times, these shifts aren't even marked by new chapters or sections. sometimes a perspective leap takes place over a single paragraph, in a fleeting interjection from one character before we melt back into whoever the book has decided is the main show for the moment. of over twenty badly written characters, i liked a total of two. nina and kit, one of which i was pleased to accurately predict was—spoiler—gay. the other pissed me off up until around the 80% mark, before her character development really kicked in and i finally breathed a sigh of relief. even still, the way the novel fought tooth and nail to try to convince us that mick is a complex man right up until the bitter end made this experience decidedly hair-pulling. if malibu rising wanted a morally grey character, the book did a terrible job characterizing him as such. he was unambiguously awful from start to finish. so throwing in lines like, “‘i think he’s an asshole. but i can’t be sure. i don’t actually know him well enough to say,’” from his own permanently traumatized child after we’ve spent 350+ pages watching him abandon his blood to live without either parent or even a stable income is more than a little patronizing. i mean, come on. can the novel have some backbone? this book gets one star from me because it didn’t check off any major components from my informal list and because i experienced not one ounce of personal enjoyment over the course of this harrowing journey. i wanted to rage-quit this book like a video game with bad graphics and worse writing more times than i can count. questions like, what do men have? fueled me for nearly 400 pages, all so i could give an answer i already, deep in my heart of hearts, knew: the audacity.if i had to sum up my feelings on this book using one of its own quotes, it would have to be...
“tarine shook her head. […] ‘you people are revolting.’”","I love a good prank as much as the next person, which is to say: kind of, sometimes, hypothetically, and not when it happens to me.So the fact that I am forced to assume that this book represents the culmination of a years-long trick you all have been playing on me is NOT good news.I have read everything Taylor Jenkins Reid has ever written, from when she wrote exclusively in the tiny micro-genre of Chick Lit About Bad Things Happening To Kind Boring Women And The Aftermath, to now, when she writes exclusively in the tiny micro-genre of Historical Fiction Set In The Back Half Of The Twentieth Century About Good Women Doing Bad Or Neutral Things In The Name Of Generic Feminism. I have never given any of it below a 2.5 rounded up, and even that was of the ""this is trash but fun trash"" variety.SO I ANTICIPATED THIS WITH GREAT EAGERNESS. An eagerness that was only FUELED by the ENDLESS loving reviews and GLORIFYING hype and UNDYING high average rating!But you guys!This book isn't good!It's been so goddamn long since I've been in this position. I got tired of being the unpopular opinion girl. I got sick of yucking your collective yum, but more importantly, I was not super into dreading checking my own comments on a regular basis. So I worked on myself. I was in the brain equivalent of a superhero workout montage. (I'm realizing now - why would a superhero really need to work out? They're magic. I think I'm making this up. I don't watch superhero movies, because again, I GOT TIRED OF BEING THE UNPOPULAR OPINION GIRL.) (It all comes full circle.)I actually tried to pick up only books I really thought I would like. And it worked! Kinda. My average rating hit ever so slightly above 3 stars for the first time in years. Huge for me, depressing for anyone else - which is my wheelhouse, generally.And then this book came along. WHICH I SHOULD HAVE LIKED.And it ruined...everything.I'm just going to say it: This book is poorly written. It tells without showing. The descriptions are insane. The chapter endings are continually bizarre, alternating between saccharine and nonsensical and a combination of both. Compared to TJR's other books, I feel like somehow an early draft was published by mistake and everyone just has to run with it to avoid embarrassment.It is, top to bottom, overly sweet.And, while I typically do care about the often-boring sometimes-not characters that popular Reid's books, and I feel for the nightmarish scenarios that nonstop befall them almost too much, that wasn't so true here. In essence, I felt bad for these people without caring about them. Does that make sense? In other words it was all the downsides of empathy with none of the ups. AND I LOVE BOOKS ABOUT SIBLINGS. I am someone with three of them, and I downright adore those bozos. There's nothing I love reading about more than found families and real families. But the goddamn Rivas didn't even feel like siblings, to me. More like weird friends, each with half of a personality, so on the 2 pages they're together you can pretend there are only two and they're real people.I am so upset.Bottom line: Ms Jenkins Reid, please go back to the chick lit. Just for one book. Then we can talk about this later.I need a break.------------------pre-reviewokay. honesty hour. everyone knows this isn't good and is just pranking me, right?...i can't be the unpopular opinion girl again. i won't do it.either way, review to come / 1.5 stars------------------currently-reading updatesbrought this on a train because i thought it'd be a pleasure to binge read. instead i had to force myself through the first 100 pages.send thoughts and prayers.------------------tbr reviewlook at me. look me in the eyes. anything taylor jenkins reid writes. ANYTHING. i will read it.","Tatatataaaa! May I present to you one of the best reads of 2021?During my read:	•	I cried a lot…	•	I sniffled…	•	I giggled at the sarcastic humor of the author when she described the party-animal celebrities!	•	My heart warmed at the close, honest relationships of the four siblings.	•	I was mesmerized by the whirlwind time travel between the ’50s and ’80s!I was shaken to my core—emotions were all over the place after reading Mick and June’s tragic, explosive, heartbreaking story!TJR is one of my all-time favorite historical fiction authors! She masterfully tells unique and original life stories by creating flawed, broken, but resilient characters who never stop fighting.In this book, she focuses on the Riva family, with two main storylines: (1) the Riva family’s history starting from the mid-1950s, and (2) Nina’s annual Malibu house party, attended by powerful socialites, famous artists, including popular actors, musicians, athletes, surfers, and tennis players who really know how to party!If this book were only about Mick and June’s heart-wrenching story, I would have given it ten stars! The flashbacks to the family’s history, the couple’s toxic, sorrowful relationship, and Nina’s sacrifices—becoming a mother to her siblings, giving up her life to protect them and provide them with better conditions—broke my heart multiple times.I loved the siblings’ unwavering loyalty. Interestingly, not only Nina but also Jay, Hud, and Kit acted as the mature ones in the family while their parents behaved like children. Kit, the youngest, was especially quick-witted, emotional, and straightforward; she never held back. Her slow journey of self-discovery regarding her sexuality, her capabilities, and her brave life choices was compelling.The boys were somewhat overshadowed by their two tough, vibrant sisters, but I still enjoyed seeing their growth and their determination to be better men than their father.The only reason I docked a star was the party theme, which had “Little Fires Everywhere” vibes (two sisters, two brothers, and a house on fire). While I enjoyed reading about the eccentric, entertaining characters and their scandalous side stories that night, I wished the focus had remained solely on the Rivas—how they faced their past, their secrets, and the things holding them back from moving forward.When too many characters are added into the mix, it’s still enjoyable, but it can slightly distract from the main story.I loved the conclusion, especially Nina’s transformation. By the end, she learns to stand up for herself, refusing to be the victim of her story!Even though I gave it four stars, I can honestly say I loved reading this book and being introduced to these shiny, well-crafted characters.This will be one of the most thought-provoking, sensational, and popular fiction novels of the coming year, and I’m thrilled to have had the privilege of reading an advance copy! TJR awakens the artistic soul of her readers with her extraordinarily creative and realistic storytelling.I highly recommend this book, not just to her fans, but to all historical fiction enthusiasts!Special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/Ballantine Books for sharing this reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter"
The Names,Florence Knapp,4.24,"wow, equally beautiful as it was heartbreaking. we follow 3 alternating versions of one storyline full of “what ifs” that can change so many people’s lives in an instant, all based off of what a child was named… please please check tws!","Florence Knapp’s debut novel, The Names, absolutely lives up to the hype as one of the most anticipated fiction releases of the year. With its thought-provoking and highly creative speculative premise, this novel explores how a single name can define a person’s fate, shaping their relationships and leading them down vastly different life paths.I devoured this book in one sitting, completely captivated by the unique and emotionally rich journeys of Bear (strong, brave, and warm-hearted), Julian (inspired by the sky, limitless and ambitious), and Gordon (immovable, looming, shaped by tradition). Their lives unfold in three separate timelines, each revealing the profound impact of a single decision—one name.The story begins on a pivotal day for Cora, a mother of two, as she walks to the registration office to officially name her newborn son. Her husband, Gordon—a respected doctor—insists the child be named after him to continue their family legacy. But Cora hesitates. She fears history will repeat itself, that her son will become a mirror image of his father—a man who, like his own controlling father, hides his toxic nature behind a mask of prestige. Trapped in a marriage where she endures suffering to protect her children, she realizes this is her one chance to change the course of her son’s life. By choosing a different name—perhaps ""Bear"" to make him strong and kind, or ""Julian"" to give him the boundless potential of the sky—she hopes to set him free from the cycle of the past.This single decision splinters into three possible futures, following Cora, her daughter Maia, her mother Silbhe, and her son—who in different realities lives as Bear, Julian, or Gordon—across 35 years. Through their joys, losses, struggles, and triumphs, the novel masterfully examines how identity, fate, and personal choices intertwine. Each timeline invites deep reflection on the paths we take in life and the power a name holds in shaping destiny.Without giving too much away, I can say that by the time I reached the final chapter, I was overwhelmed with emotion. The Names is filled with poignant moments, deeply relatable characters, and a message that lingers long after the last page. It’s one of those rare books that nestles into your heart and continues to resonate for years to come.Final thoughts: This is hands down one of the best books of 2025—a must-read that deserves a spot on your TBR list immediately! If you love alternative-universe stories, Sliding Doors-style ""what if"" scenarios, or emotionally gripping narratives with unexpected twists, The Names is calling for you.Many thanks to NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP VIKING/Pamela Dorman Books for providing this fantastic debut’s digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","‘Tomorrow - if morning comes, if the storm stops raging - she'll register the name of her son. Or perhaps, and this is her real concern, she'll formalise who he will become.’
The Names is like a literary choose your own adventure, except you, the reader, are strapped to a ride powered by maternal guilt, patriarchy, and multiverse melancholy and you’ll love every twisty second of it.Cora, fresh out of an abusive marriage and knee deep in postnatal chaos, must name her newborn son. Seems simple. But Florence Knapp who apparently woke up and chose narrative complexity splits the story into three timelines based on the name she gives him: Gordon (ugh), Bear (yes, like the animal), and Julian (classy, probably has a trust fund). Each name leads to an entirely different life, and not just for the kid, Cora, her daughter Maia, and an entire constellation of relationships morph with every choice.Knapp pulls off a literary hat trick here: The Names is sharp, gut punchingly emotional, and weirdly suspenseful. You will find yourself wondering things like, “What if I’d been named Persephone? Would I be a poet with a wolfdog and a collection of vintage blenders?” That’s the magic here, Knapp doesn’t just explore the power of a name, she weaponizes it.Also: Bear’s timeline? Surprisingly legit. Do not underestimate the emotional growth of a child named after a woodland creature.If Sliding Doors, Everything Everywhere All at Once, and your deepest maternal fears had a baby, it would be The Names and it would probably grow up to be a Booker Prize nominee. Read The Names if you enjoy time loops, maternal drama, and low stakes existential crises wrapped in gorgeous prose. Congratulations Florence Knapp, what a phenomenal debut! My Highest Recommendation. Thank you Hachette for my early readers copy.Available now!"
The Briar Club,Kate Quinn,4.30,"As a devoted fan of Kate Quinn’s historical fiction novels, I happily delve into them without concern for their length. Once I immerse myself in one of her works, I find myself captivated by her stories and deeply engaged with her characters, just as I did with her latest offering.The opening was intriguing: the story begins in 1954, in Washington D.C., at a woman’s boarding house called Briarwood House on Thanksgiving Day, where a brutal murder occurs. One of the boarders may be the culprit, but the identity of the victim remains unknown, although we learn that the murder took place in the room of a boarder named Grace March.We then quickly jump back four years earlier to follow thirteen-year-old Pete, who shoulders more responsibilities at a young age to help his mother as a handyman at the boarding house. He takes care of his sister, who suffers from lazy eye and a learning disorder. Through his perspective, we are introduced to the boarders, including Grace March, who moves into the attic's shoebox room. Grace is a mysterious widow, tight-lipped about her past, who easily befriends the other boarders: the beautiful young mother Fliss, whose doctor husband works in San Diego as the approaching Korean War affects the political climate; Nora, the youngest of them at only twenty, who works for the National Archives and is having a love affair with a gangster despite being the daughter of a police officer; Beatrice, an ex-baseball player whose career was cut short by WWII and her injuries; Reka, an elderly Hungarian immigrant; and Arlene, a secretary for HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) who becomes a devoted supporter of McCarthy’s Red Scare.These women, each from different backgrounds and dealing with their own demons and regrets, gather around Grace’s attic room to heal their emotional scars with the sweet taste of Grace’s special sun tea, sharing their love, hate, and miseries under the tight bond of friendship. But Grace’s secrets threaten the sacred bond they've built, and unexpected violent tragedies may tear their lives apart. In the end, each of them must make a choice to differentiate between who is their real friend and who is the enemy hiding among them.Overall, the characterization in this book is remarkable. You can easily connect with each of the women, embracing them with their flaws and mistakes without judgment. Though it may seem like a long journey, you never want it to end because the pacing is incredibly balanced, including the heart-throbbing action parts. Nothing feels rushed or overly repetitive or dragging. The trajectory of events is executed perfectly, and the conclusion is also very satisfying.This is definitely one of my favorite historical fiction reads of the year, and I highly recommend it.Many thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for providing me with this remarkable book's digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughtsmedium bloginstagramfacebook twitter","The Briar Club opens with a death. Or two. A whodunnit.The Briar Club is a home, in the 1950’s, whose rooms are rented out to women. They meet every Thursday for a meal in an attic room. Both young and old. All struggling with emotional battles of their past. But Grace, the latest tenant, brings these women together: To celebrate food and life; To recognize we all need community to survive rather than being isolated and alone; to lift each other up, at their lowest point.She does tackle some tough themes: domestic violence, poverty, homosexuality, discrimination, and abandonment. Too much for one story IMO.What I could have done without: the multiple POV’s with the house being one; the recipes; the baking contest.Not my favourite but an ok one 3.75⭐️","‘If these walls could talk. Well, they may not be talking, but they are certainly listening. And watching.’
Kate Quinn’s The Briar Club is a fascinating dive into the 1950s, wrapped up in a cozy murder mystery. If you love historical fiction with a touch of suspense and strong female leads, this book is a must read.Set in Washington, D.C., the story kicks off with a shocking murder at Briarwood House, a slightly run down boardinghouse exclusively for women. Grace March, the new tenant in the attic, is at the heart of the story. She quickly becomes the glue that holds together an eclectic group of boarders: an elegant Englishwoman, a police officer’s daughter mixed up with a gangster, a former baseball star, and a die hard McCarthy supporter.What makes this book a delight is how it captures the era’s societal changes, particularly the evolving roles of women. Grace's weekly dinner parties in her attic room become a symbol of camaraderie and healing, even as she harbors her own dark secret.Quinn excels at creating strong, relatable women who each face their own struggles and secrets. The dynamics between them are both heartwarming and tense, adding layers of depth to the story. Plus, the inclusion of recipes from Grace’s supper club adds a charming, personal touch. The characters are well drawn and relatable, and the plot keeps you guessing until the end. Plus, the chapters from the house’s perspective are a quirky and fun addition.One of the standout aspects of this book is how it captures the era’s atmosphere, suspicion, the Korean War, and the early days of the birth control pill are all woven into the plot. Quinn’s attention to historical detail is impeccable, making you feel like you’ve been transported back in time.If you’re a fan of historical fiction, strong female leads, and a good mystery, you’ll likely find ‘The Briar Club’ a rewarding read. Just be prepared for a slower pace, as this one dives deep into character development and setting the scene.The Briar Club is a rich, immersive novel that offers a fresh take on the historical mystery genre. It’s perfect for a cozy weekend read and would make a fantastic book club pick. I Highly Recommend. Thank you HarperCollins Australia for gifting me a copy of The Briar Club for review."
The Berry Pickers,Amanda    Peters,4.10,"What a book!! And to think that I didn’t even want to read this book, and it is now one of my all time favorites! Did the title appeal to me? No. The cover? Not so much. The synopsis? Not really. But when I opened up this book, each page just took my breath away. I can’t remember the last time I read a more magical, compelling book. I felt like I personally knew each character and experienced every sliver of pain, grief, and trauma that they went through. I didn’t ever want this book to end. This story starts off with a Mi’kmaq family from Nova Scotia arriving in Maine to pick blueberries for the summer. Of the five children, Ruthie is the youngest at only four years old. One day while sitting by a big rock near her brother Joe, she suddenly vanishes. A search went on for weeks without much help from the local authorities. Ruthie was never found. Her brother Joe was only six years old at the time, but for all his years he held out hope that she was still alive. Joe also carried around a ton of guilt as he was the last person to have seen Ruthie before she vanished. “And besides, when a person dies, there’s a finality to it, a heaviness that comes with all endings.” We also have the story of Norma. Norma lives a very sheltered life, with a mother and father who keep a very tight leash on her. She is well cared for, but often feels that things just aren’t quite right. Norma also has recurring dreams that her mother tells her are just nonsense. Why does she feel an emptiness inside, and will it ever go away? While we could guess where this story was going, it didn’t matter because it was so beautifully written. A friend of mine at work gave me this book to read, and because he’s an avid reader at 90 years old (yes you read that right), I couldn’t say no. All I can say is that he picks better books than I do, and moving forward I will be asking for more book recommendations from him because this book was a total winner 🏆 One that I highly recommend reading! “Time quickens the older you get, as if the universe is trying to push you toward the finish line, to make room for the younger, the stronger, to mark your brief place in history and move on.”","Unsatisfying and lacking in intensity. I only kept listening to find out the why behind Ruthie's disappearance, the rest of the story was too uneventful and unimpassioned to maintain momentum or really invest in the characters.The interwoven story lines took a different route than I imagined. It's not that I was expecting a mystery, but I was thinking Norma would be more questioning about herself throughout and it would play a more central role to the entire book.The story spans decades, often passing over large gaps in time, and felt too scattered to develop the characters or the narrative in a thorough and effective manner. I didn't find the writing to be descriptive enough of people or happenings, the characters were two-dimensional, and what you did learn about them was told rather than shown. I often felt like I was being given just the basic facts in a broad and sweeping outline.I did like Joe's character, which was rather sad given Norma's prominent role, I should have liked her character more but Joe's character was more emotionally developed. I did wonder why the author chose to only share his and Norma's perspectives as it only seemed to hamper the author's possible objective. I most enjoyed the first few chapters as they showed the family connection and also the last few chapters as they showed the family coming to terms with an altered family and how and where each person fit in. An okay book, with a real shortcoming in the fact that other themes lurking below the surface could have been explored more deeply and which would have likely bolstered the less satisfying parts.","The Berry Pickers is an immersive and stunningly written debut novel by Amanda Peters. Every summer, a Mi’kmaq family travels from Nova Scotia to Maine to pick berries. A few weeks into the season, the youngest child, Ruthie, vanishes without a trace. Her older brother Joe was the last person to see her. That fact will sit heavy with him for years to come. Norma grows up in a wealthy household but is plagued with dreams that she cannot understand. And her loving but controlling mother refuses to discuss them. As Norma grows older, she realizes her parents are hiding something from her. This beautifully written novel follows Joe and Norma’s perspectives. This is a moving and powerful story with sprinkles of Indigenous humour here and there. It discusses the loss of language and culture, the threat of residential schools, and MMIW. But it also shines a light on the importance of family. Even with the heavier topics, there is a sense of hopefulness by the end. The story slowly drew me in, and by the end, I wished there were more pages. Both of the main characters completely captured my heart. I highly recommend adding this wonderful debut to your TBR as soon as possible. Thank you to Harper Perennial for providing an arc via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. https://booksandwheels.com"
The Griffin Sisters' Greatest Hits,Jennifer Weiner,3.91,"I'm so sad to say this, but since I have read just about every Jennifer Weiner book, this may be my least favorite.It has everything that I could want:Women who do bad ass thingsovercoming adversityearly 2000s rockrags to richeslove mixed in between​It's just too bad that this ended up being what could have been an enigmatic story about two sisters, rise to fame one who is constantly being told she's too pretty, but not as talented, as her overweight sister (it's mentioned far too much for me). Together, they become an overnight sensation, make one amazing album, and then disappear overnight with no explanation.Cassie has all but disappeared to Alaska, while Zoe has lived the quiet suburban life. Both are living the life off the grid, and haven't spoken to each other in 20 years since a ""mystery"" life event tore them apart. Cherry, Zoe's daughter leaves home to star on an American Idol like show, without telling her family where she is. Cassie ends up going viral after being recorded singing Happy Birthday to a grocery store employee in Alaska. Cherry then sets herself on the path to find Cassie so she can mentor her for the show.While this book had SO much potential, I just wasn't invested in any of the characters. The scenes of the Griffin Sisters as stars was rather mundane. I wanted more fun and punch to what should have been such a fun music era. Cassie is constantly being told to us that she was/is indeed ""overweight"", and Zoe was the pretty one. By the end once the mystery is unfolded, there is redemption, but overall, I just didn't care. Sad to say, this will be a big hit in 2025, as all of her books are so much fun, but this missed the mark for me.","Sisters, music, motherhood, stardom, romance, love, and consequences. The Griffin Sisters' Greatest Hits was a gripping read about two sisters, Cassie and Zoe Grossberg. The sisters are polar opposites and shared one year in the spotlight until their band broke up following a tragedy. I found this book to be intriguing, thought provoking, moving, and entertaining. I felt for the characters, cheered for their triumphs, felt for their heartbreak, watched their stumbles, cringed at their bad decisions, observed their passion, enjoyed their relationships, and was in awe of their love of music. Cassie is a musical prodigy. She has the voice of an angel and plays the piano. She is painfully shy and would prefer to stay out of the spotlight. Zoe, full of charm and determinations, loves the spotlight and stardom. They rise to fame and for one year ruled the airways and concert scene. Then following a horrible event/tragedy the band broke up. Twenty years later, Cassie is living a quiet life while Zoe is a married mother. Cherry, Zoe's teenage daughter, is desperate to be a star and sets out on a quest to reach her goal and find out why her mother's band broke up. I enjoyed this book and the characters. I thought Jennifer Weiner did a great job with creating both Cassie and Zoe. She created two characters who were so different yet needed each other. They loved each other and were a team until they weren't. I felt for both characters. I felt for Cassie's shyness which felt more like social phobia, and her quiet nature. I loved how music set her free and allowed her to shine. Zoe, who wanted to be a star but didn't have Cassie's talents. Zoe who wanted it all and found that having it all wasn't what she thought it would be. Cherry who longs to find fame and show off her talents. Cherry who is resilient and brave even though her mother, Zoe, who doesn't want her daughter involved in the music industry. All the women in this book had spunk and determination but in different ways. Actions have consequences and all three will have to face the consequences of actions taken long ago. This book is told in two timelines, and I enjoyed the path Jennifer Weiner took to bring the past and present together in The Griffin Sisters' Greatest Hits. Usually, I enjoy one timeline more than the other but, in this book, I found both timelines to be engaging, captivating, and gripping. 3.5 stars Thank you to William Morrow and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own. Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖","3.5 rounded down A mother‘s love?Brilliant, talented daughters in Cassie and Zoe. Cassie Grossberg is the introverted, musical prodigy whereas Zoe is charming, beautiful and outgoing. Chalk and cheese. The sisters become part of a pop sensation known as The Griffin Sisters in the early 2000’s, then tragedy breaks up the band. Over twenty years of silence follows between the sisters as Cassie lives reclusively in Alaska and Zoe buries herself in suburban motherhood in New Jersey. Clearly something catastrophic occurs to break up their musical success – can they ever forgive each other and themselves? Will they ever be able to make music together again? Zoe‘s daughter Cherry sincerely hopes so as she too has musical aspirations and her aunt has the voice of an angel. Is it possible for a reunion to take place on the 25th anniversary of their hit album? There are aspects of the book that I really like and which work well but other areas that I’m less keen on. The complex relationships are conveyed successfully, between mothers and daughters and between the sisters. I enjoy the ups and downs of their life on the road as a band especially the various dynamics. The sisters different memories of that time are often painful and it’s emotional reading in places. There are strong feelings displayed too, with everything from love to jealousy, from fury to hatred with vindictive or deceitful actions which become secret shames.Many of the characters are not especially easy to like and I don’t find them relatable. I sympathise particularly with Cassie, you feel her awkwardness and I dare say she’s on the neurodivergent spectrum but that’s not mentioned much except in passing. I don’t know what to make of the constant references to her size, it’s constantly emphasised and she is compared to glossy, pretty, slim Zoe. I’m sure the author is just trying to demonstrate the prejudice against Cassie despite her considerable talent especially in the early 2000’s but it’s not comfortable to read.It’s a bit all over the place and dizzying at the beginning of the book with several points of view and it jumps about timewise but once I sort out the characters, it’s okay. However, in my opinion, it’s overly long and too detailed in places which slows the pace down and some interest is lost. There’s repetition too via the different points of view.I enjoy the ending although it’s probably a predictable one though it’s what I hope for. The novel will inevitably be compared to Daisy Jones and the Six and I don’t think it’s as good as that, but it’s enjoyable nonetheless. I assume the novel is inspired by the Mamas and the Papas although Cassie is very different in personality to the outgoing Mama Cass.With thanks to NetGalley and especially to HQ for a much appreciated arc in return for an honest review."
The Lion Women of Tehran,Marjan Kamali,4.49,"4.5⭐️The Lion Women of Tehran by Marjan Kamali was one of my most anticipated reads of 2024 and I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. “Shir zan. Lionesses. Us. Can’t you just see it, Ellie? Someday, you and me—we’ll do great things. We’ll live life for ourselves. And we will help others. We are cubs now, maybe. But we will grow to be lionesses. Strong women who make things happen.”Written in beautiful prose, this evocative story spans the 1950s through the 70s and 80s to the present day and follows Elaheh “Ellie” Soltani and Homa Roozbeh – girls from completely different backgrounds who meet in Tehran as seven-year-olds who become fast friends but drift apart - a cycle that continues as their lives intersect time and time again and their fates intertwine against the volatile backdrop of the Iranian Revolution and the decades that follow. The author addresses several important themes, including social class, feminism, women’s rights and political activism, and the immigrant experience, while also giving us a glimpse into Iranian life and culture. The story is set in Tehran for most of the 50s and 60s and both the United States and Tehran for the remainder of the novel. The narrative is presented predominantly from Ellie’s perspective, though we do get a few segments from Homa’s perspective. Both main characters are well fleshed out and their dynamic as it evolves over decades is realistically depicted, but I wish we could have explored a few of the crucial secondary characters in more depth. I also wish Homa’s perspective had been in more detail and that her story had been told with less telling and more showing particularly toward the end of the novel.The themes in Marjan Kamali’s latest novel are realistic, relatable and most importantly, timely and relevant. The author’s portrayal of the changing socio-political landscape of Iran during the Iranian revolution and its aftermath with emphasis on women’s rights will inspire reflection. We can’t help but ponder over the fact that many of us have been afforded freedoms that others do not enjoy - freedoms that we often take for granted and rights that women all over the world have fought for in their own time and continue to do so today. “That’s how losses of rights build. They start small. And then soon, the rights are stripped in droves.”Overall, I found this to be an immersive and thought-provoking story about friendship, courage, healing, empathy and acceptance, forgiveness and redemption, with characters who will stay with you long after you have turned the last page.I paired my reading with the audiobook brilliantly narrated by Mozhan Navabi and Nikki Massoud.“In my women’s organization and our activism, one thing that we're trying to uphold is that feminism comes in many shapes. We should not shame women who choose to take care of home and family. As long as it’s the woman’s choice. I don’t mean to imply that your job now, or even if you chose in the past or later choose to stay home, is in any way antifeminist. Because all of it has a place in true feminism. A woman has a right to live a life of intense career ambition or one of more mellow ambition or what have you. As I say, whatever she chooses.” I couldn’t agree more. What could be more important to a woman than her right to choose?Connect with me! ✏ Instagram ✏ My Blog ✏ The StoryGraph","based on other readers reviews, i was wholly prepared for this story to emotionally overwhelm me. fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), that wasnt the case. while this novel didnt deliver the emotional punch i was expecting it to, it does fulfil its promise at providing a story filled with feminine courage and moral fortitude. ellie and homa are good examples of what women have always been fighting for and will continue to do so, especially in places where it is dangerous to do so. so even though this book didnt quite tug at my heartstrings, i deeply admire the characters and appreciate reading their story. ↠ 3.5 stars","I am woman, hear me roar. 2 girls become unlikely friends in Iran: one from the slums, the other from the upper class. A country on the verge of a revolution in 1979. Homa wants to be a judge. Fight for people who can’t fight for themselves. Ellie, privileged, has the goal of marrying and having a large family. 2 women with very different dreams but somehow the best of friends. Until Homa goes missing - In a country that suffocates women who have a voice. A patriarchal culture. 1979 was a horrific year when Khomeini came into power. The hijab mandatory. Morality police seeking out strands of hair; exposed flesh. Women who dared use their voice would be incarcerated- but that’s not the least of what could happen to them. Women's roars are not heard in a country that does not value them; A country that continually perpetuates injustices and inequality. The power of friendship within these boundaries on the edge of a precipice along with democracy and women’s rights. And 50 years later, the country has still not evolved, yet, many women still fight.4.25⭐️"
The Life Impossible,Matt Haig,3.49,"Like the other Matt Haig books I’ve read, I’ll be thinking about The Impossible Life for a while. Probably enjoyed this one the most. It’s one of those books that when you pause after twenty minutes to see how many pages are in the book, it’s not because you’re debating giving up on it, it’s to see how much more entertainment you’ve got left and whether you should reschedule your afternoon.","I so wanted to love this, but unfortunately it didn’t feel as magical as his other books and it all became a bit too strange.","Okay, so you know when you're in a one-sided conversation and you're just humoring the other person? Like, they are very sweet and their message is a good one... but it's all a bit wordy, a bit convoluted, a bit weird but in a side-eye way rather than in a diverting way. You respect this person so you nod along, you smile and try to act interested, understanding, or shocked in all the right places. But MOSTLY you are bored out of your gourd.That was this book."
The Rose Code,Kate Quinn,4.45,"***IF YOU READ ONE HISTORICAL FICTION THIS YEAR, THIS SHOULD BE IT, IN PAPERBACK NOW***I absolutely love Kate Quinn, I have been waiting for a new book from her ever since her last novel “The Huntress”. I love her novels about women spies. The Rose Code is something a bit different. This novel focuses on three very different women who come together to help the British solve the codes that the Germans have been sending back and forth to their troops, leaders, etc.This novel isn’t short, at 656 pages, it’s not a quick read. I savored it, let myself get lost in it and allowed myself time for all of the imagery, information and wonderful characters to sink in. I became lost in the story almost immediately. The time frame is 1940 through 1947. We begin with the introductions of characters and how they all meet up at Bletchley Circle. Mab lived a life of poverty and was determined to find a man to marry, someone of some means to help her rise to a level where she didn’t have to worry every day about how she would get by. She ends up being adept at fixing the machines that the codebreakers use. Osla has come from a family of wealth. She has been dating Phillip for years and they have a friendship/love relationship for many years. She wants to help in the war effort and not just making bandages!! She wants to show that a “deb” can be more than just a showpiece. She is fluent in German and is ultimately used as a translator, essential to the codebreaking process.Beth is a quiet, timid young woman who has lived with her parents and has always been put down by her mother. Taught that she had no value, wasn’t good at anything, not even allowed to finish school. But she has a gift for mathematics and puzzle solving and at Bletchley Circle she finds her niche. She becomes one of the top cryptanalysts and is heads above everyone else she works with. She will find her wings here.Besides all of the intricacies of Bletchley park, all of the secrets that these people are sworn to keep, there is a resounding story of friendship, love and humor. All of those that work here, many for 24 hours straight, find their ways to have fun. They sing, they laugh, they find love and acceptance, all combined in the effort to help win the war for the Allies.This is a bare outline of the characters but there is lots of interaction between these three women, they become best friends, until tragedy strikes. They then are split apart for many years.’We flash ahead to 1947 and Beth is locked away in an asylum, thought to have “had a breakdown”. In reality she has been unjustly accused and knows a terrible secret -- there was a traitor at Bletchley park and she knows who it is. This is the one who put her here, and there are only two people whom she trusts can help her escape the asylum -- Mab and Osla!!These three indomitable women will come together once again to capture the spy who traded their security, the future of the war effort and love of country, for money. I’ll leave you to discover who the traitor was and how the story unfolds, just like looking down at the spirals inside a rose!!This is by far the best historical fiction I have read in a very long time! The last sections of the book are tense, action packed and will have you reading with all of your senses on high alert!If you enjoy this book I recommend watching the PBS series Bletchley Circle and here is also a link to an interview with Kate Quinn below. https://historicalfictionreader.blogs...I highly recommend this novel to all lovers of historical fiction, you will find a wonderful novel based on facts. You won’t easily forget these characters, they will stay with me for a long time.This was a buddy read with my good friend CeeCee who also loved the novel.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.This novel is set to release on March 9, 2021","The Rose Code: A Novel by Kate Quinn (Author), Saskia Maarleveld (Narrator)This is my second audio historical novel in a row and both of them were riveting. I can't help wondering if I'd feel differently about an audiobook if I had read it instead. Sometimes the narrators are so good, it's hard to imagine not hearing all those character voices, if I had read the book. The Rose Code deals with two time periods, the first starting in 1940 and the second taking place in November 1947. In 1940 three women come together and become the closest of friends because of their work and because they board in the same house/room. These three women are recruited to work as female codebreakers at Bletchley Park and the women are tied together by the secrecy of their work, knowing the Official Secrets Act of 1939 prevents them from speaking to anyone of what they do. A 1942 security warning emphasized the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: ""Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your hut."" The very need for such secrecy throws these three women into friendship as nothing else could do. Wealthy debutante Osla is seriously flirting with Prince Philip of Greece, hard, bold Mab has pulled herself up by her bootstraps to give herself an education and the ability to support herself, her mother, and her little sister, and then there is brilliant but shy, cowed Beth, whose mother has demeaned her so much that she thinks she is dumb and worthless. These women are each doing jobs that are part of the entire network that decodes enemy messages, messages that can change the tide of the war, mean saving the lives of thousands, heading off more disastrous losses, and determining if our side has managed to mislead the enemy from the inside. Personal disaster tears these women apart several years after they meet and they would never speak to each other again except that one of the women gets a message to the other two women that there was and still is a spy in their former codebreaking group. Against almost impossible odds, the women need to get back together to break one last code. The tension was high during their codebreaking days, in an exhausting, tedious, mind numbing way and now they will have to condense their years of work into days or their chance to stop a spy will be gone. I'd known about this work from seeing The Imitation Game and from research I'd done on Bletchley Park and I'm glad I had that background because I know it helped me to enjoy this book better than I might if I'd come in with no understanding of the work. I was wrapped up in this long audiobook, interested in not only Osla, Mab, and Beth but the secondary characters, too. This story has me wanting to learn even more about this work and this time and I'm going to have a hard time letting go of the characters. Pub: March 9th 2021Thank you to Harper Audio and NetGalley for this ARC.","""Welcome to BP""
I'm a bit surprised at myself for giving this one 5-stars... When a book gets a perfect rating from me, it's usually easy to pinpoint why, and that reason is, almost always, there is one exceptional thing working out for the book. But with Rose Code, it's everything from complex, mysterious, thrilling nature of the plot, beautiful writing to fascinating characters. This is one the most complete books I've read recently. Typically, I wouldn't've preferred for such a book to be this lengthy, but Rose Code kept me going quite easily till the end.
""Three girls and a book - that was how it all began.""
This is the first time I'm reading a book by Kate Quinn, and if this is any indication as to how she usually writes her characters, she is going to easily become one of my favorite authors. The three protagonists are some of the fascinating main characters I've come across in a modern book, and the author develops them in a seemingly effortless manner. They are a very realistic trio, each with distinct positive and negative attributes, making all the interactions colorful. The plot is a unique, mysterious storyline about a WW-II military intelligence camp, with plenty of twists to keep the reader captivated throughout the book. But like I said before, it's not just a single thing that is remarkable about this book. It's a concoction of so many great things.
""You had to respect a woman who could yawn with her mouth closed.""
Quinn users two timelines for the majority of the book, present and some years back during WW-II. The present timeline is being used to establish a unique flow to the story, while the latter narrates the entire backstory, from the point where out main characters get acquainted for the first time. There's just something about the author's story telling which makes the flow of story very natural. The immersiveness starts from the very first page, and you will not have any peace until you make it to the finish. Highly recommended for fans of historical fiction.
""A good university didn't mean a good man."""
The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,James   McBride,3.93,"James McBride is an accomplished saxophonist/jazz musician. I knew that going into the book. (Oh, digression--did you know that he also played with the band, The Remainders? That’s a band with other writers like Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King, Maya Angelou and several others who played for charity and fundraising). Anyway, I mention his musicianship because I see it all over the pages of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store. This is the first book I’ve read by McBride (definitely more to come), so pardon my schoolgirlish, giggly first crush for the way that his writing lifts me up, how his words and characters opened my heart, only to break it, and then put it back together in a most absolute and tender way. James McBride is a kind, gentle soul, and his writing reflects this—his ability to bring the world together in a novel. He honors humanity. We are all connected, and this author compels that naturally from his characters. Now, how great is that, yeah?I want to put this in your hands and promise you a magnificent reading experience. It starts off in a shaggy dog kind of way, with an ensemble of characters, several who possess whimsical names like Fatty, Big Soap, Monkey Pants, Dodo. And their names fit flawlessly to their nature. The story starts with a 1972 prologue—a human skeleton is found in an old abandoned well, and then the body of the story begins in 1936 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a place called Chicken Hill, where Jews, immigrants, and Black folks lived side by side, sometimes in harmony, other times in discord, but here’s the thing—the goodness of people, the kindness of their hearts—that is what ultimately rises to the top. For the story to unfold, there has to be some sinister aspects, too—aren’t we still fighting the fight of ignorance, bigotry, corruption, meanness? But, in the McBride world, well, we also follow the long stretch of yarn as it wends around this way and that, through streets and backyards, dirt roads, onto hills and a shul and a church, through tunnels and a dance hall. And The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.I don’t need to rehash the plot, but there are a few fun facts about this book worth mentioning in a review. Such as, there are an abundance of characters introduced early on, and then again later on, before the plot actually launches. That’s the shaggy part. We don’t get to the plot too quickly—instead, Mcbride takes his time, builds the characters. They are already leaping off the pages by the time the plot rolls in. There are subplots, too, but in the end, they all weave their chords and come together. McBride may slow your roll at first, but it’s a winning bonanza of breadth and depth, from the smallest detail to the broadest design. Scenes that seem initially inconsequential become key notes later on. Early on, we meet the arresting Jewess, Chona. Chona is an unforgettable female protagonist—I’m keeping her in my journal of best. female. characters. ever. She is handicapped with a limp—but her limp doesn’t stop her strength of purpose, her fierce dignity, her bounteous benevolence, her gentle grace, and her consummate integrity. You will fall in love with her, just like Moshe, the theater and dance hall owner, did. Moshe and Chona dared to welcome change and inclusivity to their part of the world. At this time, in the 1930s, Black people were almost exclusively cast in menial jobs. But Moshe books Black jazz bands to play at his theater, and successfully includes all tribes together at the dance hall, who “frolicked and laughed, dancing as if they were birds enjoying flight for the first time.” Chona runs the grocery store, and extends credit to anyone who can’t afford to pay; she rarely keeps a record of their debt. The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store may lose money, but it is rich in goodwill and kindness.Back to this being like a musical book—a jazzy book. Jazz music conjures that raspy, soulful, edgy flavor, blended from a mix of cultures and harmonies. McBride embraces those diverse, insistent, zingy, soul-stirring rhythms and blues into the narrative threads of his novel. I can hear the swing and the chase, the boogie and the blues, the sounds that go everywhere at once and jelly roll the story within a complex set of fusion and feelings. It’s also just a damned good story!The narrative pulls you here and there, up and down, and when you meet Dodo, the sweet and barely teenaged deaf kid, your protective instincts will wrap yourself around him and never want to let him go. And, when Dodo meets Monkey Pants—well, this right there—the heart of the novel that will break you in pieces. At times, I had a wellspring of tears—not just for joy or anguish. Sure, comedy and tragedy fill these pages. But McBride’s natural humanity and gentle nature is the colossal, phenomenal heart of the book. The author steps aside, he doesn’t ever intrude. The core of the narrative are the characters. Their cacophony becomes a coda for living large.This tale made me want to be better, to do better, to open my eyes to all the missed connections, to fix the broken chords and forge new ones, and seek eternally to strengthen them. We are humanity, we are the essential substance to add love to the world, one modest good deed at a time. That is The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.","So this was...not very good.This is going to be another of those reviews where I open by saying I'm having a hard time articulating exactly what didn't work for me because on the surface it seems like this should be a tour de force. All the ""classic novel"" ingredients are here. But, having thought about it a bit I think that's the problem. The ingredients are here but nobody put them together very well.The story, when there is one, begins in the ruins of Chicken Hill, a neighborhood in Pottstown, PA that was once home to a vibrant community of Jews and African Americans who lived and worked together, striving to build lives in a world that was happy to use their labor and ingenuity as long as they remembered their place. Its the late 70's and following a hurricane most of Chicken Hill has been wiped off the map and in the ruins the police have discovered a man's skeletal remains. But who he is and why his bony hand was clutching a strange necklace is a mystery the police are unable to solve. Its also a mystery I completely forgot about in this overstuffed, meandering narrative that takes pages and pages and pages to go absolutely nowhere. James McBride is a beautiful writer. I mean that sincerely. But all the beautiful writing in the world can't make up for the endless parade of side plots and random character introductions that take the place of an actual coherent story.Nothing happens in this book. It is positively maddening and very, very strange.We're presented with a mystery; whose is the skeleton uncovered after the storm? Then for about 380 pages we are introduced to character after character after character who all have adorable folksy names and charming, convoluted, ""hilarious"" backstories that involve star crossed romance, traumatic family histories, or hair brained schemes that resulted in the weird nickname they now have or the strange limp they're walking with and it just goes on and on and on until I thought I was gonna scream. Then at around the 380 page mark McBride suddenly remembered the original plot and wraps everything up. There's also a startling lack of setting for a book that feels like it should be a very visceral reading experience. The idea of the Heaven and Earth Grocery Store is, I think, intended to be sort of the corner stone of the book. Its a store run by a Jewish woman who's sort of the ""heart"" of Chicken Hill. There's a lot of talk among other characters about how great she is but the reader never actually sees anything great happen. We also never really see the store, or Chicken Hill for that matter. Everything feels weirdly formless and void. There just isn't a strong sense of place at all. I couldn't tell you what anything looked like in this book.I feel like this book had absolutely no editor or guiding hand of any kind saying ""James I love what you're doing but you don't need forty supporting characters and they don't all need their own fifteen page origin stories.""I can't for the life of me work out what everyone else is seeing in this book that I'm missing.","Unpopular opinion here, but I just couldn't get into this book. I put it down several times and finishing it felt like a chore. There were too many characters and subplots that went nowhere. At the end this was a mishmash of opportunities that took pages and pages and pages to go absolutely nowhere."

""In the end, the monster we feared didn’t come from Hell. He came from privilege.""

Oh, this review is going to be a wild ride. The range of things I feel for this book is very unreal. Listen, the atmosphere of this? The settings? The premise? I couldn’t get enough. Dare I even say close to perfect? And the plot had me so very invested in every single way. But this actual story and the plot conveniences, the characters and their lack of critical thinking, the obvious plot twists? The Lord might be testing me. The whiplash I felt while reading this was a full experience and deserves a star rating of its own, truly.When you open this book for the first time, the prologue will transport you to a stormy night in 19th century Italy, where two little twin girls are being gifted very special necklaces while slowly learning their witch powers and history from their grandmother. There are seven demon princes but only 4 the witches should fear, but somehow their necklaces will keep them safe, even though they are instructed to never place them together.

""One will crave your blood. One will capture your heart. One will steal your soul. And one will take your life.""

Then the story actually takes place ten years in the future, where Emilia and Vittoria are now eighteen-years-old, but we see how that night has shaped their lives for the last decade in so many different ways, but for sure centering on those necklaces that were entrusted to them. Both girls are trying to help their family with their restaurant, find and follow their dreams, and lead normal lives, but they soon find out that normal and safe and happy was never in the cards for them.Again, I do not want to give much away, because I think I very much benefited from not reading the synopsis of this story. But the gates of hell are weakening, and their city and family are no longer safe. Not only do they have to worry about hiding the fact that they are witches, but now they have to worry about demon princes, witch hunters, and other creatures that go bump in the night! But Emilia is thrust in the heart of it all, with her witchcraft on full display, when she makes a deal with a demon when she is most desperate.Together, Emilia and Wrath (be still, my BDB heart) are forced to work together to investigate brutal and mysterious murders that are happening, but they are both looking for clues for very different reasons. My favorite part of this book was truly going alongside Emilia and seeing all these different settings. From secret casinos, to her family’s kitchen, surprise palaces, spooky beaches, to the scary and dark corridors within the church, I couldn’t get enough of all the different adventures in all the different places.

""Grief carved me in half. And fury honed the pieces into a weapon.""

I really loved the depiction of grief and depression in this book, too. How the weight of sadness can be unbearable, especially alone, when your world and future are taken from you right before your eyes. I also think Kerri Maniscalco did a really good job portraying not only the different stages that can be held within grief, but to also tell the reader that there is truly no wrong way to grieve. Heartbreak can be sadness and pain, but it can also be anger and revenge.I also did really enjoy the romance and I think if you are looking to indulge in a new OTP that will remind you of 2015 then you are in luck with this one! I did enjoy Wrath a lot more than Emilia for the most part, but I feel like the plot convenience (and Emilia acting stupid) was the downfall of this book. I am not good at unraveling mysteries, but I truly unraveled this one instantly, I only wish Emilia could have a little sooner and it made the reading experience a bit annoying. Also, she gets upset at the strangest things, and wholeheartedly accepts the wildest things for no reason. I truly feel like her character was mostly used to move the book along conveniently instead of actually making her feel like a main character with depth and identity.Also, I’m just going to say it, the grandmother in this book is one of the most infuriating characters I’ve read about all 2020. Like, regardless of prophecies, how are you going to be this mysterious with eight-year-old little girls and then really not fill them in on any blanks for the next ten years of their lives too? The grandma is really written to look like this cool and wise character who helps save the day, but I truly could not stand her or her shocked reaction when things would fall apart around her.On top of the mysteries in this book being a bit of a letdown, I will also say that I felt like so many big events in this book kind of happened just for (hopefully) set ups for the next installment. I’m all for setting up things in early books, but it just kind of feels bad when absolutely nothing happens regarding these big chapters after the scene has ended. I feel like if this book felt more cohesive throughout, instead of just setting up for what is to come, I would have gotten so much of a higher rating from me, but I have to rate and review off the material that is given to me and it made for a bit of an infuriating reading experience.

""Man had a funny way of blaming the devil for things he didn’t like.""

Overall, I couldn’t put this book down. Truly. And I would bet you a great sum of money that I will also pick up the next one, because this book ended on a very perfect cliffhanger set up that I greedily want to know everything about. This book really did give me nostalgic feels for some reason, it made me very hungry most of the time, and it made me truly never want to put it down. The writing is so easily consumable, and I really did fall in love with the setting and plot set up. I only wish it felt a little bit more like a full story and not just a set up book. I still predict that this book will do really well, and I think most people will have a very good reading experience with this with.Trigger and Content Warnings: gore, violence, blood depiction, self-harm to get blood for spells, loss of a loved one, grief depiction, murder, death, brief mention of unwanted touching, and magical compulsion.Blog | Instagram | Youtube | Ko-fi | Spotify | Twitch Buddy read with Maëlys & Lea! ❤","2 stars for the interesting concept but poorly delivered narrative with a dumb main character whose only personality trait is being good at cooking. It would’ve been more fitting had this been marketed as a creative cookbook rather than YA fantasy.I’ll start with the world-building which was lackluster and quite lazy. We know this was set in Italy, but the time period was unclear. We never got fleshed-out descriptions of the buildings, the clothing, and the people. This was also one of those books that “tell” rather than “show”. Almost everything about the world was explained and introduced through dialogue such as Nonna’s stories and Wrath’s answers to Emilia’s questions. That would’ve been fine if I were invested enough in the story and characters to look past it, but I wasn’t. The different “Houses” weren’t developed either. If Maniscalco put as much effort into describing the world as she did for describing the food, the world-building would’ve been great and I wouldn’t have had to piece together information that I didn’t have.As for the plot, I just needed them to shut up and stop talking about food for the entirety of the book. It was almost as repetitive as the word “mate” in the ACOTAR series. Granted that the plot did pick up when we finally met Wrath, the bulk of it was still quite the snoozefest. The whole plot just fell flat. I was expecting this to be a well-developed enemies-to-lovers story with dark, witchy vibes that would get me hooked, but all I got was half a story with dark, witchy vibes where not a lot happened. The ending resolved absolutely nothing and left me confused, but I guess that sets us up for the next book which I know for sure I will not be reading because I just can't be bothered. I am thrilled to announce that this book will be the first addition to my new collection of “books to read before bed so I can fall asleep in less than 30 seconds.”Moving on to the characters. Emilia was boring, annoying, and reckless. It bothered me how she almost always managed to get away rather unscathed despite her recklessness. It also seemed as though everything clicked too quickly with the clues she found. Emilia didn’t even really have to try for anything and everything was way too easy; there was little conflict between plot points. Wrath was the only character that was at least a little bit entertaining to me, however, he was a pathetic manifestation of a sin. One would expect the Prince of Wrath and War to be wrathful or warlike, but he was neither. Instead, he was just a generic “hot, dark and broody” love interest who actually didn’t have much of a personality and was also quite the bore like Emilia. Gotta love how they match each other’s energies, I guess. As for the Wicked, they should’ve been terrifying, but were all relatively weak and easily defeated. It also seemed like they were placed in random events throughout the story—especially in the beginning—just for the shock factor.Overall, this book felt rushed and drawn out at the same time. While the idea of the book is good, the execution was not. The plot was undefined and scattered much like the characters. Although I complained about the overwhelming amount of times that food was mentioned, the food still had more personality than the actual characters. This book is the epitome of wasted potential and I can’t wait to read another book so I can purge this one out of my head!","I’m in pain! I’m dying to learn what’s gonna happen next! Arggggggggkkkk! Yes, if you google “drunk and angry damsel in distress”, you may see my bloody face right now! I just finished this fascinating, heart throbbing, riveting , addictive story and after reading the last words as like an addict I wanted to get more literature intake. I’m honestly craving for the next book now!  The things I fell hard for: A witch and a demon’s sizzling, pant melting chemistry : they’re like gasoline and fire! They will be end of each other! Yes, Emilia and Wrath (the name of the sin and household he represents, we still don’t know his real name so we gotta wait for the next book) are one of the hottest couple with undeniable amazing chemistry you enjoy to read. A serial killer theme who is targeting the witches: The killer’s one of the victims is unfortunately the twin sister Vittoria of our heroine and narrator Emilia! The Sicilian trattoria and those mouth watering recipes Emilia’s family shares and cooks during the book: OMG! I already ate three cannolis and barely hold myself to say the catchy famous quote: “keep the gun, take the cannoli!” Emilia’s family own this special family trattoria and they cook ancient Italian meals with pouring their skillful art and magical power into them! Creative world building: 7 deadly sins represent different households of hell and those 7 princess can travel through different realms. After Wrath, it seems like Lust is my favorite sinful prince! Enemies to reluctant partners theme: after losing her twin sister, Emilia wants to find out the perpetrator by deciphering the dark magic spell her sister put at her diary. As soon as she realizes her sister summoned an evil, she followed the same way but as soon as hot as hell, charismatic, coolest evil Wrath appears, she finds at their bound is more intense and eternal that she’d ever imagined. Quick summary: A serial killer targeting witches. Emilia seems like more introvert, book smart, obedient girl of the family as her adventurous, bold, brave, straightforward twin Vittoria completely opposite of her. But after her sister is murdered, she turns into vengeful, angry, hot blooded witch who stops being cautious, getting more risks including summoning a demon and letting him be her partner to find the identity of the killer who is responsible from those murders. But this means one of the seven evil princes must be behind those vicious crimes! The cliffhanger at the end makes you jumpy because you want to know what’s gonna happen next immediately! Well, I cannot wait to read the next book! I’m already sold! This is such a great start for the series! Special thanks to NetGalley and JIMMY PATTERSON for sharing this digital review copy with me in exchange my honest opinions. I loved it so much!!!"
The Book Thief,Markus Zusak,4.39,"Just to clarify: Yes, I did cry.I've read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book. I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.Quick test to see if you'll like this book:1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?3. Do you like words?(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).So, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.Two incidents set me off lately.1.	My neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.2.	I was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you’ve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let’s just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he’d said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it’s about time “somebody did something”. (Fuck me, I’ve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they’re referring to? Do they actually know? I’ve yet to hear them pronounce what this “something” is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I’m not aware of that they’re referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)To my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven’t really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven’t spoken to her since.The Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn’t even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn’t spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.Instead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren’t really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we’d never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They’re not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they’re still poor. They’re the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they’re not the good guys either. They don’t speak up for the Jewish people, they don’t try to change popular opinion, they don’t stand for what’s right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.So you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I’m one of the “good guys” when I don’t stand up for people either? Shouldn’t I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn’t I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn’t I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn’t I have asked her why she’s spreading propaganda? Couldn’t I have probed her to think critically about this man’s claims, about facts and ethics? No. I didn’t want to cause problems and I didn’t want to make waves.The narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler’s took over a country and started a war – not with guns or weapons but with words. I’ve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him. When I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don’t fill a child’s head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It’s kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.Well, I agree. When you don’t educate people, when you don’t teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future – a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be – and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet. Coincidently when you don’t speak up, when you don’t proclaim the truth, when you’re too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you’re no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can’t imagine how my friends would feel if they’d known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine – and rightfully so.And now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn’t like this book – the narrator.The Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn’t feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we’re all guilty – and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there’s a sense that we’re all going down together. When we’re damned, at least we’ll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment. I don’t mind being stripped down. I don’t mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story. I loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights. For some reason, that thought makes me very happy.","THE BOOK THIEF: A Summary. Liesel: Hi, I'm Liesel. I have no personality, but I'm a cute little girl. Death: Her name is not Liesel. Her name is THE BOOK THIEF and I shall name her that for the rest of the book.Liesel: Even though I stole, like, 3 books in total or something. Death: Shut up, Book Thief.Rudy: Hello everyone. Have you ever seen a lemon? That's what my hair looks like. Death: Here is a little information you should know: this books is filled with many interesting facts. Very relevant and everything. We shall kick off with the definition from the dictionary of the word lemon. Reader: The fuck? Death: A lemon is a vegetable that is very yellow and acid. That's what the Book Thief's friend's hair looks like.Reader: That's not a very good description. That's how I picture Rudy now. 

Death: Shut up and read so you can cry, reader.*Intimidated reader keeps on reading*Liesel: Papa!Papa: Liesel. Death: Reader, are you crying yet?Reader: Can you just stop that?Death: What?Reader: That. Popping up out of nowhere? Death: Get used to it. And keep on reading before I killz you!

Death: Listen, reader. Saukerl means bitch, basically, but I suppose it's less brutal if they say it in German. HERE IS ANOTHER LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW: A lot of random words will be in German for the sole purpose of making this book look smart and bilingual. But it really is useless as every, and I do mean EVERY word in German is immediately followed by the English translation.Reader: Errrr. What's the point then? Death: Who said it has to be useful? I bet you're one of those ridiculous people who thinks a book has to have a plot? Or that characters have to be multi-dimensional? And you probably think that two metaphors per sentence is too much? Well, YOU ARE WRONG. This book will show you exactly how wrong you are.Reader: Uh. Why did I pick up this book again?Death: Because everyone luurved it. And you will, too.*Skeptical reader keeps on reading*Liesel: Papa!Papa: Liesel. Liesel: Mama!Mama: Shut the fuck up, you slut bitch cunt fucking whore. Liesel: Okayyy.

Death: This is an information you should know: This was Nazi Germany and A BOOK WAS SOON TO BE STOLEN.Liesel: Oh, a book. That's nice. Death: SEE? IT IS NAZI GERMANY AND YET IT IS FULL OF BOOK THIEVERY.Reader: Can you just stop glorifying book thievery? It's not that impressive. You make me expect something huge and it's not. So okay, she stole a book. BIG DEAL! It's not that amazing. Stop acting like it is.Death: *glares*Liesel: Papa?Papa: Yes, Liesel? Liesel: Can you read this book for me?Papa: Yes. *They read and everyone else is bored.* Mama: Hey, you fucking punk ass motherfucking slut, dinner's ready!Liesel: Coming, Mommy.Reader: THE FUCK?Death: Here are two informations that you should know. First, the definition from the dictionary of the word Dinner. Dinner is the main meal of the day, eaten in the evening or at midday. ...Reader: This is a joke, right? What's the second information?Death: A JEW IS COMING YOYOYO.Reader: Thanks. I love to be surprised, so it's pretty cool to see how you spoil EVERYTHING. And practically nothing happens in the first place, so everything that COULD make me care for the book is now ruined. Max: Hello, everyone. I am sweet and cliché and nice and Jewish.

I will tell you how it ends.Death: Everyone is gonna DIE. Now there, take this bucket. Fill it with tears. Go on, cry.Reader: But there are still 532832 pages left!

Everyone is just so fucking relieved.*","This is a book to treasure, a new classic. I absolutely loved it.Set in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel, narrated by Death who has in his possession the book she wrote about these years. So, in a way, they are both book thieves. Liesel steals randomly at first, and later more methodically, but she's never greedy. Death pockets Liesel's notebook after she leaves it, forgotten in her grief, amongst the destruction that was once her street, her home, and carries it with him.Liesel is effectively an orphan. She never knew her father, her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents, and her younger brother died on the train to Molching where the foster parents live. Death first encounters nine-year-old Liesel when her brother dies, and hangs around long enough to watch her steal her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, left lying in the snow by her brother's grave.Her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Herbermann, are poor Germans given a small allowance to take her in. Hans, a tall, quiet man with silver eyes, is a painter (of houses etc.) and plays the accordian. He teaches Liesel how to read and write. Rosa is gruff and swears a lot but has a big heart, and does laundry for rich people in the town. Liesel becomes best friends with her neighbour Rudy, a boy with ""hair the colour of lemons"" who idolises the black Olympic champion sprinter Jesse Owens. One night a Jew turns up in their home. He's the son of a friend of Hans from the first world war, the man who taught him the accordian, whose widowed wife Hans promised to help if she ever needed it. Hans is a German who does not hate Jews, though he knows the risk he and his family are taking, letting Max live in the basement. Max and Liesel become close friends, and he writes an absolutely beautiful story for her, called The Standover Man, which damn near broke my heart. It's the story of Max, growing up and coming to Liesel's home, and it's painted over white-painted pages of Mein Kampf, which you can see through the paint.Whenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With The Book Thief, Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. His writing is lyrical, haunting, poetic, profound. Death is rendered vividly, a lonely, haunted being who is drawn to children, who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder at it. Liesel is very real, a child living a child's life of soccer in the street, stolen pleasures, sudden passions and a full heart while around her bombs drop, maimed veterans hang themselves, bereaved parents move like ghosts, Gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of Jews are paraded through the town.Many things save this book from being all-out depressing. It's never morbid, for a start. A lively humour dances through the pages, and the richness of the descriptions as well as the richness of the characters' hearts cannot fail to lift you up. Also, it's great to read such a balanced story, where ordinary Germans - even those who are blond and blue-eyed - are as much at risk of losing their lives, of being persecuted, as the Jews themselves.I can't go any further without talking about the writing itself. From the very first title page, you know you're in for something very special indeed. The only way to really show you what I mean is to select a few quotes (and I wish I was better at keeping track of lines I love).""As he looked uncomfortably at the human shape before him, the young man's voice was scraped out and handed across the dark like it was all that remained of him."" (p187) ""Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew."" (p.239)""The book was released gloriously from his hand. It opened and flapped, the pages rattling as it covered ground in the air. More abruptly than expected, it stopped and appeared to be sucked towards the water. It clapped when it hit the surface and began to float downstream."" (p.325)""So many humans. So many colours. They keep triggering inside me. They harass my memory. I see them tall in their heaps, all mounted on top of each other. There is air like plastic, a horizon like setting glue. There are skies manufactured by people, punctured and leaking, and there are soft, coal-coloured clouds, beating, like black hearts. And then. There is death. Making his way through all of it. On the surface: unflappable, unwavering. Below: unnerved, untied, and undone."" (p.331)""After ten minutes or so, what was most prominent in the cellar was a kind of non-movement. Their bodies were welded together and only their feet changed position or pressure. Stillness was shackled to their faces. They watched each other and waited."" (p.402)""People and Jews and clouds all stopped. They watched. As he stood, Max looked first at the girl and then stared directly into the sky who was wide and blue and magnificent. There were heavy beams - planks of sun - falling randomly, wonderfully, onto the road. Clouds arched their backs to look behind as they started again to move on. ""It's such a beautiful day,"" he said, and his voice was in many pieces. A great day to die. A great day to die, like this."" (pp.543-4)Writing like this is not something just anyone can do: it's true art. Only a writer of Zusak's talent could make this story work, and coud get away with such a proliferation of adjectives and adverbs, to write in such a way as to revitalise the language and use words to paint emotion and a vivid visual landscape in a way you'd never before encountered. This is a book about the power of words and language, and it is fitting that it is written in just such this way. The way this book was written also makes me think of a musical, or an elaborate, flamboyant stage-play. It's in the title pages for each part, in Death's asides and manner of emphasing little details or even speech, in the way Death narrates, giving us the ending at the beginning, giving little melodrammatic pronouncements that make you shiver. It's probably the first book I've read that makes me feel how I feel watching The Phantom of the Opera, if that helps explain it.And it made me cry."
All the Light We Cannot See,Anthony Doerr,4.31,"4/20/15 - PULITZER WINNER for 2014

 The brain is locked in total darkness of course, children, says the voice. It floats in a clear liquid inside the skull, never in the light. And yet the world it constructs in the mind is full of light. It brims with color and movement. So how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?

Marie Laure LeBlanc is a teen who had gone blind at age 6. She and her father, Daniel, fled Paris ahead of the German invasion, arriving in the ancient walled port city of Saint Malo in northwest France to stay with M-L’s great uncle, Etienne. His PTSD from WW I had kept him indoors for two decades. They bring with them a large and infamous diamond, to save it from the Nazis. Daniel had made a scale model of their neighborhood in Paris to help young Marie Laure learn her away around, and repeats the project in Saint Malo, which is eventually occupied by the German army.Werner and Jutta Pfennig are raised in a German orphanage after their father is killed in the local mine. Werner has a gift for electronics, and is sent to a special school where, despite the many horrors of the experience, his talent is nurtured. He develops technology for locating radio sources, and is rushed into the Wehrmacht to apply his skill in the war. His assignment brings him to Saint Malo, where his path and Marie Laure’s intersect. Anthony Doerr There are three primary time streams here, 1944 as the Allies are assaulting the German-held town, 1940-44, as we follow the progress of Werner and Marie Laure to their intersection, and the 1930s. We see the boy and the girl as children, and are presented with mirrored events in their young lives that will define in large measure the years to follow. Werner and Jutta are mesmerized by a French radio broadcast, a respite from the anti-Semitic propaganda the government is broadcasting. The Professor in the French broadcast offers lectures on science, and inspires Werner to dream of a life beyond the orphanage. 
Open your eyes, concluded the man, and see what you can with them before they close forever,  and then a piano comes on, playing a lonely song that sounds to Werner like a golden boat traveling a dark river, a progression of harmonies that transfigures Zollverein: the houses turned to mist, the mines filled in, the smokestacks fallen, an ancient sea spilling through the streets, and the air streaming with possibility.
As her father is the head locksmith for the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, Marie Laure has the run of the place. She spends a lot of time with a professor there, learning everything she can about shells, mollusks and snails.
Dr. Geffard teaches her the names of shells--Lambis lambis, Cypraea moneta, Lophiotoma acuta--and lets her feel the spines and apertures and whorls of each in turn. He explains the branches of marine evolution and the sequences of the geologic periods; on her best days, she glimpses the limitless span of millennia behind her: millions of years, tens of millions of years.
Both Werner and Marie Laure are enriched by teachers and books as they grow. No nuclear families here. Marie Laure’s mother died in childbirth. The Pfennig children lost their remaining parent when father was killed in the mine. The author, in a video on his site, talks about the three pieces of inspiration that provided the superstructure for the novel. While 80 feet below ground in a NYC subway, a fellow passenger was griping about the loss of cell service. Doerr appreciates the beautiful miracle that is modern communications.  At the start of the book I wanted to try to capture the magic of hearing the voice of a stranger in a little device in your home because for the history of humanity, that was a strange thing. I started with a boy trapped somewhere and a girl reading a story. A year later he was on a book tour in France and saw Saint Malo for the first time. Walking around this beautiful seaside town, a walled fortress, the beautiful channel, the green water of the channel breaking against the walls and I told my editor, “look how old this is. This medieval town’s so pretty.” He said, “actually, this town was almost entirely destroyed in 1944, by your country, by American bombs.” So I started researching a lot about the city of Saint Malo immediately and knew that was the setting. That was where the boy would be trapped, listening to the radio. The third piece arrived when Doerr learned that when the Germans invaded, the French hid not only their artistic treasures but their important natural history and gemological holdings as well.The story is told primarily in alternating Marie Laure’s and Werner’s experiences. But there is a third stream as well, that of Sgt Major Reinhold von Rumpel, a gem appraiser drafted by the Reich to examine the jewels captured by the military and collect the best for a special collection. He becomes obsessed with finding the Sea of Flames, the near mythic diamond Daniel LeBlanc had hidden away. He is pretty much the prototypical evil Nazi, completely corrupt, greedy, cruel, as close to a stick-figure characterization as there is in the book. But his evil-doing provides the danger needed to move the story forward. There may not be words sufficient to exclaim just how magnificent an accomplishment this book is. Amazing, spectacular, incredible, moving, engaging, emotional, gripping, celestial, soulful, and bloody fracking brilliant might give some indication. There is so much going on here. One can read it for the story alone and come away satisfied. But there is such amazing craft on display that the book rewards a closer reading. In addition to a deft application of mirroring in the experiences of Werner and Marie Laure, Doerr brings a poet’s sense of imagery and magic. Marie-Laure’s sense of the world is filled with shell, snail, and mollusk experiences and references. Some are simple. During a time of intense stress, she must live like the snails, moment to moment, centimeter to centimeter. In a moment of hopeful reflection,  these tiny wet beings straining calcium from the water and spinning it into polished dreams on their backs—it is enough. More than enough. You will find many more scattered about like you-know-what on a beach.  I knew early on that I wanted her to be interested in shells. I'm standing here at the ocean right now. I've always been so interested in both the visual beauty of mollusks and the tactile feel of them. As a kid, I collected them all the time. That really imbued both ""The Shell Collector"" and Marie with, Why does the natural world bother to be so beautiful? For me, that's really embodied in seashells. I knew early on that I wanted her to find a path to pursue her interest in shells. I think that fits — I hope that fits — with visual impairment, using your fingers to identify them and admire them. - from the Powell’s reviewWerner’s snowy white hair alone might stand in for the entirety of the visible spectrum. (although it is described as “a color that is the absence of color.”) The dreaded prospect of being forced to work in the mines in a literally coal-black environment, the very antithesis of light, offers motivation for Werner to find another path, and coal itself offers a balance for that other form of carbon that drives Marie Laure’s father out of Paris, the one that embodies light. While black and white are often used in describing Werner’s environment, the broader spectrum figures large in his descriptions.
Werner liked to crouch in his dormer and imagine radio waves like mile-long harp strings, bending and vibrating over Zollverein, flying through forests, through cities, through walls. At midnight he and Jutta prowl the ionosphere, searching for that lavish, penetrating voice. When they find it, Werner feels as if he has been launched into a different existence, a secret place where great discoveries are possible, where an orphan from a coal town can solve some vital mystery hidden in the physical world.
A nice additional touch is Marie Laure’s reading of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It permeates the tale as her reading echoes events and tensions in the real world of the story. Also avian imagery is a frequent, soulful presence. A particularly moving moment is when a damaged character is reminded of a long-lost friend (or maybe a long-remembered fear?) by the presence of a particular bird associated with that friend and the time when they knew each other.There are substantive issues addressed in this National Book Award finalist. Moral choices must be made about how to respond when darkness seeks to extinguish the light. There are powerful instances in which different characters withdraw into their shells in response to evil, but others in which they rage against the night with their actions. Thoughtful characters question the morality of their actions, as dark-siders plunge into the moral abyss. Sometimes the plunge is steep and immediate, but for others it is made clear that innocence can be corrupted, bit by bit. The major characters, and a few of the secondary ones, are very well drawn. You will most definitely care what happens to them.As for gripes, few and far between. There is a tendency at times to tell rather than show. Marie Laure may be too good. That’s about it. There are sure to be some who find this story too emotional. I am not among them.Just as Werner perceives or imagines he perceives an invisible world of radiowaves, All the Light We Cannot See enriches the reader with a spectrum of imagery, of meaning, of feeling. You may need eyes to read the page, ears to hear if listening to an audio version, or sensitive, educated fingers to read a Braille volume (please tell me this book has been published in Braille), but the waves with which Doerr has constructed his masterwork will permeate your reading experience. They may not be entirely apparent to your senses the first time you read this book. They are there. Whether you see, hear or touch them, or miss them entirely, they are there, and they will fill you. All the Light We Cannot See is a dazzling novel. When you read it, you will see.

It's brimming with metaphors, painting gorgeous images. I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't put it down. ""In August 1944 the historic walled city of Saint-Malo, the brightest jewel of the Emerald Coast of Brittany, France was almost destroyed by fire....Of the 865 buildings within the walls, only 182 remained standing and all were damaged to some degree."" -Philip Beck _____________________________________Two Parallel StoriesTwo parallel stories about two children during WWII, a young girl in France, a young boy in Germany.Story 1. Nazi Germany,In Nazi Germany, a young orphan boy named Werner lives in a sparse children’s home with his sister. He is exceptionally bright and curious with a knack for fixing electronics. After fixing an old radio he becomes spellbound by a nightly science program broadcast from France. His talents in math and science win him a coveted spot in a nightmarish Hitler Youth Academy. This is his only chance to escape from a grim, dead-end life working in the same deadly coal mines that killed his father so he enrolls in the school.Story 2. Paris, FranceIn Paris, France a shy, freckled redhead named Marie-Laure is intuitive, clever, and sensitive. She lives with her locksmith father who works at a local museum. When she goes blind from a degenerative disease at the age of six, her father builds her a detailed miniature model of their neighborhood so she can memorize every street, building, and corner by tracing the model with her nimble fingers. When the Germans attack Paris, she and her father flee to the coastal town of Saint-Malo to live with a great-uncle who lives in a tall, storied house next to a sea wall.What does the title mean? The author explains in his own words: ""The title is a reference first and foremost to all the light we literally cannot see: that is, the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are beyond the ability of human eyes to detect (radio waves, of course, being the most relevant). It’s also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within World War II — that stories of ordinary children, for example, are a kind of light we do not typically see. Ultimately, the title is intended as a suggestion that we spend too much time focused on only a small slice of the spectrum of possibility."" - Anthony Doerr A damaged World War II bunker turret in Saint-MaloQuote from page 509:“A foot of steel looks as if it has been transformed into warm butter and gouged by the fingers of a child”  Photos of Saint-Malo with quotes from the first few pages of this book: Quote from Page 3: ""At dusk they pour from the sky. They blow across the ramparts, turn cartwheels over rooftops, ﬂutter into the ravines between houses. Entire streets swirl with them, ﬂashing white against the cobbles. ""Urgent message to the inhabitants of this town,"" they say. ""Depart immediately to open country."" The tide climbs. The moon hangs small and yellow and gibbous. On the rooftops of beachfront hotels to the east, and in the gardens behind them, a half-dozen American artillery units drop incendiary rounds into the mouths of mortars.""Quote from Page 11: ""Saint Malo: Water surrounds the city on four sides. Its link to the rest of France is tenuous: a causeway, a bridge, a spit of sand. We are Malouins ﬁrst, say the people of Saint-Malo. Bretons next. French if there’s anything left over. In stormy light, its granite glows blue. At the highest tides, the sea creeps into basements at the very center of town. At the lowest tides, the barnacled ribs of a thousand shipwrecks stick out above the sea. For three thousand years, this little promontory has known sieges. But never like this.""Quote from Page 5: ""The GirlIn a corner of the city, inside a tall, narrow house at Number 4 rue Vauborel, on the sixth and highest ﬂoor, a sightless sixteen-year-old named Marie-Laure LeBlanc kneels over a low table covered entirely with a model. The model is a miniature of the city she kneels within, and contains scale replicas of the hundreds of houses and shops and hotels within its walls. There’s the cathedral with its perforated spire, and the bulky old Château de Saint-Malo, and row after row of sea-side mansions studded with chimneys. A slender wooden jetty arcs out from a beach called the Plage du Môle; a delicate, reticulated atrium vaults over the seafood market; minute benches, the smallest no larger than apple seeds, dot the tiny public squares.Marie-Laure runs her ﬁngertips along the centimeter-wide para-pet crowning the ramparts, drawing an uneven star shape around the entire model. She ﬁnds the opening atop the walls where four ceremonial cannons point to sea.""“Now it seems there are only shadows and silence. Silence is the fruit of the occupation; it hangs in branches, seeps from gutters…So many windows are dark. It’s as if the city has become a library of books in an unknown language, the houses great shelves of illegible volumes, the lamps all extinguished.” -- All The Light We cannot See","This is a carefully constructed book which is bound to captivate a large audience and become very popular, and be blessed with many warm reviews - it was chosen by Goodreads members as the best historical fiction of 2014, and shortlisted for the National Book Award. There are multiple reasons for its success - but they are also the same reasons as to why I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would.Anthony Doerr's All The Light We Cannot See follows the parallel lives of two protagonists - Marie-Laure, a French girl and daughter of a master locksmith at the Natural History Museum in Paris; the other character is Werner Pfenning, a German boy growing up in the mining town of Zollverein. Their lives are drawn against the brewing conflict, which will soon engulf not only France and Germany, but most of the world - the second World War.Both Marie and Werner are sympathetic character for whom the reader can root for - the author has made sure of that. Marie-Laure goes literally blind in the first or second chapter, and spends the beginning of the book becoming used to her new condition (mostly the help of her father, who designs elaborate puzzles for her to solve). Werner grows up in an industrial town hit by the depression, amidst the rise of the brownshirts; his only real companion is his sister, Jutta, and his only solace the radio - which Werner knows how to operate and fix instinctively, and to which they both listen at night.The Nazis eventually come to power and invade France, forcing Marie-Laure and her father to flee to the northern coastal town of Saint-Malo, an ancient walled city which provides picturesque setting for much of the book. In Germany, Werner's skill with the radio catches the eye of a Nazi official who sends him to the breeding ground for Nazi youth, where he will be trained to become a member of the military and eventually sent to the front. At the same time, a much older Nazi official searches all over France for an almost mythical diamond all over France, and is dedicated to finding it. Doerr's chapters are short and readable, and often contain pleasant nuggets of prose which was obviously carefully thought-out. To maintain suspense, he switches both between perspectives and time periods: various parts of the book are set in different years, mostly non-chronologically, and are comprised of chapters alternating between different characters. The trouble with the book is that it's not very compelling, surprising, or illuminating. With Doerr's outline for the story - three characters, three different viewpoints - we know that their stories will eventually collide, but when they finally do it happens in a quick, unsatisfying way. Doerr's characters lack moral complexity which would make them properly engaging - Marie Laure spends most of the book in hiding, which is understandable, but which also stops her from being forced to make important moral and ethical choices regarding her own survival. Werner is even more troubling - while he is troubled by brutality he witnesses at the Nazi school, he seems resigned to it. Werner neither openly embraces Nazism, nor condemns it - he's indifferent to the whole experience and role he plays. It's as if Doerr never gave Werner the opportunity to grow up, choosing instead to preserve the young boy, fascinated by radio - which goes contrary to what boys and children in general experience in any war, which instantly strips them of their childhoods forever. The subplot featuring Von Rumpel, the old Nazi who searches for the mystical diamond seems to be attached to the rest of the book for no reason except to move the plot forward - there's no complexity to his character at all, and develops exactly as expected.This is a book which looks as if it was designed to be read by younger readers - it's colorful setting, short chapters, switching points of narration will satisfy those with short attention spans, who require their story to be told quickly, engagingly, and not too demanding. I think all swearwords used in the book can be counted on the fingers of one hand; its language is very mellow and mild on obscenities. For a novel set during World War 2, it is a surprisingly tame book - murder and death cannot be escaped, but is downplayed as much as possible. One horrible instance of violence - which could have very well changed a character's perception on things - occurs essentially off screen, lowering possible impact it could have had on said character. This is World War 2, PG-13.All The Light We Cannot See is a carefully crafted and constructed book, which for me remains its greatest flaw - I could never stop seeing the author's own hand behind the scenes, which made characters act out events in certain way, obviously planned well ahead. It's a fantasy world populated with unreal people, who engage in a fantasy war - and is bound to appeal to hundreds of readers, because this is what they want and appreciate. Popular for one season or two, but unlikely to be remembered in a decade or more."
The Nightingale,Kristin Hannah,4.64,"I really tried, you guys. There was even a 20% period when my standards were reduced so low from the previous 70%, that I thought maybe, maybe 2*. But the last 10% was offensive. Yes, I said offensive. Review later. And by review, I mean bitch rant fest.---------People keep asking me how I didn’t like this book. Honestly, I want to ask them how they did.Never have I ever read a book by such a clueless, air-headed author.And I actually don’t even mean that to be mean, or to pick on KH. It’s just that quite frankly, those are the truest words to describe what was obviously in Hannah’s mind when she wrote this book: nothing.She forgets what she writes a chapter, a page, a paragraph, hell, in a few instances, even one sentence, earlier. Examples? Mais oui, but of course! 1. She forgets to age characters (this in the first chapter. Isabelle is 4 and Vianne is 14 when their mother dies. Vianne is taken crying to Le Jardin and falls in love. At 16, she’s pregnant, at 17 she has a miscarriage. Then, of her miscarriage, Hannah writes: “She’d crawled into her grief and cocooned it around her, unable to care about anyone or anything—certainly not a needy, wailing four-year-old-sister.”)2. She forgets the weather. Isabelle treks out of the house pre-dawn in “knee-deep snow” and then steals a bicycle that same morning from an SS officer who is across the street in a cafe. Okay, so I’m from Ottawa, which in 2015 was the coldest capital ON EARTH. I’ll PRETEND you can actually ride a bicycle in “knee-deep” snow (you can’t). But Isabelle takes the bike straight to Henri’s apartment to hide it—I’m sorry but TRACKS?!?!?! The SS officer will walk out of the cafe, see the missing bike…and see tire marks that lead straight to the French Resistance headquarters. Or do you want to tell me people were plowing the streets in this village of a 1000 people?!3. She forgets the season. Winter temperatures Isabelle climbs over a rose-covered wall. WHICH, to be fair to Hannah, I live in Tuscany, where roses do grow on some mild winter days. But roses certainly are not growing in Carriveau in the wintertime because...4. She forgets CLIMATE. Again, I’m from Ottawa. Hannah’s descriptions of this French winter in her imaginary town in the Loire Valley seem to be inspired by the Arctic Tundra, because she’s got (wait for it, ARE YOU READY?) knee-deep snow, hail, ice rain, sleet, frosted windows, “ice-sheened glass” and “frost-limned windows”, “she didn’t want to go out into the cold white world again … she stepped over the threshold … and out into the snowstorm”, “Bending forward, angling into the wind, she trudged through the wet, heavy snow … hit the ground, cracked her head on the snow-covered step”.5. She forgets where her characters are placed (in one instance, Vianne exits her bedroom in the middle of the night to write down the Jewish children’s names on the kitchen table, then finishes her job, leans back, thinks about her own kids for a bit…then reaches out and strokes her sleeping children’s heads, then cuddles in bed with them).6. She forgets when characters have no money. Vianne stuffs newspaper print in her coat for extra warmth and gets a tin can of oil in the queue…but has money to just hop on a train to see Isabelle in prison. Forget the permits she would need since by then ALL OF FRANCE was occupied.She also doesn’t seem to understand the definition of several key words in her novel: refugee, garden, village, poor. 
REFUGEE:
 is 
NOT
 local inhabitants of a city under attack fleeing to distant relatives in the countryside or neighboring towns, or lodging in hotels in the countryside or neighboring towns. I also took a lot of issue with how Hannah describes these fleeing locals. 1. Chaos. Dust. Crowds. The street was a living, breathing dragon of humanity, inching forward, wheezing dirt, honking horns; people yelling for help, babies crying, and the smell of sweat heavy in the air.2. like flotsam in the reeds of a muddy river3. Like a thousand-legged centipede, the crowd moved forward into the great hall. [Side rant: as for this “thousand-legged centipede” does she perhaps mean a MILLIPEDE?!]4. The refugees who had arrived before her would have moved through the town like locusts, buying every foodstuff on the shelves.5. clothes so tattered and patched she was reminded of the war refugees who’d so recently shuffled through Paris, hoarding cigarettes and bits of paper and empty bottles, begging for change or help. [Isabelle, when meeting Gaetan—notice how she’s not part of these “war refugees” even though SHE WAS.]6. There were dozens of people in her yard; mostly women and children, moving like a pack of hungry wolves. Their voices melded into a single desperate growl.7. The crowd surged around him like water around a rockNotice how they’re all…not human? Lumped into a collective beast (a dragon, rushing water, millipede, pack of growling, hungry wolves) that is THE REFUGEES? But what’s more sickening about all of this is that Isabelle was part of them, and yet never once does Hannah include her in these ominous descriptions of (dun dun dun dunnnnn) THE REFUGEES. Instead, she was getting kissed by the handsome Gaetan, because she’s above the smelliness of refugee status, apparently. Also, we’re reminded three times throughout the book that “the refugees” broke Vianne’s gate. This kind of language that dehumanizes refugees needs to stop.
GARDEN:
 Le Jardin is supposedly a garden, and literally means “The Garden” in French. But this “garden” is a fucking farm because in a 1940 French village it has chickens, rabbits (both plural), a stone wall covering all of it, a BARN with a car inside it, and ANOTHER cellar, a hill with a “hillside between the garden and the barn” and is so big that Isabelle can come in the middle of the night with three communists and move the car in the barn and hide a dead body and Vianne, inside at home, HEARS NOTHING. More implausible still, even after the wall was torn down, not ONE of the poor, starving French people broke in to steal her fruits, vegetables, and live stock. 
VILLAGE:
 This village of 1000 people has Nazis, SS, and Gestapo, and a networked train system. 
POOR (Part I):
 Seriously guys, what class were these people? Farmers? Because they own a farm. Village people? Nope, because they have expensive silverware, Limoges plates, Alençon lace, original impressionist paintings, and a spare bedroom. Let’s break down the math. Isabelle is 19 in 1939. She is 10 years younger than Vianne. So Vianne was born in approx. 1910. Which means…despite a dead mother, a drunk absent father throughout her entire life, growing up in WWI, living through the GREAT DEPRESSION that followed, getting pregnant at 16 (and going to university while pregnant, according to Hannah) miraculously her and her parents had money (they live in a house a mile away from a village of 1000 people, keep in mind), for a car and to put both girls in university. A car, a property with an acre of land, university for both daughters—I mean, I’m jealous here in 2016. Isabelle is bilingual, and knows how to drive a car, and is 19 years old and still in boarding schools in 1940 France, LEARNING TO CUT AN ORANGE. I just can’t stress the time period enough. Getting kicked out, no less, for failing to learn how to cut an orange. At 19. So then who taught her English, if her school was so worthless? I doubt it was her dead mother or absent father. To say nothing of the fact that back then at 19 you should be married. 
POOR (Part II):
 During the war, they were eating cats and rats. People were stealing bread. There was nothing. Salt was precious as gold and used for preserving food, NEVER for seasoning it. Some examples of starvation during wartime poverty in this book:1. but what about the coming winter? How could Sophie stay healthy without meat or milk or cheese? [Because bread, vegetables, and fruits were in abundance in wartime winters] 2. She had sold off her family’s treasures one by one: a painting to feed the rabbits and chickens through the winter [EAT. THE FUCKING. RABBITS. This is Europe in the 1940s for fuck’s sake. Eat the goddamn rabbits.]3. Moments later, she carried out a heavy ceramic tray bearing the fried fish surrounded by the pan-roasted vegetables and preserved lemons, all of it enhanced with fresh parsley. The tangy, lemony sauce in the bottom of the pan, swimming with crusty brown bits, could have benefited from butter, but still it smelled heavenly. [Wartime poverty equals no butter, got it.]3. “There is no food here in the city, Isabelle ... People are raising Guinea pigs for food. You will be more comfortable in the country, where there are gardens.” [As long as you have a garden, you’re fine.]4. Vianne began finely chopping the mutton. She added a precious egg to the mix, and stale bread, then seasoned it with salt and pepper.This book read more like a Mediterranean slim fast diet and a vintage fashion catalog than anything else. Other than Hannah constantly saying how much they were losing weight and starving and going without, I would never have known. Take away her adjectives like stale and precious, and it’s fucking gourmet.If this book wasn’t so heavily inspired by Andrée De Jongh, I might not be so harsh on it. But it is. So, yes, a woman who WAS a war hero, after working for the Red Cross, who set up the Comet Line with her father, went to a concentration camp, survived—for Hannah to sentimentalise her life the way she did, it IS offensive. By focusing so heavily on Isabelle’s beauty, and having Isabelle’s beauty be the reason she so easily slides past the Nazis (even Isabelle admits this!), Hannah is actually ROBBING De Jongh of her strength, courage, power, heroism. And I have a bone to pick with Hannah: the real Andrée De Jongh was not blond. I find it wrong for a blond American author to take a real woman, change her short curly black hair and add long blond hair instead (hair so pretty when Beck comments on it, SHE CUTS IT OFF), and then start saying she’s “impossibly beautiful.” Especially in a book about WWII, where Hitler was prejudiced to anyone who was not of blond hair, blue eyed Aryan race. What the hell?!?!This book is no more historical fiction than Disney is a true retelling of the Brothers Grimm stories. Which gets even WORSE when you start looking at what Hannah opted to change from the real De Jongh. No mention of a spouse, in later life or during the war effort, is mentioned for De Jongh. She survived the concentration camp and lived until she was 90. She began establishing the Comet Line after she first worked in the Red Cross (ie, she didn’t scribble a V on a poster and hand out fliers and BAM, hiked Pyrenees). In contrast, Hannah gives Isabelle daddy issues, has her begin working for the rebels to impress a love interest, then has her die contentedly in her lover’s arms. What’s so astounding and disturbing is that all the things that Hannah changed about De Jongh, were the things that made De Jongh strong, powerful, resilient, caring, heroic.Then there is the writing style.The number of times that Hannah repeated the same mediocre turn of phrase had me feeling like she was just enamored with her own writing. Which was sad, because the oft-repeated turns of phrase were mediocre at best, rendered embarrassing after, oh, the fifth time. How many times does a car horn “aah-oo-gah”? How many times do characters note the black markings on the wall where pictures used to hang? Hint: one time too many. How many times is something “was all she could say”? (Seven times too many. Note to Hannah: if that’s all a character says, it goes without saying that that’s all she could say.) How many times do people “tent” their hands over their eyes? The French words peppering this novel were the most generic one word expressions (oui, merde) that felt like Hannah couldn't be bothered to consult a French editor so she stuck with the most basic words. Merde is not the go-to French cuss either. Nor is it especially not the ONLY French cuss word either.Similes that mix senses abound — “roses tumbling like laughter” is just ONE example. Clouds are stretched tight as clotheslines — it goes on. The result was, for me, a very cartoonish book with clothesline-hanger clouds (complete with clothes flapping), laughing roses, and a Roger Rabbit cameo every time a horn “aah-oo-gahs”. And, in fact, Hannah thought her little aah-oo-gah was so clever that she even turned it, in one instance, into a verb. Aah-oo-gahed. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried, you guys. Think that’s not so bad? In the middle of a detailed rape scene, we have, ladies and gents, He kicked the door shut with his booted foot and then shoved her up against the wall. She made an ooph as she hit. This is exactly the kind of sentimental, senseless, ridiculous, bullshit chick-lit writing that is PRECISELY why men make fun of chick-lit, and what basically sets feminism back about a leap year or three.Then there was what I can only describe as empty calorie description. The only flowers Hannah seems to know of are jasmines and roses. Every time there is a group of people, a baby wails and women cry/scream. Every. Bloody. Time.Vianne sat down beside Sophie. She thought about their old life—laughter, kisses, family suppers, Christmas mornings, lost baby teeth, first words. This is a generic description of motherhood that I, a non-mother, could have come up with. I could go on about the idyllic descriptions of France in WWII. All I’ll say is seriously, just pick up a vintage hat catalogue and French magazine and you’ve got the best of KH’s The Nightingale. We’re talking picnics with checkered blankets, brimmed hats, aprons, pencil skirts, berets. The book was a fashion show, really. The anachronisms were so bad too that it felt like watching a shoddily done play where the only thing historical is the fashion. (Expressions like “I’m pretty sure” and “bombed the hell out of” make appearances.)Am I being too harsh? I could just be a little pissed of still from the fucking bullshit that was the last two chapters of this trash book.SO this book is about two polar opposite sisters in Nazi-occupied France. Sounds brilliant! Except it has fuck all to do with sisters. It’s all romance. All the book does is romanticise war. You might be thinking, but come on, what’s wrong with adding romance in a war story?Honestly? NOTHING.So why am I complaining that this is “romanticized”? Because Hannah uses war and tragedy in SERVICE of a romance. It’s a backdrop, a pretty set, for a romance to play out, just like the 5,000,000,055 references to clothes, hats, and valises. Hannah even uses a real women , a real war hero, to service her love story.Is this book really about two sisters learning to love each other? I wish.Isabelle puts not just her sister but also her NIECE in jeopardy by bringing the downed airman into the barn. She escapes, Vianne stays behind. What happens when Isabelle receives a letter saying that Vianne has a new Nazi billeting with her? This: Vianne was fine—she had been released after questioning—but another soldier, or soldiers, was billeted there. She crumpled the paper and tossed it in the fire. She didn’t know whether to be relieved or more worried. Instinctively, her gaze sought out Gaetan, who was watching her as he spoke to an airman. And then a page of her unrequited love for Gaetan. That, you guys, is all the passing thought she gives to her sister. Have you guys heard this famous quote by Winnie the Pooh? “Always remember: you’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” Well, have you also heard the modernized tumblr version? It’s the same, but with “and twice as beautiful as you ever imagined.” That last addition is usually written in bigger text or italicized for emphasis. I’m going to quote someone else now who analyzed it first:
Why did girls feel like something was missing from that quote in its original form? … Because the message that we constantly receive is that girls are not valuable without beauty.
Brave, strong, and smart are NOT enough for women—they must be beautiful, too.Why is this related to The Nightingale? Because of THIS:1. “[Gaetan] won’t think I’m pretty anymore.”2. Vianne kissed [Isabelle’s] cheek. “You’re beautiful,” she said.3. When he drew back, he stared down at her and the love in her eyes burned away everything bad; it was just them again, Gaetan and Isabelle, somehow falling in love in a world at war. “You’re as beautiful as I remember,” he said.4. It didn’t matter that she was broken and ugly and sick. He loved her and she loved him.Then in the last chapter, Vianne:1. “I thought she was reckless and irresponsible and almost too beautiful to look at.”2. “Isabelle Rossignol died both a hero and a woman in love.”According to Hannah, it isn’t that Isabelle survived the concentration camps and is a war hero that matters. What matters is that she came back STILL BEAUTIFUL.Yes, I do realise that she was bald and had malnutrition, weighed eighty pounds, had typhus and pneumonia and was coughing blood. I do realise that Hannah was saying that, despite all that, she was beautiful. Which at face value seems like a terrific message to send out.But more important than her dying a war hero, was that she died a woman in love. Because that’s Vianne’s final thought, the final thing about her sister at the speech at the end. That she died a woman in love. Not, as Hannah tried to pretend, after seeing a free France and being part of the resistance. In the camp, Isabelle “had to stay alive long enough to see an Allied victory and a free France.” But she does see a free France... and still her life is not “enough.” In fact, she wanders out in the rain because “Gaetan promised to find me after the war was over ... I need to get to Paris so he can find me.” Her life becomes “enough” when Gaetan appears.Why isn’t it enough that Isabelle is a war hero? That she was brave? Smart? Strong? Here’s a radical feminist thought: why can’t we, as women, just leave beauty out of the equation entirely? Even if she was a pretty woman, why does it need to be mentioned? And at every page, too? Which brings me back to that Winnie the Pooh quote. For women, to be brave, strong, and smart, it is not enough.Because Isabelle was exactly all three of those things.And let me ask Hannah the same question she asked in the book.“You should take a break, maybe. Let someone else do your mountain trips.”[Isabelle] gave [her father] a pointed look. Did people say things like this to men? Women were integral to the Resistance. Why couldn’t men see that?Yeah, Hannah? Well, do people say “He died both a hero and a man in love”? I think not.Let it be enough that she was a war hero, please.","“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Isabelle. Paris is overrun. The Nazis control the city. What is an eighteen-year-old girl to do about all of that?”
What, indeed.I really didn't know what to expect going into The Nightingale. Given the quote about love and war in the blurb, I kind of thought it might be an historical romance set during the Second World War - like the world really needs another The Bronze Horseman - but it turned out to be so much more than that.There are love stories in The Nightingale, but that's not really what the book is about. It's about women in wartime, and it's an interesting, moving portrait of the Nazi occupation of France and what this meant for all the wives, daughters and widows left behind. We're told in the book that men always assume war is about them - it's true - so this is the untold story of the home front. These are the women who are forced to house Nazi soldiers, the women who are manipulated into betraying their friends, the women who wish they could fight for their country and the women who secretly do. The main story is about two very different sisters - Vianne and Isabelle - who are trying to survive during wartime. Vianne is older and misses her husband (who is in a Nazi war camp); she must deal with her rebellious younger sister and the Nazi soldier living in her home, whilst also making sure her daughter doesn't starve. Isabelle is one of those borderline insufferable characters that also inspires affection. She reminds me of fiery, annoying, but ultimately lovable heroines like Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind and Kitty from The Painted Veil. The best thing about her, though, is her growth. She starts out a naive 18 year old who falls in love with handsome young men instantly, and she later grows into someone wiser. I loved the way her characterization was handled.On that note about falling in love, this book throws up a number of red herrings. When Isabelle instantly falls for Gaetan, I was rolling my eyes and thinking ""oh great. It's that kind of book."" But don't worry, that isn't the story being told here. It's a multilayered book and none of the relationships are straight forward.And it's also incredibly sad and moving in parts, as a book about war generally is. Children in wartime are forced to grow up so fast in order to survive. Take, for example, this exchange between Vianne and her daughter:
“Vianne cupped Sophie’s thin face in her hands. “Sarah died last night,” she said gently.“Died? She wasn’t sick.”Vianne steeled herself. “It happens that way sometimes. God takes you unexpectedly. She’s gone to Heaven. To be with her grandmère, and yours.”Sophie pulled away, got to her feet, backed away. “Do you think I’m stupid?”“Wh-what do you mean?”“She’s Jewish.”Vianne hated what she saw in her daughter’s eyes right now. There was nothing young in her gaze—no innocence, no naïveté, no hope.”
You really get a sense of how the Nazis took over the lives of the French people. How it was subtle and manipulative, built on fear. They gradually caused divisions within communities, scaring people into betraying their friends. It wasn't a perfect book, if there is such a creature. There were some slow parts that could have been shortened or edited out all together. And I wish the author hadn't used a bunch of American terms and measurements. For example, a ""cup"" measurement is not used in France. But whatever, I enjoyed it a lot.
In the silence between them, she heard a frog croak and the leaves fluttering in a jasmine-scented breeze above their heads. A nightingale sang a sad and lonely song.
Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store","It was the comparisons to All the Light We Cannot See that attracted me to The Nightingale. Though both novels are set during WW2 the similarities for me stopped there. All the Light is a magical novel electric with beautiful resounding prose and refined artistry; The Nightingale is a novel motored essentially by cliché and exaggeration. Clichéd writing isn’t just resorting continually to stock phrases (though Hannah does this a lot); it’s also straining for tension through exaggeration to the point where dramatic tension degenerates into melodrama. No surprise that clichéd phrases often perform a task of exaggeration. - “She was scared to death.” “She couldn’t believe her eyes.” The Nightingale reads like YA fantasy fiction. Everything is wildly exaggerated so that WW2 is perceived as a kind of post nuclear holocaust world where this one event utterly eclipses the world we live in. The perspective of the novel is one of hindsight as if all the characters are experiencing not the daily hardships of the war but the totality of all WW2’s horrors. It’s like her research consisted of jotting down every single horror story and deprivation and shoe-horning them all into her story. It’s mostly set in a small town in the middle of France yet this small town is “swarming” with German soldiers, Gestapo, SS, Jews, bomb damage as if the entire war is centred there (I was only surprised Hitler and Eva Braun didn’t have a holiday home there as well). The two main characters are loaded with the ordeals & accomplishments of an entire circuit of resistance members. Isabelle is every SOE heroine rolled into one and Vianne is a kind of female Schindler. Plausibility is often sacrificed to “thrills and spills”. In the space of three pages a Jewish woman is told the Nazis will arrive at her house the next morning. Three paragraphs later – or two hours later - she has magically acquired false identity papers. Three paragraphs later she is about to cross through a peaceful checkpoint when inexplicably the German guard begins machine gunning everyone as if he got bored just checking papers. He even takes the trouble to shoot the woman’s nine year old child in the back. This is all passed off without explanation as if it were a normal wartime incident. The big surprise though is that the ending is genuinely moving and really well managed. Hence all the gushing reviews. Basically to enjoy this you need to anaesthetize your critical faculties. That done I guess there’s enjoyment to be had because Hannah is a decent storyteller and is good at developing human relationships. No doubt it’ll soon be a Hollywood film."
The Help,Kathryn Stockett,4.46,"I have this terrible, dreary feeling in my diaphragm area this morning, and I’m not positive what it’s about, but I blame some of it on this book, which I am not going to finish. I have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff, but the thing is that I do like stupid stuff sometimes, and I think it would be really boring to only like smart things. What I don’t like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don’t know. I can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally, all writers I'm pretty sure my angry friend loves. For example, The Lovely Bones, The Kite Runner, Water for Elephants, Memoirs of a Geisha, etc.). These are the books for which I have no patience, topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately, without exploiting the victimization of the characters. They’re books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can’t criticize. The Help is one of these.You’ve got this narrative telephone game in this book. The telephone game is pretty fun sometimes, and it is really beautiful in monster stories like Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest. All of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative. I don’t feel that way about the topic of The Help, though. In this book, a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the Civil Rights movement, who overhears the conversations of white women. It's an important topic, and I don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators.So, I can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids, but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they’re all speaking perfect English without a trace of an accent. It becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women, Celia Foote, whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable. Who is this narrator? Why does she choose not to speak proper English if she can speak it? Why does she choose to give proper English to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it? Also, usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book. In this case, it’s the author’s voice stabbing through the story. I am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking TV English, and the black women speaking in dialect. It gives away the game. Even the quotes from the movie have an example of this. A conversation between her and Minnie goes like this:Celia Foote: They don't like me because of what they think I did.Minny Jackson: They don't like you 'cause they think you white trash. Celia speaks in a proper sentence, but Minny misses the ""are"" in the second part of the sentence. Celia says ""because,"" but Minny says ""'cause."" If the reader were supposed to understand that Celia does not speak in dialect, that would make sense, but since it specifically states that she does, it doesn't make sense.To attempt to be clear, I didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect. I had a problem that the book said, ""This white woman speaks in an extreme dialect,"" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect. Aerin points out in message 111 that I am talking about eye dialect, which is about spelling, not pronunciation, as in the example above. Everyone, in real life, speaks in some form of non-standard English. Though I have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect, as Aerin points out, writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated, which often has racist overtones. If it troubles you that I'm saying this, and you would like to comment on this thread, you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say.I’m not finishing this one, and it’s not because I think people shouldn’t like it, but rather because I’m almost 100 pages in and I can see the end, and it’s failed to engage me. When a few IRL friends have asked what I thought of the book and I said I didn't care for it, they have told me that I am taking it too seriously, that it is just a silly, fluff book, not a serious study of Civil Rights. Again, I don’t have a problem with stupid books, but when it’s a stupid book disguised as an Important Work of Cultural History, all I want to do the whole time is tear its mask off. And a book about Civil Rights is always important cultural history to me. Anyway, the book becomes unpleasant; I become unpleasant; it’s bad news. If you loved this book, though, (or, really, even if you hated it) I would recommend Coming of Age in Mississippi. I think that book is one of the more important records of American history. Plus, it’s beautifully written, inspirational, and shocking. It's been years since I read it, so I might be giving it an undeserved halo, but I can’t say enough good things about it.INDEX OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS REVIEW""You should finish the book before you talk about it"": comment 150 (second paragraph); comments 198 and 199. “Stockett did experience the Civil Rights Era”: comment 154; comment 343.“The author of The Lovely Bones was raped”: comment 190.“The author of The Kite Runner is from Afghanistan”: comment 560.""Memoirs of a Geisha is accurate and not comparable to The Help"": comment 574.“Don’t be so critical!”: comment 475.“Have you written a bestseller?”: comment 515.“Fiction doesn’t have to be a history lesson”: comments 157 through 162.“Having grown up in the South during this era and having had a maid, I could relate to the emotional nuances of this book”: comments 222 and 223.""Minny and Aibileen are relatable"": comment 626“You are trying to silence authors”: comment 317 and comments 306 through 316.“Why do you want to read a Civil Rights book about racism and hatred? I would prefer one about friendship and working together”: comment 464.“Why are there so many votes for such a half-assed review?”: comment 534.“Authors can write outside of their personal experiences”: comments 569 through 587.","I was uncomfortable with the tone of the book; I felt that the author played to very stereotypical themes, and gave the characters (especially the African American ones) very inappropriate and obvious voices and structure in terms constructing their mental character. I understand that the author wrote much of this as a result of her experiences growing up in the south in the 1960's, and that it may seem authentic to her, and that she was even trying to be respectful of the people and the time; but, ultimately, I thought that it was written from a very narrow, idealized, almost childish perspective of race relations without a true appreciation of the humanity and soul of the characters. And the ultimate theme & message (i.e. ""why, we're all the same - there's no difference between us after all!"") only reinforced my feeling that this is written from someone who has a very undeveloped or underdeveloped concept of race and race relations in the United States. The author would benefit from exploring authentic African American voices (Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou) and understanding the scope, range and (most important) the foundation of the emotions genuine African American characters express as a result of their journey as a people in the US (hope, frustration, drive, passion, anger, happiness, sadness, depression, joy).","I read the first paragraph of The Help, absorbing the words, but suddenly being caught off guard by the dialect. I stopped reading.I shifted the book in my hands, flipping to the author's biography and photograph on the back of the dust jacket. Staring up at me was this: [image error]Oh, sweet Jesus, I thought. An affluent, white Manhattanite. Great. And one who apparently fancies herself a master at Southern Black Vernacular. Even better.I rolled my eyes and returned to page one, fully prepared to hate every word on every page, beginning with Aibileen's horrifically stereotyped ""voice"" written by this smug White Lady. Look, I really don't subscribe to the belief that one must be a part of a culture in order to write effectively (or even stirringly) about or in the voice of that culture. Wally Lamb wrote convincingly as a twin in I Know This Much Is True (and as an identical twin, I can vouch for its authenticity). Nancy Farmer wove African culture beautifully into her science fiction novel The Ear, The Eye, and the Arm. Mark Haddon's Christopher Swinton character is a remarkable sketch of a child with autism. So clearly it can be done. But I was not convinced about Stockett.When Minnie's first chapter hopped along in The Help, I prepared myself for an unconvincing spin on Aibileen's narrative, a pasty twist of the vernacular that had been spewed out in the first paragraph. That is not what I got. Instead, her character was nothing like the other maid; her own voice was rendered in tough, bitter layers, providing a nice foil to Aibileen's complex struggle between resolve and resign. NO! my brain screamed. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! DO NOT ENJOY THIS!But the pages turned, and when I next looked up at the clock, a few hours had passed and I was well on my way to the halfway point. Dammit.And this was the pattern that followed in the 2 1/2 days it took me to read The Help; I found myself loving it and hating it simultaneously, but leaning more to the Love side of the dilemma. There are countless trite episodes in The Help, standard plot fillers that can be found in both heaving Harlequin romances and sucky Oprah Book Club fodder. But there are more moments of striking beauty, humanity, and humor, even if the ending is a bit of a cop-out. (No surprise that The Rich White Lady Saves The Day And Gets What She Wants.)Is The Help Great Literature? No. Is it a fast and enjoyable read? Yes. It's also a fairly striking and genuine portrait of what life in the south was like during those tumultuous times. And for that... well, for that I quite liked it.So congratulations, Whitey McWhiterson, I wound up not hating your book. And God knows I tried."
Outlander,Diana Gabaldon,4.26,"Quick question: if this book has a quarter of a million ratings and still maintains an average rating of 4.13, why the hell are the most popular reviews the snarky, mean spirited, one or two star reviews?

SUMMARY:
Claire is happily married. She and her husband are visiting Scotland and soaking up the history while indulging in some much needed time alone. One morning, they are witness to a group of women performing a ritual at a nearby stone circle.""They should have been ridiculous, and perhaps they were. A collection of women in bedsheets, many of them stout and far from agile, parading in circles on top of a hill. but the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call.(The modern witches at the stone circle...spooky and oh, such a good mood setter!!!)Claire returns to the circle later. I wonder if she felt called to that magical place, as if fate had plans for her and she was simply following her destiny.The tallest stone of the circle was cleft, with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces...""Without warning, and for no apparent reason, Claire is whisked back to the year 1743.I could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot, then disappeared altogether, leaving not darkness, but a bright void. I could say that I felt as though I were spinning or as though I were being pulled inside out. All these things are true, yet none of them conveys the sense I had of complete disruption, of being slammed very had against something that wasn't there.""There she meets James Fraser, a man who is as complex as their relationship turns out to be. Claire never stops trying to get back home, but this world of the past and her present is slowly beginning to sink into her. She must now decide between remaining faithful to a man she may never see again, or conceding to the realization that she will forever remain in this time, with this fascinating man who has become her fiercest protector. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~It's pure craziness to me how this book can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs. And it's both detrimental and beneficial that a summary simply cannot encompass the sheer scope of heart that is in these pages. I was absolutely unprepared.Why detrimental? Because the details did become tedious, even as they were adding to the story. The downtime...instead of a time of building anticipation, became a time of hurry up and wait. This is the only reason that I can't give this five stars...because, for a couple hundred pages, I was 'a wee bit' bored. And I hope that my saying this won't keep someone from reading it. I wish that I didn't have to mention it, but in order to be fair and honest, I feel like it's necessary, if only to keep someone's expectations from becoming too high. And to be totally confusing, it's the details that drag you down into the middle of the eighteenth century, the minor secondary plots that make you live this life for awhile. So I'm not certain that they weren't necessary. I do wish that we got more of Claire dealing with the mundane things, but she just never seems bothered enough with inconveniences to mention them.I don't want to do much of a character breakdown except for maybe the three big key players in this story. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Claire...

""You're no verra sensible, Sassenach, but I like ye fine.""
Oh boy. I had heard that a lot of people didn't like Claire at first. And to be quite honest, for most of the book I really DID like her. She was fairly steadfast to her husband...although circumstances bieng what they were, it would have been nearly impossible for her to stay that way. This was a fascinating look into what it must have been like for a woman back in those times. Not quite the Dark Ages but boy, they were a far cry from modern women's rights. This was a time of witch burnings and mob mentality. Imagine what it would be like to go back to these times, knowing what we know now, remembering what took place in history, and being scared to death to be female. You're completely at the mercy of the men you are with. Thank goodness Claire stumbled upon Jamie.Her character did fluctuate for me, for obvious reasons. I had a few minor hiccups with how wishy washy she was at times, and how little she seemed to think about how her actions would affect Jamie. However,  I do think that she had no idea how passionately Jamie felt for her until near the very end. So why would she feel the need to constantly spare his feelings and put him first?  At some point, she has to think of herself. The time frame in which all of this happens is not exactly conducive to accepting her fate and giving up on her whole life before Scotland. So I felt like I could cut her a break. She has an awful lot to deal with and I feel like she did the best she could. And toward the end...she becomes just as much a hero as Jamie does. You just have to wait for her to build up to this amazing person that she was meant to be. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Jamie...
Yes, I swooned, I gushed, I loooooooved Jamie Fraser! Who wouldn't? Who would admit to it if they didn't? However, he is really not at all what I expected. I like the badass boys, the heroes, the heartbreakers, those men who make you wonder if they will ever be tamed. I like men on the edge of good and evil, the ones that you are always unsure of. But there's just something about the nice guy, the man who...as soon as you meet him, you know his heart is pure and good. There are no questions with regards to Jamie about his purity of character. He's the epitome of good. He's a great mix of beta male (somewhat in the background, not horribly outspoken, usually backup for the leaders) and alpha male (leader, loud and proud, tends to be bossy and pushy.) I expected Jamie to be a more stand out guy but honestly, it was all in the “knowing” of Jamie that made me fall for him. He is one of the most honorable, strong minded, tender, loyal and devoted fictional men I've ever, ever read about. As Jamie himself puts it, he ”I havena the taste for power at the cost of other men's blood.” All of these romance heroes that we read about...the Dukes and Lords and Lairds and such...all of the battles and death and heartache...they're entitled to their place in society, to revel in their own sense of power and self-righteousness. Jamie just wants peace, a home, his wife, and a good life. Simple but so powerful. If only more people felt that way, if only more men were heroes because of the battles they didn't fight.Claire tending to Jamie's shoulder...
""Ye need not be scairt of me,"" he said softly. ""Nor of anyone here, so long as I'm with ye.""
That is not to say that he was perfect. One big, huge point of contention for me was  when he beats Claire after she tries to find the stone circle and instead ends up getting captured. I don't care what year it is, That's never right. To beat her until she can't sleep, can't sit down, and then allow his men to make fun of her for days afterward while she is healing...this is one of the more cruel things that I've ever forgiven a hero for. I suppose if I'm going to forgive, it may as well be James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Randall...
I truly think that he is not only one of the most vile, heartless, disgusting, noxious, EVIL villains that I've ever met, he is also, oddly, an object of pity. Not to be mistaken for sympathy. He deserves a slow, torturous, endless agonizing death. His singleminded foxhunt of Jamie is confusing at first and later, every time his name is mentioned, I literally became filled with rage. I'm one of those that cried when I'm angry and I can't even tell you how hard I cried. Enough that I couldn't read any more. I had to calm down first. Poor Jamie :(  Here is my reaction, of which I typed in the buddy read I was taking part in after I read the specific part that made me hate...literally hate Randall. Do not read this if you don't want a huge spoiler. You've been warned!!82%  Son of a fucking bitch!!! Not only did Jamie get raped but we don't even get to see that evil, sadistic ass hole suffer? I'm so mad right now. So fucking mad. And what the hell was all the wolf bullshit? Why even put that in there? It has no bearing on the story except to draw out the part where Jamie is once again flogged...tortured, burned, beat, raped. So I say again...what the fuck? I'm a vindictive bitch. I want payback. That fucker needs to suffer. Jamie needs to look him in the eye while he guts him. How fucking anticlimactic to give him an easy out. I am just livid. I'm so pissed off I'm crying Yeah, suffice it to say that I really hope we get more of Randall and that Ms. Gabaldon feels the black rage that I felt toward him. I hope, I hope, I hope. Even rereading my reaction makes my blood pressure rise.
Final thoughts:
Yes, this is a great historical fiction novel but Jamie and Claire..their love, their devotion to each other is what makes this story epic. You just can't get around that fact. This is a love story. And so much more. I was so conflicted from the position that both Claire and Jaime were put in. What is right and wrong here? Claire loves her husband. But here she is, in this impossible situation, of which she can confide in no one. Not a single person. And so she goes first with her gut. Then with her head, and finally, FINALLY with her heart.""Does it ever stop, Claire? The wanting?"" ""You're mine, mo duinne,"" he said softly, pressing himself into my depths. ""Mine alone, now and forever. Mine, whether ye will it or no."" I pulled against his grip, and sucked in my breath with a faint ""ah"" as he pressed even deeper.""Aye, I mean to use ye hard, my Sassenach,"" he whispered. ""I want to own you, to possess you, body and soul."" I struggled slightly and he pressed me down, hammering me, a solid, inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke. ""I mean to make ye call me 'Master,"" Sassenach."" His soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes. ""I mean to make you mine.""and later...""Oh, aye, Sassenach...I am your master...and you're mine. Seems I canna possess your soul without losing my own.""With the gorgeous backdrop of Scotland, the descriptions alone, and the way the dialogue forces you to sink into the setting is worth the entire read. I'm beyond happy that I finally started this series. I'm trying to pace myself while reading the next stories, as I feel the greatness in ma bones. This book itself was so amazing, I can't imagine what's in store for me. There were a few hints...very, very tiny hints in this book of some strange happenings with regards to the time travel aspect. Things always get convoluted when it comes to the whole switching time thing. What came first, Claire in real time or Claire in 1743? What will she change by going back and messing around with her ancestors, or more so her husband's ancestors? I can't wait to find out.","I gave up on this book because I was sustaining permanent damage from reading it and I was afraid I'd start hitting back. And it's a borrowed copy, so that wouldn't be cool.In fairness, I should say there's a lot of good writing here. I really enjoyed the beginning chapters. They even kind of cracked me up, because I have friends who love genealogy and their husbands always get that look when they start talking about it and that's exactly how I imagined Claire looking when her husband Frank started droning on and on about his ancestors.And Claire is a nurse, which is a really good transportable skill if you're going to be thrown back in time which it turns out Claire is. (Sorry. Spoiler alert.) Can you imagine if you were one of those Nerds On Wheels computer repair people and you got sent to eighteenth-century Scotland? You'd be totally screwed.But Claire's skills come in handy without seeming out of place. A woman who's a dab hand at healing is always welcome in Olden Tymes, so Claire is able to land on her feet and kind of get a job once she figures out what happened to her and comes to terms with it.Which is pretty much immediately. Which is when the book started to lose me. There's, like, no culture shock whatsoever. She gets knocked back two hundred years or so. She goes, ""WHOA. What the flimminy?"" She starts being The Lady To Go To With Your Eighteenth-Century Scottish Boo-Boos. That's it. There are a few mentions of things like how shoes fit differently back then and anachronistic language, but there's no sense of the kind of thing a person from the future would be startled by. Not the food, not the weird underwear, nothing. Claire just settles in and starts being the resident nurse at a castle. She keeps half an eye out for a chance to get to the place that can take her back to the future, but it has all the deep emotional urgency that I feel when I really should stop by the grocery store on the way home but it won't kill anybody if I go tomorrow instead. Like, whatevs. Still, there was plenty to keep me interested. Like – leeches! The stuff about leeches was cool. And the info about healing herbs. And that kid getting his ear hammered to a board because he was caught stealing.Really, this book would have worked fine for me if it hadn't been for what everybody else seems to love about it, which is the Romantic Interest. Which still would have been fine, even with the whole SHE'S MARRIED ALREADY thingy. But, okay – let's say that she has to marry that guy. They aren't in love when they get married and so the whole point of the book is to watch their relationship develop, while Claire struggles with guilt and fear and thoughts of how her real husband must be worrying about her and how the heck does time-travel work in this book and WHY IS SHE JUST ASSUMING THAT TIME IS GOING BY IN THE FUTURE AT THE SAME RATE IT IS FOR HER? WHY, I ASK YOU?(Sorry. I'm a minor-league nerd, and this part really bugged me.)So what I just described would have been a book I could read and enjoy, or at least read and not scream in pain. But apparently someone gave Diana Gabaldon the creepiest piece of writing advice EVER, and it was this:""Listen – you know how if you're cooking and you're worried it's not turning out very well, just add bacon if it's savory and chocolate chips if it's sweet and everybody'll love it? Well, if you're working on your first novel and you don't know what to have happen next, just throw in some rape! Or attempted rape! Works like a charm!""She follows this advice to the letter, and I'm sorry but I have to go home now. I managed to read the ""she disobeys him so he beats her with his belt"" scene. I almost punched the book right in the face, but as I said, it's a friend's copy so I had to be nice.Then I managed to get through the ""she forgives him for the beating, like, the next freakin' day"" scene. I started fantasizing about this book getting stuck in the elevator of a burning building, but I was able to hold on and keep going.Then there was the scene where Big Kilted Oaf – I mean, Jamie – starts laughing about the whole beating thing and reminiscing about how hot she looked when he was holding her down beating the crap out of her and she forgives him for that, too. Like, instantly. And I'm all, ""WHO AM I AND WHAT AM I DOING HERE?"" And still I staggered on. Heaven only knows why. And how did the author reward me for my perseverance? What is this book all about? What's the recurring literary theme?Rape. Attempted rape. More attempted rape. Marital rape. A little more marital rape. Conversations about rape. GIGGLING during conversations about rape. And I'm all, ""I'M OUT OF HERE AND I DON'T CARE HOW MANY OF MY FRIENDS HATE ME.""I read 444 pages in a row, plus I skimmed a lot of the rest of it including the creepiest, rapiest Chekhov's gun I've ever seen fired. Do NOT tell me I didn't give this book a fair chance. I TOTALLY DID.In case you need proof, here's a list of all the things I learned about rape from Outlander.1. It's a bummer for the woman involved, but save your sympathy for her brother. (Assuming you have any emotional response at all, which you won't if you're Claire.)Jamie tells Claire about his sister Jenny being raped by a dastardly redcoat. He has a good chuckle talking about how Jenny punches and kicks her attacker. She isn't able to hold him off forever, though. And Jamie gets flogged for trying to defend her. Claire's response?""I'm sorry. It must have been terrible for you.""It is terrible for Jamie to have his sister ""dishonor herself wi' such scum."" (Nice.) So terrible that he can't bring himself to go back home to her when he gets out of prison, and ""see her again, after what happened."" She's impregnated by the rape. Left on her own both emotionally and financially, she is forced to become the mistress of another English soldier. Jamie finally sends her what money he can, but can't bring himself to write to her. Because, you know, ""what could I say?""Claire's response?""Oh, dear.""(Really -- how could I give up on this book when the main character is so sympathetic?)2. Rape can lead to comically inaccurate ideas about how people do ""the nasty!""After Jamie and Claire consummate their marriage, Jamie confesses that he ""didna realize that ye did it face to face. I thought ye must do it the back way, like; like horses, ye know."" Claire tries to keep a straight face as she asks him why on earth he thought that.""I saw a man take a woman plain, once, out in the open. But that...well, it was a rape, was what it was, and he took her from the back. It made some impression on me, and as I say, it's just the idea stuck.""So of course Claire flips out and asks him what the heck that was all about. Who was it? Why was he witness to a rape ""out in the open""? Was he able to help the woman? What happened to her?Oh. Wait. This is Claire the Emotionless. She doesn't ask him anything, and he doesn't say anything else on the subject. Instead, they cuddle and talk about how much fun what they just did was. Because a story about rape out in the open is just the kind of pillow talk a woman wants to hear when she's relaxing after a nice bout of bigamy. I mentioned I loved this book, right? I didn't? Good.3. Nearly getting raped turns you on for Mr. Right!Jamie and Claire are off on their own in the woods for a spot of marital bliss when they're set upon by highwaymen. Claire is nearly raped, but manages to kill her assailant. Yes, she was a nurse during World War II, but I think there's a difference between witnessing violence and inflicting it yourself. She kills the guy in the nick of time. He's on top of her, so she undoubtedly gets his blood all over her. Meanwhile, Jamie manages to dispatch the other two guys.And then Claire flips out about the fact that she was just attacked, and she had to kill a guy, and she had to kill a guy at close quarters with a knife.Oh. Wait. This is Claire. She has no response to any of this, now or later. Well, she does have one response:When I put my hands on his shoulders, he pulled me hard against his chest with a sound midway between a groan and a sob. We took each other then, in a savage, urgent silence, thrusting fiercely and finishing within moments.If your marital love life has been a bit blah lately, why not get attacked and then kill the guy? It'll spice things right up!4. It's not rape if it's your husband and he promises he'll hurry...""Jamie! Not here!"" I said, squirming away and pushing my skirt down again.""Are ye tired, Sassenach?"" he asked with concern. ""Dinna worry, I won't take long.""(next page):He took a firm grip on my shoulders with both hands.""Be quiet, Sassenach,"" he said with authority. ""It isna going to take verra long.""I gather it's especially not rape if your husband has an ethnic-slur nickname for you. He should use this at least three times a page. (Yes, ""Sassenach"" is derogatory. It'd be like if you were white and your husband called you his little gringo. Although that would actually be kind of funny if he's white, too. I think I want to get my husband to start calling me that now. But I digress.)5. ...or if it's your husband and he just really, really wants it.Claire is saying no, and no again. She's still in pain from the last time they did it, because he didn't take no for an answer even when she told him quite honestly he was hurting her. So how does our romantic lead respond?James Fraser was not a man to take no for an answer. ...Gentle he would be, denied he would not.I quoted that last line to my husband, and he got the same look on his face that I had on mine all through a two-day bout with food poisoning.If this book works for you, fine. I'm not here to judge. I'm just asking that you understand how completely creeped out I was by all this, and not tell me I didn't give it a fair chance. I did. I really hate not finishing a book once I start it, but I just couldn't stand it any more.","A special note to those who say my review stopped them from reading this book: No no no! Read it! I actually reread the whole series last summer and enjoyed it immensely. Just read it for what it is: ludicrous, well-written, humorous, delicious TRASH. Just don't expect it to be the most brilliant novel ever written and you'll be fine.How To Commit Adultery Without Being a Cheap Slutty Whore: A Q&A by Diana GabaldonQ: I love my husband but I'm feeling kind of restless. But adultery is wrong. So what do I do?A: Easy! Go back in time!Q: What do you mean, Ms. Gabaldon?A: If you go back in time, your husband hasn't been born yet. So you can have wild and crazy S&M sex with impunity.Q: But won't I still be married to him?A: Aren't you listening? He hasn't been BORN yet. So you aren't married! But if you are really being such a stickler, then just have someone force you to get married to someone else.Q: But, but, no one can force me to get married against my will!A: Okay, let me lay it out for you: You're really hot for this sexy warrior barbarian guy, right? I know this, because you stop thinking about your husband about 24 hours after you've been dropped in this guy's arms. So you get in this situation where some obscure tribal law insists you have to get married, make a little protest, sign some papers, and voila! Q: But that doesn't mean I have to sleep with him.A: Oh but you do, because some random dude insists that you have to. Don't worry, the sex will be great even though he's a 23 year old virgin. So you see, you HAVE to do it, so it's okay.Q; But isn't it a sin?A: Fine, find a priest at the end of the book to absolve you, whatever. And anyway, it's okay because your husband basically told you it was okay, right before you were whisked back in time. Seriously, go for it. When else will you get the chance? You've been married for years. You deserve a little hot and heavy barbarian action.Q: So what's this hot barbarian guy like?A: Well, watch out, because he loves to reminisce about how his dad used to beat him and how wonderful that was. And he really gets off on beating you, but it's just the once. Oh, and it seems that he wants you so badly he can't restrain from ramming you repeatedly with his male member while telling you how much he can't restrain himself and that gets seriously annoying after the twentieth time. But otherwise, it's all good.Q: Anything else I should be aware of?A: Surprise! Buttsex! But not for you, so it's okay.Oddly, I'm going to read the next one in the series. Because I'm bizarrely fascinated. It's like a train wreck.Edit 1:Someone in the comments said I should copy this into the review, so here you go:Plot SummaryClaire: I love my husband!

The Pillars of the Earth,Ken Follett,4.35,"I did not hate this book (hate would be too strong a word, and I can't hate it because I applaud the fact that Ken Follett attempted to write an epic novel). But I did not like it. I didn't like it from the start; his writing style hit me like a brick, but Jim thoroughly enjoyed the book that I kept trying to convince myself that I ought to give it a chance, hoping it would get better. When I was about 500 pages in, he saw how miserable I was and asked why I didn't just stop reading it, but at that point, I was invested in it; I had spent all that time getting that far, that I needed to finish it, and I couldn't wait to come to the end. I kept counting down: ""Only 450 pages left; only 300 to go; last 200 pages...yay, I have 50 pages left!"" Those fifty pages were the toughest to get through. By the time I was at the end, I thought it was a wasted effort - both on his part and mine. It's so much easier to explicate on what I did not like because there were so many things: - I loathed the writing style (he vacillated between pages and pages of highly complex architectural discourses to third-grade level simple sentences grouped into short paragraphs). Sometimes it was bearable. Other times, I wanted to pull my hair out. There were times when I felt the only time he came alive as an author was when he was discussing architecture, but these parts were so didactic in nature that it couldn't hold my interest for long periods of time.- I did not like the author's narrative style. He had to tie everything together (causality was so prevalent throughout the text that I wondered how he didn't work in how the killing of a fly affected events 60 years later). Every single storyline was wrapped up - too neatly for my liking, in some cases. Everyone was tied to someone else (it was like playing Six Degrees); every single character had to have a denouement; every little plot twist had to be explained; closure had to be achieved, no matter how preposterous the circumstances, over time and space.- The characterization was poor. In fact, it was appalling how two-dimensional these characters were. Good people were good. Bad people were loathsome. As time went on, the good were always suffering one thing or another; they were put upon; they were harrassed; they were constantly challenged and put to the test like Job (something Follett actually used as a sermon!). The badfolk became more oppressive over time; they were not only detestable, but they had absolutely no redeeming qualities. And to go with a typical medieval stereotype, the good were always excessively beautiful, honorable, intelligent (geniuses or savants, even!) - and if they weren't rich, they would be at the end (I half expected Havelok the Dane and his refrigerator mouth to pop up somewhere, proving once and for all that in the medieval period, to be good was to have the purest light shining out of your mouth each time you opened it). Nevertheless, the bad became uglier, became more despotic, scheming throughout life to get the better of their enemies (the goodfolk). But in the end, good always triumphed over evil; those who could, repented and were forgiven. Those who couldn't, were killed off somehow, because apparently, death is the only way an evil person gets his (or her) dues. And then everyone had a happy ending. I hate happy endings when they're so obviously contrived. And this work was so elaborately, exhaustively, thoroughly contrived. (Maybe it's not too late for me to change my mind and say I hated it. *grin*)- Historically speaking, there was so much left to be desired. Granted, this novel was written two decades ago, and there have been new discoveries about the medieval period since Follett started his research. But he got it all wrong anyhow. His idea of medieval life was so...off, that it hurt my head to continue reading sometimes. I had to pause periodically and rant to Jim about what I currently found off-putting (for example, there weren't many literate people at the time; at the time this novel was set, there was still a distinct divide between England and Wales; reading and writing were two separate skill sets, and people who knew how to read did not necessarily know how to write and vice versa; orality was a prevalent part of storytelling back then and books not so much and yet somehow, he conflated much of both; manuscript writing was either orally dictated or copied tediously by the monks - his concept of a scriptorium was incomplete, defective - and there has been so much written about this that it saddened me; he used modern translations of medieval poetical/verse works and couldn't explain even alliterative verse form effectively - I even wonder if he knew what it was; his understanding of the languages of the period - Old English, Middle English, Latin, Norman French, Old French, Middle French, etc. - and what was spoken by the aristocrats vs. the peasants vs. the growing middle classes disgusts me; he showed a lack of understanding of medieval law, medieval rights, the social classes, gender roles, even the tales and legends of the period, in both England and France; priests were quite low on the totem pole, in terms of the religious hierarchy, and were quite disparaged yet somehow, that didn't quite come across in this novel...I could go on and on, but I won't). And the historical part of the novel I just found lacking. There are enough histories and chronicles, contemporaneously written, of the time, that he did not have to deviate much from history. There is so much written about the period between the death of Henry I through the civil wars between the Empress Matilda and King Stephen, to the time that Henry II ascended the throne (including the martyrdom of Thomas a Beckett), that I don't quite understand how he couldn't have mined the chronicles for better material. I understand that this is why it's called historical fiction, and that there will always be some element of fiction interspersed with historical fact. But the fictional aspects usually have to do with surrounding characters and situations that bolster the history. The fiction is not necessarily to the history itself. Many times, when writing historical fiction, the author has to beware the pitfalls of creating a revisionist retelling, interspersing his or her own ideals or beliefs of what should have been to what was. If this novel had been marketed as a revisionary narrative, it would have been okay. But it wasn't. I'm just glad that the historical aspect of the novel just served as the background and not the real story. Because then, I probably would've stopped reading.The premise was a good one and held a lot of promise. It could've been a great historical epic had it been handled by a more assured writer. By someone who was more of a visionary, someone who had the patience to do exhaustive research or who knew how to craft richly developed characters. It needed an author who understood the epic genre, who knew how to mold the epic, who knew how to keep the narrative going, seemlessly binding time with narration and the human condition, without resorting to stereotypes and grating drama. And most importantly, it needed someone who understood when the story had been told; that while there will always be other stories to tell, that each book has its own natural end, and that these stories may not belong in this book.Ken Follett may be a bestselling author of suspense novels (and even historical fiction such as Pillars of the Earth and World without End), but he is no writer of epics. Compared to writers of historical fiction such as Edward Rutherford, James Michener, Bernard Cornwell or Margaret George, Ken Follett has a long way to go.","I devour books. That is my euphemism for being so obsessed that I can't put them down and live my life until I finish them. For shorter books, that's generally not a problem, but for the 974 page Pillars of the Earth...well, let's just say we ran out of food, my children clung to my legs asking for food, and the floors did not get vacuumed for a good five days while I whittled away at this book.CLIFF HANGER: This book is not a cliff-hanger-at-the-end-of-every-chapter kind of book, which makes it easier to read it in multiple sittings. However, Follett does such a masterful job of character development, that I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next whether the end of the chapter contained a cliffhanger ending or not.CHARACTER DEV'T: Each character is so beautifully defined and fleshed out, that they become almost real. I felt that I knew them personally, that I could accurately predict how they would react in different situations. None of them were 100% good or bad, just like in real life. Some priests were holy, others evil; some were rich people with big hearts, others with small minds and evil intentions; some poor farmers were judgmental, w/narrow-minded attitudes, others opened their doors to strangers.PLOT/PACE: Foreshadowing was a very powerful convention that Follett skillfully weaved in and out of every chapter. It gave subtle hints, but never so overt as to suggest that the reader may be an imbecile. Backstories meander and come to closure at such a nice pace, that it always feels like something is happening and things are being resolved, for better or for worse.THEMES: My favorite theme was that natural consequences followed the actions of the characters. (I'm still a bit out of sorts after reading the deus-ex-machina-riddled Breaking Dawn, where all the natural consequences of three books worth of actions were completely erased-ugh.) There was a natural ebb and flow of triumph and misfortunes in Pillars of the Earth. Good things happened to bad people and bad things happened to good people, just like in real life. Follett does not try to save his characters from themselves, or from each other, and I enjoyed that very much.STRONG WOMEN: I absolutely adored the strong women in this book! What a joy to read about Aliena, carving out her own future after her world had been turned upside down! Life knocked her down plenty, but each time, she got up, made a plan, and triumphed eventually. Ellen, and Agnes in her own way, were also strong women. OVERALL IMPRESSION: As strange as it sounds, with all of the despair and misery that took place, the overarching take home for me, was HOPE. In the face of overwhelming adversity, these characters triumphed. The road was hard and the journey was long, but they CHOSE hope. They CHOSE faith. And in the end, that was all that mattered.Pillars of the Earth will be on my favorite books list for a very long time.","“The most expensive part of building is the mistakes.”
Look, it's difficult to explain exactly why I liked this book. Seriously, if you take a look at the blurb, note the 973 pages, and the fact it's a very long story about building a cathedral in Medieval England, you might think I've been smoking something. But for me - and I'm assuming for a large number of other readers - it was so damn compelling.I'm going to get the crap out of the way first - if you are sensitive to scenes of rape, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Medieval England is a shitfest of misogyny, violence, accusations of witchcraft and, yes, rape. One of the scenes is especially disturbing and graphic; I actually had to take a break from the book after reading it. I should say that it is not portrayed as a positive, or even a normal, thing. Scenes of rape and brutal violence in the book largely serve to make us despise William Hamleigh with a ferocious passion. It turns out that a deep, seething hatred can really keep you turning pages, waiting for that bastard to get what he rightly deserves. Anyway, yes, the main plot is about the building of the fictional Kingsbridge cathedral. But, really, it is about all the characters that come into contact with Kingsbridge, its cathedral, and Prior Philip - their loves, desires, ambitions, conflicts and heartbreaks. I was pulled in from the very dramatic prologue when a young woman arrives at a hanging and curses the three men who guaranteed her beloved's execution.There are love stories in here, as well as tales of ruthless ambition, and betrayal. Follett has created some incredible and unforgettable characters: Tom Builder, Philip, Ellen, Jack, Aliena, and Waleran Bigod. And, of course, that snivelling stain on humanity that is William Hamleigh.I haven't read any of Follett's other work, but it is not surprising to hear he was a thriller writer before beginning The Pillars of the Earth. He has carried that with him into this story. Just when everything seems to be going right, some catastrophe happens to throw a spanner in the works. Just when it looks like Philip is going to succeed, some more shit happens. But it was an effective way to keep me looking over my shoulder.It's a strange book because it's a bloody, heart-pounding page-turner wrapped up in a 900-page, serious-looking, cathedral-building package. Strange, and yet I find myself wanting more. I guess I'll have to read World Without End.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
The Song of Achilles,Madeline Miller,4.31,"”We were like gods, at the dawning of the world, and our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other.”This book!!! 
Gosh I loved this book!!!
The moment I read the first page I was already certain of two things:1.)	This would become one of my all-time favourites and I’d gush about it like crazy.2.)	It wouldn’t only leave me devastated and heartbroken but also sobbing like a little child. Well, both of those things came true, even way earlier than I had initially anticipated. I was about 37% percent in (yes I looked it up! ;-P) when I first started to cry and it didn’t get any better after that. This book was just so beautiful! 
So, so damn beautiful!
 Madeline Miller definitely has a way with words and I loved how this story was written: Poetical with a lot of mythological facts and with so many details that it succeeded to make this a more than just intriguing journey. What I loved the most was how she managed to convey Achilles’ and Patroclus relationship though. Even though she never went into detail, never actually let them say that they loved each other; it was still palpable in every single moment they shared together. Those moments were so precious I couldn’t get enough of them and all I wanted was for them to be happy. Unfortunately I’m a little geek and know a lot about Greek mythology so yeah, I already knew how it would end before it even ended. Still, the sense of foreboding in this book!!! Oh gosh, it killed me!! All those little hints, those infinitesimal innuendos, those tiny insinuations, they piled up and up and up until all I was able to feel was dread!!! By the end of the book I was reduced to a sobbing and crying nervous wreck and the final sentence was like a dagger in my heart. In other words:This was exceptionally painful and utterly devastating, BUTit was also so damn good and worth every second of pain!The characters:
 This is my spoiler section in which I’m going to speak about the individual characters and what I thought of them. So you better beware and don’t read it if you still want to read the book. Heed my warning or get lost in the underworld. It’s your choice, choose wisely! ;-P
Achilles:’Ah.’ A sly smile spread across his face; he had always loved defiance. ‘Well, why should I kill him? He’s done nothing to me.’This sentence killed me when I first read it! Achilles, my beautiful, innocent and naïve boy!!! Jeez! I loved him so much! He was every bit the hero people believed him to be and most of the time he actually did the right thing. Well, most of the time. At the end of the book there happened a lot of things I didn’t agree with and the longer his conflict with Agamemnon lasted the more I dreaded the end! It made me so sad to see how much Achilles changed over the years and when the thing with Briseis happened my reaction was the same as Patroclus’! I mean I knew what Achilles did (I’m a geek remember?) but reading it the way Madeline Miller wrote it? Boy it destroyed me! There was this wonderful, perfect, righteous, honourable, intelligent, innocent and honest golden boy and then the war over Troy tainted him, transformed him and made him an entirely different person. The true tragedy about this all is that he never even wanted to take part in the war, he was more or less forced into it and I think looking at it in retrospective a life as a normal person would have been preferable to the one of a hero. I guess in the end Achilles saw it the same way and would have done everything in order to change his path. Even if it would have meant that he would have been forgotten and would have never become a legend… it would have been worth it. Patroclus would have been worth it…  *cries*”I stopped watching for ridicule, the scorpion’s tail hidden in his words. He said what he meant; he was puzzled if you did not. Some people might have mistaken this for simplicity. But is it not a sort of genius to cut always to the heart?””Your honour could be darkened by it.”“Then it is darkened.” His jaw shot forward, stubborn. “They are fools if they let my glory rise or fall on this.”“But Odysseus –“His eyes, green as spring leaves, met mine. “Patroclus. I have given enough to them. I will not give them this.””They grinned, loving every inch of their miraculous prince: his gleaming hair, his deadly hands, his nimble feet. They leaned towards him, like flowers to the sun, drinking in his lustre. It was as Odysseus had said: he had light enough to make heroes of them all.””It is not true. You left yourself today. And now you are returned.”His shoulders rise and fall on a long breath. “Do not say that,” he says, “until you have heard the rest of what I have done.”Patroclus:”I went to Peleus. I knelt before him on a wool rug, woven bright with purple. He started to speak, but I was too quick for him. One of my hands went to clasp his knees, the other reached upward, to seize his chin with my hand. The pose of supplication. It was a gesture I had seen many times, but had never made myself. I was under his protection now; he was bound to treat me fairly, by the law of the gods.‘Tell me where he is,’ I said.”I adored Patroclus! He was the best! He was wonderful and beautiful in his own way and I loved how faithful he was. That boy was one of the kindest and sweetest people I ever read about (tough competition for Lazlo Strange *lol*) and I was so happy Achilles saw this too. He realized that Patroclus is special and he encouraged him to speak his mind. It felt like Patroclus was Achilles’ conscience, intervening whenever his divine heritage showed. Without Patroclus Achilles path would have been dark and bloody but with him at his side he became the glorious figure we all know about. Patroclus was so much more than just a companion. He was a friend, a lover, a teacher, a conscience, a reminder and Achilles past, present and future! This boy was literally the embodiment of Achilles life and actions and the people around them were fools for not seeing their strong connection. Patroclus was everything that was good about Achilles, he brought out the best in him. Taught him compassion and love, he was an anchor and someone he could come home to! Speak to! Confide in! Once Patroclus was gone the relentless godly part of Achilles showed though and the rest of it is (bloody) history. T_T’Patroclus.’ It was the name my father had given me, hopefully but injudiciously, at my birth, and it tasted of bitterness on my tongue. ‘Honour of the father,’ it meant.”Perhaps she thought I was mocking her, flourishing my triumph. Perhaps she thought I hated her. She did not know that I almost asked him, a hundred times, to be a little kinder to her. You do not have to humiliate her so thoroughly, I thought. But it was not kindness he lacked, it was interest. His gaze passed over her as if she were not here.”’Willl you come with me?’ he asked.The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death. Yes, I whispered. Yes.”I do not know this man, I think. He is no one I have ever seen before. My rage towards him is hot as blood. I will never forgive him. I imagine tearing down our tent, smashing the lyre, stabbing myself in the stomach and bleeding to death. I want to see his face broken with grief and regret. I want to shatter the cold mask of stone that has slipped down over the boy I knew. He has given her to Agamemnon knowing what will happen.”Odysseus:”May I give you some advice? If you are truly his friend you will help him leave his soft heart behind. He’s going to Troy to kill men, not rescue them.” His dark eyes held me like swift-running current. “He is a weapon, a killer. Do not forget it. You can use a spear as a walking stick, but that will not change its nature.”Damn, how much I hated and liked that sneaky and cunning bastard!! I’m still very torn when it comes to him. On the one hand he gave sound advice and knew exactly what he did and on the other hand he forced Achilles on his destined path. If it wouldn’t have been for Odysseus he would have never gone to Troy and even though I agree with his sentiment that Achilles could save them all, I still disagree with the way he played him. Of all the countless men that manipulated young Achilles, Odysseus probably was the worst, hiding behind the mask of a friend but ultimately pursuing his own goals. Clever! Very clever indeed! Agamemnon:”Then you are a traitor to this army, and will be punished like one. Your war prizes are hostage, placed in my care until you offer your obedience and submission. Let us start with that girl. Briseis, is her name? She will do as a penance for the girl you have forced me to return.”I HATE AGAMEMNON!!! Fiercely!!! Such an unfair and dishonourable numpty!!! I hate him and all his actions! I mean what kind of father would trade his daughter away and then kill her?! His own flesh and blood! Gosh, I CAN’T EVEN WITH HIM!! I’m still so angry! Those moments at the end and the tense situation between Achilles and him had me at the edge of my seat and all I wanted to do was to scream at the injustice that took place in front of me!!! Such a stubborn and self-righteous fool!! He should have listened to Achilles but he was too proud to. *shakes head in disbelief* I. HATE. HIM!!! Enough said! Thetis:Another person that landed on my shit list! *lol* I really, really disliked her too! I mean I understand that she was Achilles mother and only wanted the best for her son, but it was more than just obvious that the best was Patroclus and I hated her for always trying to drive a wedge between them! Without Thetis half of their troubles wouldn’t have even existed and even though she kind of redeemed herself in the end I still don’t like her! Sorry Thet, but you’ll never get a thumbs-up from me! #SorryNotSorrryThe relationship:Achilles & Patroclus:”This morning he had leaped on to my bed and pressed his nose against mine. ‘Good morning,’ he’d said. I remembered the heat of him against my skin.”Ohh how sweet those two were! I loved their relationship! They were so gentle and adorable and no matter what happened and no matter how many obstacles were in their way they always managed to find back to each other! They had confidence in each other and they supported each other regardless of the consequences. Achilles and Patroclus had such an honest and beautiful relationship, I CAN’T EVEN!!!! THIS was the real deal!!! A connection so deep that no one could destroy it, a love so strong that it cast aside all obstacles, their trust so deep that they could talk about everything!!! Boy, I could gush about this relationship at eye level for eternity and still would never get tired of it! *lol* I just adore them so much! It was so sweet they couldn’t even be angry with each other and even though Patroclus wasn’t always happy with Achilles decisions, he still did his best to support him as best as he could, even if that meant that he had to go against his will. I think in the end their unconditional love for each other was the only thing that was able to break them and it eventually did. Jeez! How it did! *cries again* Achilles had no reason to kill Hector, no reason to fulfil the prophecy. Well, at least not until Hector took the only thing that mattered to him, the only thing he didn’t want to live without. Patroclus! *sobs* Hell! The way Achilles grieved!!! It broke my freaking heart!!! It was like a punch in the gut! I know first-hand how much this hurts, how painful it is to lose a person you love so much, and boy did it trigger my emotions. T_T I felt Achilles grief with him and it was so intense it left me crying and sobbing. They were so beautiful together… so, so, so damn beautiful. I can’t anymore… *weeps* ”I saw then how I had changed. I did not mind any more, that I lost when we raced and I lost when we swam out to the rocks and I lost when we tossed spears or skipped stones. For who can be ashamed to lose to such beauty? It was enough to watch him win, to see the soles of his feet flashing as they kicked up sand, or the rise and fall of his shoulders as he pulled through the salt. It was enough.””My pulse jumps, for no reason I can name. He has looked at me a thousand times, but there is something different in this gaze, an intensity I do not know. My mouth is dry, and I can hear the sound of my throat as I swallow.He watches me. It seems that he is waiting.””His eyes were unwavering, green flecked with gold. A certainty rose in me, lodged in my throat. I will never leave him. It will be this, always, for as long as he will let me.””Had she really thought I would not know him? I could recognize him by touch alone, by smell, I would know him blind, by the way his breaths came and his feet struck the earth. I would know him in death, at the end of the world.””You can’t.” He was sitting up now, leaning forward.“I can’t.”“I know. They never let you be famous and happy.” He lifted an eyebrow. “I’ll tell you a secret.”“Tell me.” I loved it when he was like this.“I’m going to be the first.” He took my palm and held it to him. “Swear it.”“Why me?”“Because you’re the reason. Swear it.”“I swear it,” I said, lost in the high colour of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.“I swear it,” he echoed.”There was more to say, but for once we did not say it. There would be other times for speaking, tonight and tomorrow and all the days after that. He let go of my hand.”All told this was one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. It caused me to cry, it made me angry, it made me smile and it touched me deeply. I’m a total mess after reading this and my emotions are still all over the place, to say I regret reading it would be one hell of a lie though.I rarely write this into my reviews but: If you haven’t read this, do it now!!! You won’t regret it! =)Last but not least I want to thank my Sweet Sugar Bun who dared to buddy read this book with me! Thank you for all the comments, messages and updates that made it bearable to read this book. I swear if you wouldn’t have discussed this with me I would have cried even more often than I already did. *lol* So yeah, thanks for that wonderful buddy read and for keeping my sanity intact. I really appreciate it! XD We definitely should go for another buddy read some time soon! I heard “Circe” is a nice book too! *lol* ;-PIn the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood, like a hundred golden urns pouring out the sun.”Artist credit: I really tried my best to track down the artist but all I could find out is that the picture was shared again and again on pinterest. One of the people who shared it is: https://www.pinterest.com/avalonisles/ I don't have pinterest so I dunno how this works?!","”He was a marvel, shaft after shaft flying from him, spears that he wrenched easily from broken bodies on the ground to toss at new targets. Again and again I saw his wrist twist, exposing its pale underside, those flute-like bones thrusting elegantly forward. My spear sagged forgotten to the ground as I watched. I could not even see the ugliness of the deaths anymore, the brains, the shattered bones that later I would wash from my skin and hair. All I saw was his beauty, his singing limbs, the quick flickering of his feet.”

Madeline Miller studied Latin and Ancient Greek from Brown University and even more interestingly studied at the Yale School of Drama, specializing in adapting classical tales for a modern audience. I ignored this book when it first came out because I had read The Iliad twice and plan to read it many more times if the Gods grant me enough time to do so. A reimagining of Homer’s words? There is enough debate over translations of the original source documentation without adding in additional controversy over Miller’s interpretation of events. Or so I thought.After all, aren’t these books designed for a “modern audience” who will never even attempt to read Homer? I am not the target audience, as there is very little modern about me. I have ancient book dust permanently lodged in my lungs. I cough, and the air is redolent with the scent of decaying leather and the intoxicating smell of the slightly hallucinatory book fungi. Miller is doing good work, though, bringing Homer to life for a new generation. Her books are not for me. Or so I thought. When her book Galatea came out, I barely even flinched. A mild flickering of interest, but I was up to my eyeballs in books to read so I easily dissuaded myself from giving it much thought. Deciding to read Galatea would also mean that I would need to read Song of Achilles first because I do believe that books by serious authors build upon one another. I wasn’t taking Miller serious...yet. Part of my resistance came from the fact that I’m not a big fan of Achilles. He might have been ”The Greatest Warrior of his Generation,” but I didn’t find him very heroic. Now Hector, poor doomed Hector, to me he was the hero of The Iliad. I didn’t really want to read a book glorifying Achilles and how effortless it was for him to kill a hundred Trojans in one lazy, bloody afternoon. Or so I thought.

The lovely and talented Madeline Miller.I fully expected Miller to fade back into the woodwork of academia, but then this year she published Circe. With one raised Nadalesque eyebrow, I thought to myself, now Circe is someone I don’t know nearly enough about. The five star reviews started raining down on me like thunderbolts from the fingers of Zeus. Cupid shot a quiver full of arrows at me, piercing me in numerous appendages until I looked like Saint Sebastian. If I could have gotten my hands on that pink tinted, chubby, precocious toddler, I’d have turned him over my knee and paddled him with his own bow. Really, I must confess that my new found love for Achilles, Patroclus, Briseis, Chiron, Odysseus, and even Madeline Miller herself could be the result of those love poison tipped arrows. Regardless, does it matter the reason why? Even in an addled state, there is no way I would ever confuse great writing for poorly conceived writing. As I was reading through my notes and savoring favorite passages again, now that Cupid’s fog has cleared from my mind, I must say Miller is a wonderful, lyrical writer. It all begins with a rape. The Greek Gods want to reward Peleus for being such a good subject and decide that he should be given a sea nymph named Thetis as his bride. ”It was considered their highest honor. After all, what mortal would not want to bed a goddess and sire a son from her? Divine blood purified our muddy race, bred heroes from dust and clay. And this goddess brought a greater promise still: the Fates had foretold that her son would far surpass his father. Peleus’ line would be assured. But, like all the gods’ gifts, there was an edge to it; the goddess herself was unwilling.”The Gods whisper in his ear. Don’t even bother trying to woo her with kelp flowers, Aquaoir Ocean aged wine, or shrimp cocktail. The Greek Gods, being rampant assaulters of unsuspecting, pink cheeked, mortal maidens, have no compunction about advocating rape. Jump her on the beach, take her, and make her thine! The Greek Islands are lousy with half Gods. You will meet many of them in the course of this story. Achilles is the greatest of them all. Greater than Hercules. His chosen companion is Patroclus, the disgraced and banished son of a king, an odd choice in many eyes as the closest friend of the greatest warrior. Patroclus is, after all, rather unremarkable at...well...everything. It doesn’t matter, though, because Achilles is good enough at everything for the both of them. Thetis is rather annoyed at his choice. She doesn’t feel that Patroclus is good enough to spend so much time with her son. Her favorite greeting for Patroclus is: ”You will be dead soon enough.” With Patroclus being the narrator of this story, it is rather poor judgement on her part. Any quest I’ve been on I have always plied the narrator with honeyed wine and the most succulent figs in the hope that I would be rewarded in the prose and poetry of his/her telling of the tale. 

Achilles and Patroclus by Barry J.C. PurvesHomer skates around the closeness between Achilles and Patroclus, although much can be read between the lines. There is also the possibility that some homophobic Christian hundreds of years later made some deft corrections to the original, obscuring any overt reference to a homosexual relationship. Homer may have been blind, but his ears must have heard the rustling of the reed mats whether he was an “eye” witness to the Trojan War or an interpreter of events many years later. Madeline Miller wades into the sweaty bedsheet truth of the matter, and yes, the Greatest Warrior to ever live is light in his sandals. Miller puts flesh on these ancient bones, Gods and mortals alike, and brings a freshness to one of our most venerated stories. Though I resisted, it turns out that Madeline Miller was writing these books for me. She has also given me a burning desire to read The Iliad again while her interpretation is still imprinted so deeply in my mind. I have a feeling my reading experience will be deepened and her observations will glow like phosphorus between the lines.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten","1.5 stars.Aw man, where do I start with this one?I know that the big majority of people love this book. They cried and were heartbroken and it was the best thing they ever read and shit, but for me? It was just so boring. The characters were horrendous, if I wanted to read about the most useless, passive and boring narrator being in love with this attractive, golden god, dude with no personality, and when he does have one, he just turns to a selfish prick, I would reread Twilight. Seriously, can Patroclus be any more of a Bella?The writing was mediocre, the author clearly knows her stuff, but the dialogues were often ridiculous, the pacing was off. This story NEVER seemed to end. Now I wonder: how the hell does an epic tale become such a bland, flat story? Ok, confession time, I never read The Iliad. I am 90% sure I read The Odyssey twice in my school years, yup, blame it on my school to make us read the same book twice just years apart. I am, however, familiar with this story. I enjoy Greek mythology and I was all for this book and its premise. But it was just not for me.My biggest problem with the book was the characters, like I said before, they were awful characters. Patroclus is portrayed from the beginning as this weak, bland guy who can't defend himself and, throughout the book, that never changes. He is one of the most passive characters I've ever read. He is there solely to admire every physical aspect of Achilles, damn this guy had a thing for homeboy's feet. Seriously Patroclus, we get it, Achilles's feet were soft and pink and smell amazing. I got the message, and I also got how golden his skin and hair and everything in him was. Guy's hot, noted. What drove me crazy was the fact that Achilles really was the sole reason of Patroclus's existence. Without him, he didn't know how to do anything, he didn't have a reason to live and I just, ugh, really? We are going there? The whole ''if he dies, I'll die too cause there's nothing for me after him'' speech? Ugh. Even though Achilles and Patroclus had zero chemistry (seriously how many times do these guys talk, like really talk, in this book?) Do I have to believe that this good for nothing kind of guy, with no personality whatsoever, is actually the most beloved person for the best of the greeks? For this demigod? I just can't buy into this relationship that happens to be the entire focus of this book. It's like the author takes for granted that we know this is a love story between them so why bother to actually develop a relationship?Achilles, he had no personality either until almost the very end of this book and then he turns into this selfish, proud asshole that even though is letting everyone be killed and failing to notice how dumb his decision is, is still admired and revered by Patroclus... I just...this book is just so dumb sometimes.Of the story I can't say much because nothing happens. Seriously, we spend years in places and there's nothing to further the plot, it's like we are just waiting for the call against Troy. It is so boring and in this time, there's never a change in these characters. To me, the 8 years old Patroclus is the same Patroclus at the end. I don't know if it is because the story is told in past tense or if it's definitely a mistake from the author, but it reads the same. Through Patroclus's childhood, adolescence and adulthood, the character and his views feel exactly the same, which is ridiculous. For example, when all their greeks companions are dying and Achilles refuses to fight, even though Patroclus knows it's the stupidest decision ever, he refuses to say something and act, so what do they do? They both just consider to maybe swim or play later that day...  I repeat, this book can be so dumb.I don't understand Thetis role in here and why was Achilles so devoted to hear her and always obey her. Why was Achilles the perfect son, I don't understand because they clearly had a lot of issues.I can't really say more, because I would be criticizing the same things over and over. I had a lot of issues with this book, this book took me more than a month to read More than a month! A book that I was planning to finish in 4 days... It seemed like it would NEVER end. The prophecy said that Achilles would die shortly after Hector, you don't know how many times I was rooting for this dude to die so everything could end soon. JUST SOMEONE COULD PLEASE KILL HECTOR NOW.Anyway, if you liked this book, and judging by the ratings and reviews everyone and their mother loved this book, good for you! I personally had one of the most boring and frustrating experiences reading this. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the Iliad, but I sincerely doubt it. That being said, the only thing and character I truly enjoyed was Odysseus. You go, Odysseus. You da best Odysseus!"
Memoirs of a Geisha,Arthur Golden,4.16,"So.. Memoirs of a Geisha. I'd been wanting to read that one for a very long time. I had heard so many good things about it. It's supposed to be awesome, and deep, and beautiful, right? Wrong. It's not. The writing was what bothered me the most. It's pretentious and superficial, and sloooooww and it goes on and on and on and on and on and still, very little happens. In some sort of weird combination, the writing is both superficial and cliché. It feels like Golden thought it would be a good idea to emphasize all the Japan-and-nature clichés to the point of ridiculousness : I still can't believe how many times he compares something to the nature. Ironically, it doesn't feel natural at all. It feels forced and weird and and it's very annoying, as it slows down the pacing (which is already very slow) and frequently interrupts the narrator's flow of thoughts.  Examples? Yes, yes. Because I was so sick and tired of reading for the 40th time how something is LIKE a bird or a snake or whatever, I made a list. Enjoy, people. This is how Sayuri narrates the story. Please notice and enjoy how natural this way of thinking sounds : ""I felt as a dam must feel when it's holding back an entire river.""""I felt as sore as a rock must feel when the waterfall has pounded on it all day long.""""My poor scalp felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""And it goes on : ""Like water bugs kicking along the surface.""""Like the crisp skin of a grilled fish.""""Like a scrap of paper in the wind.""""Like ruts in the bark of a tree.""And on : ""Like a pig trying to survive in a slaughterhouse.""""Like a stray cat on the street without a master to feed it.""""My mind on the eve of my debut was like a garden in which the flowers have only begun to poke their faces up through the soil.""""It was like when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly.""""Out of my element as a pigeon in a nest of falcons.""""Felt as a simple smelt must feel when a silver salmon glides by.""Still not enough? I was hoping you'd say that. Here you go! : ""Like what a workman does to a field using a hoe felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""""I felt as the waves of the ocean must feel when clouds have blocked the warmth of the sun.""""As if he were the wind that blew and I were just a cloud carried upon it.""""Like a tree and its roots, or like a shrine and the gate that stands before it.""""With as much difficulty as a hungry child turns away from a plate of food.""""I felt like a slab of tuna the grocer had just delivered.""""I was like a temple bell that resonates long after it has been struck.""""I tried to imagine I was simply a house standing in the rain with the water washing down the front of me.""""Like when a stone is dropped into a pond, the water continues quivering even after the stone has sunk to the bottom.""""Like the tree where the tiger might sharpen its claws.""""Like a fish belly-up on the stream.""""A tree may look as beautiful as ever; but when you notice the insects infesting it, and the tips of the branches that are brown from disease, even the trunk seems to lose some of its magnificence.""""As much a part of her as a song is part of a bird.""""Was as simple as a stone falling toward the ground.""""If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree?""""Felt toward him just as an ice pick feels toward a block of ice.""""The two of them weren't ""spending time together"" any more than a squirrel is spending time with the insects that live in the same tree.""""Like the fisherman who hour after hour scoops out fish with his net.""""Like a mouse expecting sympathy from the snake.""""Like rice pouring from a torn sack.""""Expanding just like a river whose waters have begun to swell.""""I was like a child tiptoeing along a precipice overlooking the sea. And yet somehow I hadn't imagined a great wave might come and strike me there, and wash everything away.""""Like a snake that had spotted a mouse.""""Your eyes hang all over him like fur on a dog.""""I began to feel like a tree whose roots had at last broken into the rich, wet soil deep beneath the surface.""""Just as naturally as the leaves fall from the trees.""""Just as a stone must fall toward the earth.""""It was all like a stream that falls over rocky cliffs before it can reach the ocean.""""No more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean.""""Just like watery ink on paper.""  So yeah. Just because of that, it can't get more than 2 stars for me. It just can't. It's awful to read. And the characters. *SIGH* What can I say about them? Hatsumomo was just a big cliché, and so was Pumpkin, and so was The Chairman. They didn't feel real. None of them did. Sayuri on top. So I'm supposed to feel something for her, right? Relate to her somehow. That was impossible. I don't know why, but somehow I was able to relate to Chiyo - but not to Sayuri. Even though they're the same person, I couldn't bring myself to care for Sayuri. As soon as she ""grows up"" (even though she keeps telling her story with the skills of a freakin' 4 year old) so around the time when she becomes a geisha, that is, she becomes insufferable. And she has this sort of weird fascination for adult men, first M. Tanaka and after The Chairman, and it's just so annoying. Why does she like them? Why? And, yeah, she was also such a victim. She never made anything to change her condition, she was just this kind of submissive woman who, well, blinks and, I dunno, bows. I know it's the way she's supposed to behave, but still, it's infuriatingly boring to read about such a character. The only thing she ever does for herself is  sleeping with The Minister so she doesn't have to undergo Nabu-whathisname as a danna but even that is done in the purpose of eventually being with The Chairman. And who was he, that Chairman? Who was that man we hear about, again and again and again? What's he like? Have they ever had a real conversation? I don't think so. She idealizes him, she never sees him as who he really is, she just keeps wetting holding that stupid handkerchief every night and that annoyed me. It felt childish and weird. The only character I liked was Mameha, and she's the angel of the story, meaning that you're just supposed to like her because she's, well, perfect, kind, loyal and beautiful, the way Agnes is in David Copperfield or Melanie in Gone With The Wind.The informations about Geishas were nice, I suppose, but I don't know how much of it is true. The war was awfully, awfully boring, and very badly executed. I think you can see it was written by an American just by the way the United States are depicted. They atomically bombarded Japan and two of greatest its cities and yet, Sayuri doesn't even blink and say ""The American troups were very kind to us and gave candy to the children."" Er... Really?The plot dragged on and on, and I had to struggle to finish the book. The ending felt rushed. I hate, hate it when authors do that. He wrote a whole book about someone's life, and the final chapter is soo rushed and it goes like ""So that was forty years ago, now I'm seventy and I'm old and I'm gonna tell you what happened in my life between then and now in like, two sentences. So I married the guy I talked so much about, and then we went to live in the USA because that's like ZOMG the best country EVAR! And then he died, and.. Ah yes.. Did we have a kid? Oh, but wouldn't you like to know!.. Well you won't, cause I'm not telling you, neener- neener. Whatever I'm old, and I'm probably gonna die now LIKE A BIRD THAT FLIES AWAY"", because what would be the final sentence without a nature-related comparaison, huh? Right. I swear, the book probably deserves an award, for like Worst Ending Chapter Ever or something. It made no sense, it gave no real closure.Everything in this book was just so... flat. It tried to be epic and it tried to be a classic but it failed so badly. The characters weren't well fleshed-out, it was obvious that the Good people (Sayuri, Mahema) would triumph over the Bad (Hatsumomo), it was obvious that Sayuri would get her happy ending after all.. See, all throughout the book, I was completely disconnected, I didn't feel anything. I didn't smile, or laugh, I certainly didn't cry. I can't even say I'm angry or that I hate the book - because hatred requires that I care, and I don't. I'm just... indifferent. Bored. Unimpressed. And isn't it the worst state of mind you can possibly be in after you finish a book? Ultimately, it didn't leave a mark. So the book as a whole was a major disappointment and I'm glad it's over. I just hope the movie might be better - I kept thinking it would be better to watch it, seeing how graphic the descriptions were (of the kimonos, for example). [Edit: So I saw the movie. Meeeh.]But as a book, it was unconvincing and very flawed.","Memoirs of a Geisha is an American novel, and as such the attempt at West does East, especially on the complex and delicate subject of the geisha, is compelling, interesting, but also heavy-handed and ultimately ineffective (even more so in the case of the film). It is a wonderful introduction to geisha, Japanese culture, and the East for the uninitiated Western reader, and I can see why the book is popular, but I found it disappointing. For the reader already familiar with the culture, western influences are all too clear and the book comes off as a bit clunky and imperfect. I also had some problems with the general perception of the characters by readers versus the way the characters were actually portrayed in the book--Memoirs is far from the good-willed fairy tale that people assume it is. By all means, read it, but leave it open for critique and remember that a more authentic representation of eastern culture, especially in the details, will come from the east itself.A lot of my critique stems from the fact that this movie has attained such wide-spread fame and been made into a movie, to be sure. I feel like it is being perpetuated as something it is not. Even the introduction to the book (a faux translator's note) perpetuates the myth that Memoirs is an accurate, beautiful, in-depth reflection of the life of a geisha, when in truth it is no more that historical fiction and is written by an outsider. Golden has done his research and is well-educated on his subjects, and I have no problem with people reading from, taking interest in, and even learning from this book; I do, however, think it is important that readers don't conflate the American novel with Japanese reality. They aren't the same thing, no matter how much research Golden did, and if we take the book as an accurate representation we're actually underestimating and undervaluing geisha, Japan, and Japanese culture.Because Golden attempts to write from within the geisha culture, as a Japanese woman, he must do more than report the ""facts"" of that life--he must also pretend to be a part of it. Pretend he does, acting out a role as if he has studied inflection, script, and motivation. He certainly knows what makes writing ""Japanese"" but his attempt to mimic it is not entirely successful. The emphasis on elements, the independent sentences, the visual details are too prevalent and too obvious, as if Golden is trying to call our attention to them and thus to the Japanese style of the text. He does manage to draw attention, but to me, at least, what I came away with was the sense that Golden was an American trying really hard to sound Japanese--that is, the effect betrayed the attempt and the obvious attempt ruined the sincerity of the novel, for me. I felt like I was being smacked over the head with beauty! wood! water! kimono! haiku! and I felt insulted and disappointed.The problems that I saw in the text were certainly secondary to the purpose of the text: to entertain, to introduce Western readers to Japanese culture, and to sell books (and eventually a film). They may not be obvious to all readers and they aren't so sever that the book isn't worth reading. I just think readers need to keep in mind that what Golden writes is fiction. Historical fiction, yes, but still fiction, therefore we should look for a true representation of Japanese culture within Japanese culture itself and take Memoirs with a grain of salt.I also had problems with the rushed end of the book, the belief that Sayuri is a honest, good, modest, generous person when she really acts for herself and at harm to others throughout much of the book, the perpetuation of Hatsumomo as unjustified and cruel when she has all the reason in the world, and in general the public belief that Memoirs is some sort of fairy tale when in fact it is heavy-handed, biased, and takes a biased or unrelatistic view toward situations, characters, and love. However, all of those complains are secondary, in my view, to the major complain above, and should be come obvious to the reader.Memoirs goes quickly, is compelling, and makes a good read, and I don't want to sound too unreasonably harsh on it. However, I believe the book has a lot of faults that aren't widely acknowledged and I think we as readers need to keep them in mind. This is an imperfect Western book, and while it may be a fun or good book it is not Japanese, authentic, or entirely well done.","Like eating fancy dessert at a gourmet restaurant, Memoirs of a Geisha is beautiful, melts lightly off the tongue and will be forgotten shortly after it's done. The language is strikingly lovely, and Golden paints a remarkable picture of a time and place. If you're looking to learn something deep about the psychology of Japanese culture, or meet nuanced characters, then I'd steer you elsewhere. The story only skims the top of the more complicated aspects of a Japan in decline, focusing mostly on a genteel lifestyle that probably seems more appealing from the outside. There's a way in which the book, written by a man and a westerner, is slightly fetishistic, but less so than you might imagine.Another reader suggested that perhaps the superficiality of the story is intentional, and that the book, in a way, resembles a geisha. Beautiful and eager to please, yet too distant to really learn much from and ultimately little more than a beautiful, well-crafted object to be appreciated. If that's the case, Arthur Golden is remarkably clever, and I applaud him. If it's not the case, the book remains very pretty and an easy read."
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,"Mary Ann Shaffer, Annie Barrows",4.19,"Dear Mary Ann Shaffer,I recently read your book 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. It brought a few questions to my mind.Juliet writes in one of her letters: ""Dear Sidney, What an inspired present you sent kit - red satin tap shoes covered with sequins"" Didn't Sidney know what present he had sent?If you had to resort to sentences like these to speak what you wanted to, didn't you realize that the letter format and your writing didn't go well together?Learning from your bad example, I will quit trying to be fancy, stop this letter here and write a regular review.A Reader.** Spoiler Alert **Novel written in epistolary format. Set in post WWII England.1946.Juliet is a 30-something writer living in London. (She is like this perfect human being who is universally loved. The only people who dislike even the smallest thing about her are the evil people). One day she receives a letter from a man living on Guernsey islands who found her address on a second hand book he had. Soon Juliet is exchanging letters with the members of Guernsey literary society and people talk about what books they like and why. Then suddenly everyone forgets about the books and Guernsey people start sharing their most intimate experiences from the time during the world war with Juliet, who is only a stranger. A few weeks later Juliet goes to the Guernsey islands to meet and interview these people. Of course everyone there just loves her (except the evil woman). She stays there for a few months and decides to adopt a four year old orphan girl she met there. The girl of course loves Juliet more than the people who have raised her. And then Juliet marries a pig farmer and settles down on the Guernsey islands.So much for the ridiculous plot. (I should have just known better, just look at the cheesy title.)It shouldn't be difficult for a decent writer to develop good characters when using a letter format, since each character gets his/her own voice. However, all the characters in this book seem to talk in exactly the same manner. Be it an accomplished writer from the city of London or farmers from a remote island, their letters sound just the same. Irrespective of whether the letters are being written to a close friend or to a complete stranger. Almost all of the characters have only a single trait. For some of the characters I can't recall even a single distinct characteristic.Mary Ann tries to have everything in one book. She has grazed the surface of numerous topics like books, world war, art, nature love, bucolic life, friendship, love, homosexuality, religion and so on. None of these get more than a superficial treatment. Stories about Nazi occupation of Guernsey don't tell you anything real about the war. They just revolve around this saint of a woman who died during the war while trying to show-off her heroism. To add to this drama, halfway through the book Mary Ann shifted the focus to Juliet trying to decide between different love interests (too many people love her, you know). Why is this book being marketed a historical novel?Another one of those recent successful books that everyone is raving about. I don't get it.","Several years ago, I worked at an art gallery here in Anchorage. Though I loved the art, I wasn’t much good at selling it. More often than not, I just chatted up the customers, who were from all over the world.One night, four elderly people wandered in. They told me they were from a tiny island off the coast of southern England called “Guernsey”. I’d never heard of it, so they proudly explained it was the only part of British soil that had been occupied by the Nazis during World War II. The island was occupied for a long five years; an experience to which they had all been witnesses. At that moment, Guernsey was marked in my mind.Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrow’s new book, “The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society” is an opportunity to travel back in time to 1946 Guernsey.Beginning early 1946 in London, Juliet Ashton, a British writer, and former war journalist, is emerging from the ashes of the war to rebuild her life and her identity. She has lost her home and all her possessions, most regrettably her book collection. Out of the blue, she responds to correspondence started by a resident of Guernsey, who has managed to obtain a second-hand book once owned by Juliet, in which she had long ago written her name and address. Through this initial contact, Juliet meets an entire community, and the course of her life is redirected.Easily reminiscent of Helene Hanff’s epistolary classic, “84 Charing Cross Road”, the novel is written in the epistolary style. Shaffer and Barrow skillfully use this medium to successfully establish their characters and a solid storyline. Charming, funny, sweet, and thoughtful, “The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society” is a story that women might find more appealing than men. Yet, it is unflinching in its wartime recollections. The deprivations and devastation of the time are imaginatively and convincingly conveyed.At its core, this is a book about the love of reading, and the magic of books.I highly, highly recommend “The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society”.","Although the abrupt ending frustrated me, the rest of the book was so soothing. This is probably due to the fact it was written in letters to loved ones and not the subject matter itself, as it focuses heavily on the atrocities of WWII. Also, it's a book about books! Nothing makes me happier than reading a book about why reading is wonderful.I read this because I watched and loved the Netflix adaptation (yes, I'm that monster who sometimes watches adaptations before reading the source material). I think I may have liked the movie slightly more, not that this was bad or anything. So if you liked the book, I recommend the movie and vice versa!"
Pachinko,Min Jin Lee,4.34,"Just having finished this behemoth in the last hour, I want to put a disclaimer first. That reading this over a longer period of time than I would usually read a book, even of this length, probably made me MORE analytic than for my usual review. Or reaction. More critical. Because I truly wanted to give it a higher star value. I really did! But I cannot. So don't be scared away from reading it, because I am specific or amused for some of the tangents she took. Take it with a grain of salt. Especially if you are not the kind of reader that is bothered by vastly changing style of approach within one book. I am!The first third of this book is nearly a 5 star perfection for character development, place reality, era feel, and boding wars of surround. In cultural mix and clash, in politico straining for the working day existence in Korea (Busan) under Japanese governmental domination. Isak is a saint. His landlady and Sunja- they are sublime and so real. You know them as you have known a Scarlet O'Hara or a Dorothy in Kansas. I'll remember them. And those two married couples and their ultimate striving, movements and eventual Osaka, Japan bound lives. Leaving Korea and the death sentence that Christian belief insured. The world at war a mere background, but closer wars and constant work their every breath. And then the second third of the book. The boys' stories. Hansu, yes- but mainly the boys' years of their growing up in Osaka. The Japanese defeat years within Japan with their Korean ethnicity. This is clear and yet convoluted. Not linear and direct as the first part. But yet, it is 4 star in the friends of each, the characters of mentoring, the parents and the Aunties' core purposes. The differences of languages and custom and most of all- for association and work. It's a good wider tale, and well done, kept my interest. Which gives out eventually in this parsing for a wider look at Osaka and the upcoming Pachinko connections for family support. Just a game in a parlor! But in doing so, the epic length and detail for this family is becoming broader, although shallower- much like a river near its delta- it's becoming defused and silt laden. The pure core of clearness for the first Korean situation is getting more progressively lost.And then the last third of the book from the late 1960's onward to its conclusion! This is barely a 2.5 star read. It jumps. Relationship and context become abrupt. Many tangent issues of intersect to the story become sketchy. Is this new character or that one introduced to merely become an example for a group label or thesis issue? We find none of the individual character self-realizations or deep core connection coming from text connotation or the visuals (as went so beautifully within the first third of the book). But instead any clarity, if any, is coming from conversations of the bemoaning failure or nasty hanger on. Dialog becomes harsh. Style is jagged and changes abruptly as well. Description quickly becoming 10 pages of angst or venting conversation for a character who is then ""dealt out"" of the context or continuation of this plotting within a mere 3 lines somewhere in the next chapter? Huh!Whatever was the style causation for this last third of the book- it was a mistake. She had too much to say? The grandchildren's stories should have been a separate book. The great-grandson's with the ultimate Phoebe dichotomy QUESTION of vast location decision for identity of placement- the crux pivot. This decision on where to live FOR that identity of the individual- quite another whole book. That last would have made a great story if she would have followed the style of nuance and purity for those first 2 couples who lived within Busan and knew who they were. That one could have potential to be superb. Not added within 3 paragraphs, or as an afterthought for a partial closure.So- how do you judge this book? Not in 40 words, that's for sure.I enjoyed the first half much more than the last. But I did read every word and read this slowly. There was an absolute intrigue for me- to answer a question ""to or for"" myself about how these people would ""self-describe"". Are they Korean? Are they Japanese. They hold passports from South Korea, even those who have never been there. And getting Japanese citizenship? Well, you decide if that is a realistic possibility. Japanese want to be ""the same"" at their very cores- difference can and does equate to unmannerly and ""wrong"". As much as I did enjoy the factual minutia of these times and places, and the mix of modes and fads displayed by those who lived them. I also became quite aware that this essentially, in the last 50 or 60 pages of the book- holds a very anti-Japanese animus. Which became more and more openly revealed. I would say it is a prejudice, just as equal to the one the Japanese held for Noa.So I can only give it 3 stars. It's a tremendous effort. Places and characters here are often superbly detailed. Min Jin Lee just bit off far more than she could chew, IMHO. Trying to get every victim or condition ""label"" issued for a human being since the middle of the last century into some action or subplot was also not a wise move.","Alright, after thinking about this one for the last 24 hours or so, I think I've figured out how to articulate what I didn't like about it.But first I want to start with the stuff I did really enjoy. The book taught me a lot about the dynamic between Koreans & Japanese, especially in the early to mid-20th century. I had no idea about any of the historical context within which this book was set. And I found learning about it, especially as the author traced these themes and historical elements through the lives of her main characters, to be a fascinating experience and probably one of the most educational novels I've read in a while. The attention to detail was also excellent. I felt like the author created really grounded settings for the characters, and I enjoyed seeing how she moved the story forward with historical shifts and how that reflected in the fate of her characters' lives.Alternatively, that same thing I enjoyed sort of ruined the experience for me. Because she covers SO much history and SO many characters—in, albeit, a quite lengthy book (nearly 500) pages—I never felt connected to anyone in particular. I thought it started out alright, picked up around page 80 and stayed strong for the remainder of that section. But then we jumped in time so much and through so many characters, that I never understood why I should care about them, only that they were related to previous characters. Yaa Gyasi's  Homegoing does something similar, but her time period shifts are consistent and contained, and there is a more linear and clear understanding of how and why she is moving the story along in that way. With Pachinko we moved from character to character through the years with no real explanation as to why we are back with them. So I'm left wondering, ""what about that other character? Where did they go? When will we see them again, if ever?"" And on top of that, she literally ends chapters or sections of the book with something along the lines of [not a real spoiler, just an example]: ""And then he died."" And we find out in the next chapter that 5 years have passed, we are seeing everything from some other characters perspective, all this stuff in their lives has changed, and the dead character is briefly mentioned and never returned to. I found it frustrating to follow, ultimately unsatisfying, and a sort of cheap way to tell a story. It's like she tried to inject all the drama of these big life events—pregnancies, death, runaway family members, etc.—without justifying or following through with any of it.The writing style was very straight forward. It suited the story since overall it was a detached 3rd person telling the narrative of the generations of this family and their lives. But I didn't find the writing to be compelling enough to look forward to picking up the book. If I don't have either amazing characters or plot, I want really good writing, and this was just okay.I know a ton of people have loved this book and given it 4 or 5 stars, but I just didn't feel that way about it. Maybe it was overhyped for me, and in combination with the things I've said above it just didn't affect me in the same way. But I'm glad others are enjoying it, and if you aren't bothered by those elements in a story you will probably really enjoy this. It definitely has a lot of stuff going on, is clearly well-researched and sweeping, but I felt like it didn't have enough of a thread to convince me to pull for it. It just ended up unraveling as it went along and I lost interest.","History has failed us, but no matter.
Look, I get it. A lot of people won't be interested in this book because they have no idea what pachinko means and what exactly is going on with that cover, anyway? We are highly susceptible to marketing techniques and the cover and title give us pretty much nothing. But hear me out for a minute because this book is really good.This is a historical family saga set in Korea and Japan throughout the 20th century. It follows four generations of a Korean family through the political turmoil of Japanese colonization, the hardship of wartimes, seeking a new and better life in Japan, and witnessing the home they left become divided into two countries they hardly recognize. As someone who knows very little about Korean history, this book was absolutely fascinating. Rich, detailed characterization draws us into the lives of these people and, at least for me, teaches us a chapter of modern history we might not have been aware of.Many Koreans found themselves forced to move to Japan to find jobs for their families, but they faced discrimination and disgusting living conditions when they arrived. Pachinko, we soon find out, is a kind of Japanese arcade game, and working in a pachinko parlor was considered a typical job for a Korean looking to get ahead. Many Japanese looked down upon pachinko parlor workers, viewing them as shady and dishonest - or just, you know, Korean.
And this is something Solomon must understand. We can be deported. We have no motherland. Life is full of things he cannot control so he must adapt. My boy has to survive.
It was both interesting and deeply saddening to hear about what these people went through, how easy it was for Koreans to be imprisoned indefinitely without trial. And after years of hardship and discrimination, after pushing through and finally earning enough money to have stability, many could never go back. Korean-Japanese (third, fourth, fifth generation even) were refused citizenship in Japan but most came from North Korea, a place they could no longer safely return to.This is both a fictional and a true story. The fictional characters the author creates come sparking off the page - from the resilient Sunja who once foolishly believed in the love of an older man, to Noa who will never quite recover from the dishonor of his lineage, to Solomon who is still trying to escape the negative stereotypes associated with Koreans many years after his grandmother arrived in Japan. And it is a true story because much of this book was the reality for many Koreans.A deeply affecting read and a look at an area of history oft-forgotten outside of East Asia.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
A Gentleman in Moscow,Amor Towles,4.32,"Tears were streaming down my face the last several pages. Turning each page slower - and slower - breathless - filled with gratitude- overwhelmed by what this rare book offers and then delivering a wonderful satisfying ending......to the already - rich- wonderful-absolutely marvelous novel. Goose bumps and butterfly fluttering.....the writing is pulsing with life. Amor Towles'sleading man....""Count Rostov"" ....[Alexander Ilyich Rostov]....or ""Sasha"", to a select few old friends, is THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL male character to come along in recent literature. I can't think of any other male character with the type of astounding dignity that 'Count Rostov' exhibits. I was either losing sleep reading this book, tossing out all other daytime plans to continue, reading....or I was obsessively thinking about this book when I wasn't reading it. My early thoughts were about Russia and the how the Bolsheviks came into power.....and the years that followed. Russia became symbolic of the spread of communism throughout the world.....resulting in the end of all aristocracy ----So....Not only was Rostov's aristocracy being stripped away, but his self expression and freedom of speech was being taken from his as well. He wrote poetry.....and a poem called ""Where Is It Now"".....[I thought about this interesting title for some time]. As in where does Court Rostov stand now? Rostov ""has succumbed irrevocably to the corruptions of his class"", according toThe People's Commissariat For Internal Affairs in Moscow 1922. I kept thinking - isn't it 'somewhat' an odd punishment to be given a life sentence of confinement to the walls inside a hotel? A grand hotel at that-- The Metropol Hotel. I mean ""Eloise"" .... in the Plaza Hotel in New York City was happy, but she was free to step outside. The Count's sentence is clear. Should he step outside the Hotel at any time, he will be shot-killed! I lost a few hours of my mind -- thinking 'only' about this. Why? What else were choices of punishment for an aristocrat if not killed? Did they have prisons? And - where was his money coming from? Was food included without him paying for it in the restaurants in the hotel? How on earth could he possibly earn money? Buy clothes? Essentials? - For the rest of his life? How will he spend his time - and keep sane? I was simply curious. And most -- how might I have behaved if I were in the counts situation? I'd like to think I might have stood tall- held my dignity - be the gentle woman - as Alexander was a GRAND GENTLEMAN. The Count was a fabulous human being....a man I would love to have shared a glass of wine with. He was classy - witty- wise - intelligent- charming and kind. There are endless likable characteristics about Alexander. He was generous with his soul. Count Rostov's days of writing poetry were behind him. He moved into a small room on the sixth floor in the attic. He was moved out of his luxury suite that he had lived in for four years in the past. Most of his 'valuable' books were back in Paris...but he kept one book that once belonged to his father -one he never had found time to read. ""The Essays of Montaigne"". He will finally have time to read Michael de Montaigne' essays now ---who was one of the most significant philosophers of the French renaissance known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. In the first few weeks of living in the Metropol Hotel-- Alexander holds himself high - has no interest in bitterness ---GOD I LOVED THIS MAN---and quietly stayed in his room, reading, and reflecting. He ate his meals in either of the two restaurants: the Boyarsky or the Piazza. Count Rostov being a wine and food connoisseur, is a treat for us readers - as the descriptions of the food and wine are mouthwatering-savory-and scrumptious. The way the tables were set -the waiters and chef add to delightful glory as well. I could smell and taste the fish, while visualizing the seating in the dining room. As for the conversations......Well....in steps nine year old Nina Kulikova. Too adorable for words -right off the bat!!!She's quite the conversationalist!!! She's living in the hotel with her father -and seems to have spare time for wandering. Their lovely friendship begins over lunch in the Piazza. Nina - of course - invites herself to Alexander's table by simply pulling up a chair, sitting down, and staring at his food. Their friendship continues when Nina manages to coerce Court Rostov into joining her in one of her many hidden excursions. SPYING into the secret passageways and locked rooms with the stolen key she has. So 'how' does a precocious nine-year-old coerce a grown man to sneak around a hotel with her? Nina says:""Oh come along"" ""I'd rather not"" ""Don't be such a fuddy-duddy"".  ""I'm not a fuddy-duddy"". ""Can you be so sure?"" ""A man can never be entirely sure that he is not a fuddy-duddy. That is axiomatic to the term"".  ""Exactly"". Off they go! One minute Nina is interested in knowing the rules of being a princess ( as when they first met in the restaurant), and the next moment she is enthralled by the assembly's energy and sense of purpose...( from when they are listening in on the Assemblies political discourse). Nina is a wonderful companion - and because of their spy games, Alexander was able to listen to other 'fuddy-duddy's' discuss political and social changes. Over the years - three decades at Hotel Metropol--Alexander makes many friends and acquaintances. His closest friends with the staff are: Andrey, maitre d' of the Boyarsky, Emile the Chef - Vasily the concierge and Marina the seamstress. His old friend from Imperial University in St. Petersburg comes to visit him. MikhailFyodorovich (Mishka), was in town to help plan the inaugural congress of RAPP. Such a lovely friendship these two men shared. The Count took pleasure in his old friends romantic skirmish; yet felt a sting of envy. Anna Urbanova a celebrity actress ....becomes a between-the-sheets friend. Other people come and go ---Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov is a former colonel of the Red Army- whom Alexander has many political conversations with.... and not only about Russia, but the rest of the world. They watch and discuss the movie Casablanca--- and the symbolism is achingly beautiful. Yet.....Out of all the people who come and go - it's Nina who has Alexander's heart the most.A time comes when she does leave the hotel - but then she comes back years later for a brief visit - a visit that will alter Alexanders life. Alexander Ilyich Rostov: somehow this man knew that life was never meant to be a struggle. If only I could learn from him. As The Count learned from his ancestors.....""If a man does not master his circumstances he is bound to be mastered by them"".A Masterpiece! One of the most phenomenal book books in 'years'. It's Nov. - almost Thanksgiving: I've read so many outstanding books this year it's ridiculously crazy-terrific. 2016 has been a year of favorite books....but ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" tops them all! Amor Towles delivered as a gift!","Vyshinsky: Why did you write the poem?Rosov: It demanded to be written. I simply happened to be sitting at the particular desk on the particular morning when it chose to make its demands.Vyshinksy: And where was that exactly?Rostov: In the south parlor at Idlehour.Vyshinksy: Idlehour?Rosov: The Rostov estate in Nizhny Novgorod.Vyshinksy: Ah, yes. Of course. How apt. But let us return our attention to your poem. Coming as it did-in the more subdued years after the failed revolt of 1905--many considered it a call to action. Would you agree with that assessment?Rosov: All poetry is a call to action.

Hotel Metropol, MoscowThis is just a snippet from the appearance of Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov before the Emergency Committee of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs on 21 June 1922. Rostov was a member of the wrong class and a ""poet"", as well. He was destined for a firing squad or an all expense paid trip to Siberia where he could still end up with a bullet in his head. The way the Russians were deciding who was a threat to their new nation and the proper punishment to be enforced per case was so arbitrary and inconsistent that it was impossible to anticipate what your fate was going to be once you came before the Committee. Luckily for all of us, Rostov received a rather unusual punishment. He was put under hotel arrest for the rest of his life. He could not set foot outside the walls of the Metropol Hotel or he would be executed immediately. Given the alternatives, having to live in this grand hotel for the rest of his life was actually a gift. It was a microcosm of a city with a barbershop, clothing stores, and restaurants readily available for a man with discerning needs. He would finally have time to read, though he had left his books in Paris when he decided to come back to Russia and was now stuck with the dusty tomes of his father. They had different tastes. He periodically made a stab at reading his father’s favorite book of Montaigne, but soon discovered it was the perfect height to level his table. Of course, the beautiful room with the balcony that had plenty of space for his family possessions was taken away from him. He was relocated to a small room in the attic. He was constricted, but alive.I was only a few pages in before I knew that the Count and I were not only going to be the best of friends, but that he was also going to be a model for how a man of honor should conduct himself. Here is an example of the Count telling us to reevaluate how we see the people we meet:”After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we’ve just met for a minute in the lobby of the hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration--and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.”We do have to make a lot of snap judgements about people. Rarely are they all that accurate, though it is amazing how difficult it is to erase and rewrite the first impression we have of someone. I’ve been surprised more than once by discovering the depth of someone whom I thought was a shallow nincompoop. We’ve all felt the sting of people judging us too harshly or seeing us for someone less than who we are. I’ve experienced people actually loathing me, leaving me baffled as to what I could have possibly done to induce this level of animosity. Of course, it has to be some misconception, but nearly impossible to fix once they’ve locked me up with the other criminals in the dark, damp cells of their mind. The Count always erred on the side of trusting too much rather than condemning someone too hastily. He was such a contrast to the new government who judged quickly and harshly with no compassion or consideration for circumstances. After all, Count Rostov was the last gentleman in Moscow, most of the rest having fled or been shot. He never forgot his breeding or his place in the world even if his universe had shrunk to the size of a city block. His best friend Mishka, a poet, floated in and out of his life. He brought with him the golden memories of their childhood. They could reminiscence about the days of young adulthood when life was a pear, and the juice ran down their chins, and the sticky nectar of shared experiences was a fragrance that filled the room around them. Those were the days, as fleeting as they proved to be. The Count was not lonely. After all, this was a grand hotel with new people coming and going every day, and there were even some people who elected to stay on a more permanent basis, like say an aging, but still beautiful starlet. ”After taking a quick look around, the Count crossed the empty sitting room and entered the bedchamber, where a willowy figure stood in silhouette before one of the great windows. At the sound of his approach, she turned and let her dress slip to the floor with a delicate whoosh….”How may I be of service madam?Not that there was ever a question of his character, but when a friend dropped a child, a girl, into his care, he proved remarkably adept at the task of raising this child. What was supposed to be a few months turned into decades. He loved her as if she were his own.

The author Amor Towles at the Metropol Hotel in MoscowAmor Towles’s first book  Rules of Civility was one of my favorite books I read that year. There is no sophomore slump with his second book. This is a charming book lyrically written. So spend a few hours with Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov and see how to live a good life despite being made a caged bird. If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten","It’s always a shock, after you finish a particularly good book, to look up and see the world go about its business with perfect indifference, while you sit there, feeling that something has shifted, moved, broken open inside you. This is how I felt when I finished A Gentleman in Moscow, emerging from my trance of reading with a sense of unbearable unreality. Like I couldn’t remember being on my own bed, in my own room, the way one might feel when they're driving home and suddenly find one's self in front of the garage, unable to remember the actual drive. The story begins when Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov is unceremoniously sentenced to life imprisonment in Moscow’s Metropol hotel. And for all that it is a prison, it is a luxurious one. The year is 1922, and behind it all, looms the haunting specter of a country that is at the fragile end of a brutal history: an ill-timed glance or a foot set in an unfortunate spot can bring down death and woe upon anyone, in the form of a bullet to the head or an exile to Siberia. Alexander Ilyich Rostov, however, finds a fire, a ferocious brightness in this new existence. The Hotel Metropol is a world unto itself, and within its walls, “the world,” has indeed, “come and gone”. Over the years, Alexander forges a link between him and several residents of the hotel—the chefs, the doormen, the bartenders, the seamstresses—and creates a door that he can knock at and count on being opened at any time. But soon, the long years begin to press into Alexander’s life from every angle, and he begins to feel, for the first time, the true weight of his sentence. The fear that he wouldn’t ever leave the hotel, that he would stay and grow old and bent and be put in the ground there, is now a constant echo knifing through the count’s thoughts. The hotel is Alexander’s prison, and it is his sanctuary, but for how much longer can it be either?
 To what end, he wondered, had the Divine created the stars in heaven to fill a man with feelings of inspiration one day and insignificance the next?
To set up a story of imprisonment within an unchanging setting and make it feel so hugely mesmerizing for several hundred pages couldn’t have been an easy feat. But in this novel, Towles, proving himself a maestro of his craft, sets off all the fireworks he can with it, and the resulting narrative, like the count, thrives in captivity.I absolutely loved this book. There are so many things this novel does well that are worth to dwell on for several pages: like the beauty of the prose and how Towles pulls the reader deep into the currents of his language and makes us want to linger, like the gorgeously realized setting and the propulsive plot and how I had to marshal my tired eyes in order to see the pages, driving myself past exhaustion to a kind of surreal and tenacious wakefulness because I just couldn't. stop. reading. Like the author’s voice: the arched eyebrow, the confiding tone, the piercing irony, and the craftiness with which the author always seems to know the right nerve to touch, at exactly the right moment, to wound or to excite or to outrage most. But what appealed to me personally in this novel was the character-work and the deep thematic currents that run through A Gentleman in Moscow. This is a novel with an abundance of things to say, with profound moving ruminations on selfhood, friendship, parenthood and the devastating unattainability of modest hopes. It is a novel driven so fiercely and so clearly by a deep urge to make observations about people, to see them, truly see them, and in turn, let them see themselves in all their glorious and sometimes mundane glory. The resulting narrative is an emotionally and intellectually rewarding experience; people, after all (to borrow some of the count's own words) “deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration.” And people lay at the heart of this book:  A Gentleman in Moscow is a novel that thrives with the people it focuses on, who are richly drawn, and who, together, make something like the word family. Starting with the count, whose character and life at the Hotel Metropol are so vividly painted for the reader. Alexander has such a strong presence to him, as though he breathes all the air on the page and only leaves enough for other characters by benevolence only, and it's a treat to simply spend time with him. I loved his dignity, his steadiness, his sense of humor, his heartbreaking thoughtfulness, and how he manages to preserve those qualities despite his circumstances. Alexander takes joy in savoring the simple pleasures of life—good wine, good company, and a good book. He charms people, and lets himself be charmed by them, making for some really captivating interactions with other characters. There's Nina, the precocious 9-year-old who holds a master key which allows her into every room; Emile, the grouchy cook with his caustic whit and cavernous gloom; and Andrey, the French maître d’ with a preternatural knowledge of the hotel’s inner workings and preternaturally agile hands. Their presence was like a warm stone the count cupped in his hands, and I really relished the feeling that their solitudes had joined together, canceled each other's out. There is tragedy at the heart of this story, after all, but there is also so much ineffable tenderness—and this what follows the reader off the page.


“These are the greatest of conveniences, Anushka—and at one time, I had them all. But in the end, it has been the inconveniences that have mattered to me most.”

It comes as no surprise to me that this novel was a hugely popular hit, and I’m so glad I read it. If you’re worried this may not be your thing—like I initially was—trust me: A Gentleman in Moscow is more than your thing, and I've no doubt you will enjoy your time here."
The Other Boleyn Girl,Philippa Gregory,4.09,"Some people (read: uptight history nerds with nothing better to do) like to get their undies in knots over Philippa Gregory's writing and whine about how she takes too many liberties with history. Well, guess what? She makes it interesting, and since her books are classified as fiction, I think she can be allowed that. Also, I consider myself a history nerd, especially when it comes to the Tudors, and I think Gregory's books are great. The stories surrounding Henry VIII are already really good; all Philippa Gregory did was add dialogue and sex scenes that your history teachers pretended never happened. I was also very grateful that she didn't attempt to garner sympathy for Anne Boleyn. I've read a couple novels about her where the author attempts to portray her as an innocent victim and it's just sad. The woman was a manipulative, conniving, intelligent, confident bitch, and The Other Boleyn Girl makes this very clear.Other books in Philippa Gregory's Tudor series that I read and enjoyed: The Virgin's Lover, The Queen's Fool, The Constant Princess, and The Boleyn Inheritance.","Disclaimer: Don't confuse this book with a biography of Mary Boleyn. It's fiction all the way. It's a good read when you remember that this is fiction and not a blow-by-blow account of historical events. And because it is fiction, Gregory is able to play a little fast and loose with historical fact. Mary was most likely the oldest Boleyn child, not the youngest as presented here. She had also served the French kings court, just as Anne did, but was sent home in disgrace after tales of her promiscuity got out, including the fact that she was probably also that king's mistress. She was probably not the young, inexperienced girl Gregory chooses to portray her as. Gregory also depends heavily on Retha Warnicke's thesis that a homosexual ring surrounded Anne and included her brother George. This has been widely discredited by historians, since both Anne and George were very religious, and George was also a renowned womanizer. Otherwise, it was a decent book. There were parts I thought went a little far, especially with Mary and George teaching Anne ""whore's tricks"" to woo the king without actually having sex with him. Granted, activity like this may have happened, but I don't necessarily want to read about it. I loved the love story between Mary and William Stafford, and would have liked to seen more of the relationship between Anne and Henry, when they were younger, seemingly in love, and she was as much a partner and advisor in his affairs as king (especially in religious thinking and such) as any man at court. Somehow though, this book has tarnished my romanticized concept of courtly behavior. It's horrifying to consider that some of the political wrangling and the use of women as temptations, mistresses, and pawns to rise in society, titles, and the court probably happened, at least to some extent. If this was the way life was in those days, I would hope that I was a commoner. Because being in the court and used as someone's chattel to get what they wanted with no regard for my desires or who I loved would have been awful.","I picked this one up at work because I want to see the movie (hello, Scarlett Johansen and Natalie Portman? Yes please), and because I know I'll have thousands of people asking me about it, like with Atonement, which I never read. In short, this book sucks. It's the worst kind of historical fiction - light on the history, and not fun or well written to make up for it. The characters are one dimensional, the writing is trite and full of cliches. Complete trash, but I'm not putting it on my enjoyable trash shelf, because it's not particularly enjoyable. The worst thing about this book was how blatantly obvious it was that Gregory hates Anne Boleyn. Mary may have been the narrator, but Anne was without doubt the main character, and it is impossible to enjoy a book where the author goes all out to make you hate the main character. Especially a badly written main character. Anyone who has done any literary criticism, or any writing, will know that good characterisation involves showing, not telling. We're told how charming and witty Anne is to the King, but we're shown her being a bitch and arguing with Mary. Anne would have been a much more effective character if she'd been written like her brother George (the only likeable character in the whole book), who IS charming and witty, will stab you in the back if it suits him, but then admit to it with a disarming honesty. If she'd been charming but manipulative to everyone, including Mary, her seduction of the King would have been much more plausible, but as it was I just couldn't see it. Then there's the way Gregory manipulates historical fact in order to make Anne seem worse. Anne was clever, and well educated, all we got from that was that she spoke French and read a lot, but in reality her education and ability to discuss politics and serious issues with Henry was a significant attraction. And there was the love affair with Henry Percy. Anne admits to her sworn enemy that she has slept with her betrothed, and he says, no you didn't because it isn't politically convenient for you to marry him and later doesn't tell the king even when he's in a precarious political position because of Anne. WTF plothole??Next we have the incest and the witchcraft, both of which Gregory paints as true. No, seriously. As far as incest goes, well, who the hell would sleep with their own brother? Apart from the fact that it's generally acknowledged that it was just a means of getting rid of them. As for witchcraft, well she was a devout Christian, and again, it's generally thought to be a convenient pretext. The whole enmity between sisters thing is a creation, which would be fair enough, poetic license, dramatic tension, etc etc. Except Mary hates Anne, and yet she's always doing what she's told, helping Anne out, blah blah. She'll occasionally say that of course she loves her she's her sister, but we're told far more often and with far more vehemence how much she hates her, and all we're shown is the fights and the vindictiveness. Again, this is mostly because Gregory hates Anne. She seems to like Mary, although if the real Mary was anything like the characterisation then I can't see why. Gregory's Mary is insipid, whiny and spineless, and pretty much irritates the hell out of me. And then we get the whole ""wanting to marry for love and not power as a feminist statement"" thing that Gregory does with Mary, while we are told Anne, who had power and intelligence in her own right, is a spineless pawn in a man's game of politics. She couldn't possibly have been regent of England without her uncle's help, we are told. This of the woman who split the church, dethroned a queen, and was mother to Queen Elizabeth.In the Author's note Gregory cites Retha Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn as one of her main sources, which according to Wikipedia (I know, Wikipedia, but still), is generally considered to be unsubstantiated which explains some of this. She also expresses admiration for Queen Elizabeth I, which I found rather ironic considering she is Anne's daughter and Anne and Elizabeth seem to me to have been very similar in character as well as ability."
The French Honeymoon,Anne-Sophie Jouhanneau,3.27,"From the evocative setting to the multiple distinct POVs, The French Honeymoon had me captivated from beginning to end. I mean, who doesn’t love a story centered around forbidden love and a dysfunctional family? Starting—and ending—with quite the bang, the many subtle clues happily failed to tip me off to either of the two staggering, mind-blowing twists, both of which left my jaw on the floor. While I normally manage to guess at least part of each suspense/thriller that I read, this whole finely tuned plot managed to evade my armchair sleuthing right up until the open-ended conclusion.With plenty of dark schemes, underhanded manipulation, and juicy drama, this fast-paced plot could do no wrong in my humble opinion. After all, thanks to three morally gray characters who ran the gamut from mildly cheer-worthy to the kind you love to hate, I got swept up in their plot-charging drama as soon as I met them. And let me tell you, those personas were really something. Incredibly well-developed, their backgrounds filled in their motivations and desires, creating individuals that felt utterly real as well as believably flawed. Oh. And, of course, beyond twisted.All said and done, I’m now a whopping great fan of Ms. Jouhanneau. With precise plotting that spun tales within tales, the edge-of-your-seat suspense only grew more intense with each page. Add in the unreliable narrators and the original premise, and I couldn’t stop myself from binge-reading this popcorn thriller in only a matter of hours. So if you’re looking for a “thriller-lite” read that will keep your attention, grab this adult debut novel ASAP. After all, who can pass up a little vacation time in Paris all while being entertained by some spot-on characters and their dastardly deeds? Rating of 4.5 stars.SYNOPSIS:This is not how she imagined it, any of it. Taylor Quinn arrives at her honeymoon suite in the City of Love alone, sans suitcase, but with wads of stolen cash. When she catches a glimpse of newlyweds Cassie and Olivier enjoying their happily ever, she can't tear her eyes away. And Cassie makes their antics easy to follow as she reveals every detail of their picture-perfect trip on social media. Taylor's obsession builds as she tracks their every move. This was the kind of life she was supposed to be living, this was the marriage she should have had, this was the honeymoon she dreamed of.The illusion is shattered when she overhears a heated argument between Cassie and Olivier, which reveals that they're not the lovestruck couple they pretend to be. But Cassie and Olivier have agendas of their own and Taylor can't see the danger in getting in the middle of this until it's too late. And now, no one will get out of Paris unscathed.Thank you to Anne-Sophie Jouhanneau and Sourcebooks Landmark for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: April 15, 2025Content warning: stalking, infidelity, being drugged, murder","“Sometimes, Paris is a terrible idea.”The cover and the synopsis pulled me in, but the slow-burn, character-driven story wasn’t enough for me to get lost in the narrative. I think being on the top end of the Gen-X classification means that I view the whole ‘picture perfect life’ so many Millennials and Gen-Z are striving to portray, as laughable. I also like a tautly paced suspense novel that keeps my heart rate elevated and my mind reeling. Keep this in mind when you give weight to my review. I can’t put my finger on what was missing to make this book memorable for me. The beautiful descriptions of macarons from Laduree had me drooling and wishing I was able to get my hands on a box containing such a “festival of colors.” The mystery and the twist had potential. I was curious about marriage fraud, a honeymoon gone wrong and even more about how newlyweds could be so bent on murder after only knowing each other briefly. It wasn’t the characters; I enjoy reading about unlikeable characters. It wasn’t the ending; I enjoy ambiguous endings where I can surmise what could have happened with the windfall. I think it comes down to the uneven pacing; it ruined the impact for me. This book had me appreciating my relationship and my marriage. I realize that I want to be careful with my expectations. I don’t want the fantasy version I portray or imagine to overshadow reality. I also want to question the motives for my social media presence. The execution may be lacking in my opinion, but the story certainly has potential.","Moral of the story: Don't post live location updates on social media (duh).Surprised to see a French author portraying Paris in such a cliché way, but maybe this is because most of the story is written from the POV of two very unlikeable Americans. However, even in the French character's POV some things were overexplained: -""The tax office—the French equivalent of the IRS""-""Football (European football I mean, aka soccer)""This thriller was short and had enough surprises to keep the reader's interest. The ending was also open to interpretation, which I enjoyed. Thank you to the author, Netgalley & Sourcebooks Landmark for the eARC!"
The Last Session,Julia Bartz,3.00,"Julia Bartz delivers a compelling and atmospheric tale in The Last Session, a locked-room thriller that masterfully intertwines psychological suspense with deeper themes of trauma, healing, and human connection. Thea, a social worker haunted by her past, is thrust into a disturbing web of secrets when a catatonic patient unexpectedly connects her to long-buried memories. What begins as a professional pursuit quickly transforms into a personal journey as Thea infiltrates a mysterious retreat in the deserts of New Mexico, uncovering truths that challenge both her beliefs and her sanity.The novel is a vivid exploration of the interplay between trauma and self-discovery, with Bartz crafting an unsettling yet immersive atmosphere that keeps readers on edge. The remote retreat setting is both alluring and menacing, with its charismatic leaders and unconventional methods pushing Thea—and the reader—toward uncomfortable revelations. As the exercises grow more intense, the tension rises, and Bartz deftly balances the suspense with introspective moments that delve into Thea’s psyche.While the pacing is brisk and the twists are plentiful, the story occasionally veers into implausible territory, requiring a suspension of disbelief, particularly regarding Thea's decisions as a professional. However, this is offset by the novel’s ability to hold the reader’s attention with its unpredictable turns and rich, layered characters. Thea’s vulnerability and determination make her a relatable protagonist, even when her actions border on questionable.Themes of cult-like dynamics, the ethics of mental health care, and the lingering effects of childhood trauma add depth to the narrative. Bartz’s nuanced portrayal of these issues elevates the book beyond a simple thriller, offering thought-provoking commentary on the lengths people will go to confront their past and protect those they care about.Despite some uneven pacing and a slightly rushed conclusion, The Last Session is a dark and compelling read that will appeal to fans of psychological suspense and locked-room mysteries. With its eerie setting, complex themes, and gripping plot, it’s a book that lingers long after the final page.A huge thank you to NetGalley and Atria Books | Atria/Emily Bestler Books for sharing this wild ride's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter<","My thanks to Atria Books, Julia Bartz and Netgalley.So, I just reviewed this 2 minutes ago, and it got deleted. By Netgalley. Fine. This had better not be some new shit. Does Amazon now own Netgalley?Not going through the review again.I enjoyed this book. Damned ole' messed up cults! Honestly, my main thought was about the sad sacks that fall for this type of shit.Hell, I rejected my Christian upbringing when I was in the sixth grade! There's conspiracy theories and then there's me.I'll admit that I expected to love this, mostly because I loved Julia's last book. This was good, but not what I was looking for.Doesn't matter. Bartz already won me over with her first book. She's got a fan in me!3 1/2 stars rounded down.","A dark and twisted tale that explored some serious themes, The Last Session took me on a twisty ride of unexplored trauma, disturbing cult behaviors, and life-altering secrets. Starting off with an empathetic view of the mental health system, I was pulled in by the social worker protagonist and her genuine nature. Thea’s flawed persona quickly pulled me in deep along with her mysterious past and many dark secrets. But it was the rest of the cast of characters that really did me in. Running the gamut from merely suspect to a few I loved to hate, my eyes got their workout in as I looked upon them all with full-blown suspicion. As for the plot, I was head over heels for the first half of the novel. An original premise with an even pace and ratcheting foreboding, I was somewhat disappointing when Thea went to the retreat. At that point all bets were off as this locked room thriller became more and more unhinged. Part of me loved it immensely although I could have done without the sexually explicit scenes. Spicy for this non-romance reader, it wasn’t really my thing. That being said, I relished the increasingly claustrophobic feel as the plot circled closer and closer to the deliciously over-the-top climax where everything seemed to go off the rails.All in all, Julia Bartz still managed to pull me in yet again. Compelling, suspenseful, and filled with edge-of-your-seat tension, there was no guessing what was coming in that twisted, twisted conclusion. So despite the clear need to suspend all disbelief, I would say that I was mostly won over even with the paranormal thread running throughout the novel. After all, the well-developed characters and perfectly plotted storyline showed off this author’s masterful skill. So if you’re looking for a delightfully deranged premise filled with an amateur sleuth caught in a cult’s antics, this book is most definitely for you. Rating of 4 stars.SYNOPSIS:When a catatonic woman shows up at the psychiatric unit, social worker Thea swears she knows her from somewhere. She’s shocked to discover the patient holds a link to a traumatic time in her past. Upon regaining lucidity, the patient claims she can’t remember the horrific recent events that caused her brain to shut down. Thea’s at a loss—especially when the patient is ripped away from her as suddenly as she appeared.Determined to find her, Thea follows a trail of clues to a remote center in Southwestern New Mexico, where a charismatic couple holds a controversial monthly retreat to uncover attendees’ romantic and sexual issues. Forced to participate in increasingly intimate exercises, Thea finds herself inching closer not only to her missing patient, but also to tantalizing answers about her harrowing past. However, time is running out, and if she stays for the last session, she too might lose her mind…or worse.Thank you to Andrea Bartz and Emily Bestler Books/Atria for my complimentary copy.

Society of Lies,Lauren Ling Brown,3.53,"3 very generous stars
I am not gonna say much about this book because I honestly have nothing much to say. I don't have anything to rant about 😭 it' was a good concept and the idea was very well pitched, the cover and the blurb were solid, easy to lure anyone however there were some things that just did not work out but before we get into it, let's see what did work out;What I liked:• The first half was well done, I was hooked and I was intrigued and I wanted to binge it.•The mystery aspect and the back forth during the first half was really nice between the two povs and two settings.•The characters were fun to read about and the unsettling feelings that revolved around them + the overall vibe was fun.What I didn't like:• The pacing overall was very slow, despite being hooked during the first half it took me a fair amount of time to get through it and during the second half I lost it sm I even skimmed a bit.• Story started to lose itself in the second half everything got so messy with execution and the thing just lost their charm which overall dulled my experience.• The characters and their back and forth with the settings proved to be more of an hindrance. I tried to like Naomi and Maya but all the attachment that I felt to them and the story vanished into thin air.Overall, it may work for some of you but it definitely was not for me or atleast the second half was. I do believe that this author can do better and I may read more of her books in the future. It wasn't a bad book, it was just very messy.___I need a GOOD thriller/mystery book!!*Thank you to Penguin Random House for giving me an E-Arc for this book*","I'm hooked! The mystery surrounding the dark society of Greystone in Princeton, where devoted attendees vie for their futures through powerful connections, intertwines with the enigmatic drowning of a young student: Maya's sister Naomi,  who harbors a dark past within the same college. Maya, doing everything in her power to conceal a tragic incident related to the death of a student connected with one of the teachers, takes us on a thrilling journey.WOW! This might be one of the longest summaries I've written. My mind is about to be blown because I couldn't stop reading this thriller with so many layers, incredible characterization, and a balanced, paced trajectory that keeps your attention intact. The narrative transports you 13 years back, where young Maya, biracial with a Chinese mom and a black father, recently orphaned with her 8-year-old sister Naomi, finds herself part of a secret society surrounded by privileged students. Maya does what she can to adjust, providing extra funds to send her sister to school, even if it involves her into the pyramid scheme of the institution. We then move seven months before the present time, witnessing Naomi, Maya's little sister, unfortunately following the same footsteps, estranged from her sister and part of a secret society, entangled in a love triangle that may be doomed with heartache!We witness how Naomi's actions may resolve with her death as she attempts to uncover the mystery of a student's death under suspicious circumstances that was swept under the rug. When she discovers her straight, cold, career-oriented sister may be one of the last persons who has seen the dead girl alive, and the possibility that the girl has been silenced for knowing too much about the secret society connections, Naomi teams up with her roommate, an intern at the New York Times, to unravel the dirty secrets! Could her attempts to face the past be the reason for her demise? Or is she the victim of a love triangle that has gotten out of hand?Maya has to confront her dark past, face the consequences of her actions, and find out the truth about her sister's death, even though it may ruin her entire future and the family she's built.Overall: As soon as I started to read Naomi's narrative, I easily connected with her, and I wished there would be a miracle that she could be alive, that the entire mystery might consist of misunderstandings. Her story broke my heart. I also easily understood the reasoning behind Maya's actions. She's burdened with too much baggage at a young age and needed to find a way to survive, which may have led her to dangerous roads.I loved the realistic execution and depiction of the secret society. As I thought I finally pieced up another layer of the mystery, the author perfectly presented another layer, and I hardly guessed some parts of twists, which are perfectly executed. It's a one-sitting, intense read that also wrecked my heart with a realistic but sad conclusion. Especially the sisters' miscommunications that affected their entire relationship broke my heart. This is great reading that earned my five unputdownable stars I highly recommend.Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing/ Ballantine/ Bantam for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest feedback.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","“Did my silence allow the same thing to happen to my sister? “  Brief Summary-  Maya is supposed to be celebrating her little sister Naomi’s graduation from Princeton the same college she attended 10 year prior. But instead, Maya ends up investigating her sister death. As Maya keeps digging for the truth she realizes the secret society she was involved in when attending college might be the key to finding out who killed Naomi. This is a dark academia story with the rich acting unhinged. Told from the alternating viewpoints of Maya and Naomi, the reader is given two different time periods with each POV leading up to the murder.  My Thoughts- This book had a very intriguing plot. The characters were very well liked. The author does a great job with weaving in the dark campus vibe and the suspense to this story. The writing in this book was very detailed and vivid. I felt like I was standing on the room with each character. I love how this book touched on privilege and race and how it applies at an elite school like Princeton. Money and power is everything, am I right? I do have to complain about the pace. It was very slow. I think the reason I felt this way is because given the dual POV (which I love in books) it was very confusing, because of the repetition of characters and settings.  I had to stop reading to go back to the beginning of the chapter just to confirm who perspective it was. The POV were just way too similar to each other. There was a lot of miscommunication in this story between the sisters. 😭 Which I did not like. But overall, it was a fun ride. The story kept you guessing the whole time. I kept thinking I figured it out but in reality I kept coming up wrong. 🗣️I do recommend this book. This is my first book by the author and I can’t wait to check out her future work.  “The world does not make sense.

Don't Open Your Eyes,Liv Constantine,4.04,"Let me start with a plot summary before diving into my thoughts on this highly anticipated thriller:Meet Annabelle: a social media marketing specialist with a seemingly perfect life - a devoted doctor husband and two beautiful daughters. But her world turns upside down when she starts having dreams that feel like premonitions... and keep coming true. These dreams force her to question everything: her marriage, her life choices, a devastating loss from her past, and her own secrets. They also warn her that her husband is hiding something big, and that her elder daughter Scarlett might be in serious danger. Could her dreams be real warnings? Who is her daughter secretly chatting with? Is Scarlett falling victim to something more sinister than catfishing? Annabelle is about to find out the hard way.Now, here's the thing - when you review a favorite author's new book, people might think you can't be objective. And I'll admit, I struggled with this one. For most of the book, I felt disappointed by the slow pace. We mostly follow Annabelle's prophetic dreams, deal with her husband's frustratingly controlling behavior, and watch Scarlett flirt with a mysterious online guy named Ben. By the halfway point, I'd figured out the connection between Annabelle's past and present - it felt a bit too predictable. I even understood what the dreams really meant (not just as premonitions, but as subconscious warnings).I was ready to give it three stars and call it a day, but then the last quarter of the book kicked everything into high gear. Even though I'd guessed the major revelations, the action-packed finale delivered what I'd been waiting for since page one. The ending really saved it for me.For my love of the author, I'm rounding up my 3.5 stars to 4. While it's not my favorite of her books, it's still a solid popcorn thriller that keeps you turning pages. I'd recommend it to fellow fans and anyone looking for a quick, entertaining psychological thriller.Thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing/Ballantine/Bantam for the advance copy of this anticipated thriller in exchange for my honest review.medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter<","If dreams come true….From the outside, Annabelle seems to have it all.

Sunburned,Katherine Wood,4.16,"3.75 ⭐️ Sunburned was a scandalous read! I was immediately intrigued by the luxurious island setting and distinct premise. This was my first read by Katherine Wood. It was a slow burn thriller with the most unpleasant and deceitful characters, but their vile and appalling personalities fit this narrative perfectly. Sunburned was about betrayal, secrets, and the complexities of relationships. The story centered around Audrey Collet, who was drawn back into the life of her ex-boyfriend, Tyson, when he was blackmailed and faced a threat of exposure. Audrey wanted nothing more than to refuse his invitation. She reluctantly traveled to St Barths to help him figure out who in his entourage was extorting him which led her to confront her past and the secrets she and Tyson, along with others, had been holding onto.I always enjoy a solid locked room mystery and this was certainly one with a twist. I loved how Wood fabricated the most luxurious private island setting. A yacht in the South of France was an enticing backdrop for this unique narrative. I was instantly drawn to the lavish lifestyle captured from the very first page. The intricate descriptions set the tone and I felt as if I was there with the characters living their lifestyle and navigating the mystery along with them. In addition to the compelling plot and beautiful island setting, all of the characters were well drawn out. Even the least likable characters were interesting. Audrey, the main protagonist, was vulnerable and caring, yet a strong and driven woman. She was determined to help her ex find the person blackmailing him. While doing this, Audrey confronted the repercussions of her own choices and ended up discovering a deeper understanding of her own values and motivations.Along with the established plot and characters, Wood did a good job at exploring a variety of themes. This story took a close look at the betrayal and secrets of the characters both in the past and present day. More specifically, these themes examined the consequences of betraying trust and the lengths people go to keep secrets. This story also focused on the complexities of relationships and the complicated web of connections between people. Some of the characters revealed hidden truths about their pasts and highlighted the power of secrets and the potential for them to unravel theirs and others lives which led to devastating consequences. Despite all the positive aspects there were a few aspects that didn’t work well. First, there was a lot of dialogue. A bit too much for my taste, and with that, there were a few too many technology references in the first quarter of the book. Second, there were some coincidences that had me questioning its credibility, and lastly, there was a lot of repetition of the narrator expressing their emotions and concerns. Sometimes less is more, and in this instance, this could have been tidied up. All in all, Sunburned was a scandalous locked room mystery thriller. If you like stories about wealth, betrayal, secrets, and complex relationships, you will most likely be entertained by this one.Thank you to NetGalley, Ballantine Books and Random House for the e-arc in exchange for an honest review.",Thanks for the ARC NetGallery! I really enjoyed this book. Any mystery/suspense novel that keeps me guessing all throughout the book is a winner for me. I didn't even guess all the twists!,"This is one of those wonderfully-convoluted novels that had me guessing all the way through! Protagonist Audrey was on a scuba diving excursion 11 years ago when 5 of them went missing. In the present she's still consumed with the mysteries surrounding the past and how it has seemed to collide with events today. Lots of suspense as she begins to uncover events that no one else deemed important. Extortion, blackmail...what's not to love?Thanks to NetGalley for this ARC!"
The Housemaid,Freida McFadden,4.30,"Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖Thank you Bookouture and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing","1.5 ⭐️ Did we all read the same book?

My Thoughts:
What a fucking waste of my time. I am annoyed I read this book and cannot believe it came so highly recommended. There's so much I can say but I'll keep this review short since I don't want to spend more time thinking about this book than I have to. I hardly ever read thrillers yet I was able to predict everything. I honestly wish I DNF'd but I decided to keep going for the big plot twists that I was told would completely surprise me; but alas, they did not. The author basically tells you what's going to happen next by making the narrator have internal dialogue that panders to the reader. Here are a few examples. 1. The FMC, Millie, enters the room she will be living in and goes, ""There was something about that room that was very scary."" Oooooo, I bet something terrible happened there. *I say this sarcastically*2. Millie meets the gardener and she notices, ""There's something in his expression that sends a chill down my spine. And then he shakes his head, almost imperceptibly. Almost like he's trying to warn me."" And then he tells her it's dangerous and she should leave. Huh, I wonder why the gardener would tell a random woman she's in danger living in this rich suburban home as the maid. What could possibly go wrong?3. Millie meets the husband and immediately notices how hot he is. ""It's hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife."" And throughout the story she constantly comments on how handsome he is. I wonder what's going to happen between the super hot maid and her super hot employer. . . 4. Millie's bedroom door locks from the outside and she notices there are scratches on the door, ""Like somebody was scraping at the door. Trying to get out."" Cue the Cardi-B viral sound ""That's suspicious. That's weird."" We all know she's getting locked in that room at some point.There's a lot more but again, I don't want to spend more time on this book so, moving on to my next point. The writing was juvenile. Along with the author's penchant for pandering to the reader, the book was just so averagely written. It felt like someone in high school wrote it. Simple writing. Basic characters. Unrealistic development. Millie was an unbearable FMC. She's a recently released convict and has had a hard time keeping a job. She's desperate, which is why she overlooks all the red flags about this new job as a maid. But for fuck's sake, it's like she has zero self preservation. I absolutely hated her and the choices she made throughout the story. The only redeeming thing about her was how she handles everything at the end. But that ending has me laughing because of the sheer stupidity of it all. You're telling me Millie has been a dud for the entire book but somehow she comes out on top at the end? I don't believe it but whatever. Overall, this book was a miss and I do not recommend it. I should be giving this 1 stars because I legit didn’t like anything about it. But it was readable and even if predictable, there was a cohesive plot. . . so I’ll give it 1.5 stars.","“The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that’s also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden’s excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It’s a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you’ll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it’s a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don’t worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I’d consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I’m a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can’t tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn’t expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give “The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I’ve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It’s a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I’ve read by her and I’m genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!"
Never Lie,Freida McFadden,4.09,"Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖 I read this as part of a group buddy read on Instagram which is why I didn't yeet it into outer space.  One sentence review:  L M F A O you're joking  SYNOPSIS Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are snowed in during their viewing at the creepy, dusty, secluded mcmansion once owned by Dr. Adrienne Hale, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace four years ago. When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor's disappearance.  MY OPINION BUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE. Where to start, where to start? Ok let's do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here's an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:  But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere. I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere. Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here's a sample: I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him? The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming. Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won't reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:  I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.  Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they're gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.  SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM At first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan's BMW (it's not a car, it's a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she's okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman's RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty. Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she's shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn't one.Tricia's behaviour doesn't even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog's bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would've made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together. Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I'm going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I've read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest. Adding her to my avoid list lol. PROS AND CONS Pros: funny rants with the buddy readers, she did have some good red herrings in there tbh Cons: ... did I stutter? 😂___Check out my YouTube","4/5 ★’s⁀➷

°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°𝓼𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀i’ve never had so many trust issues in my life. freida…idk how you do it. i seriously want to crawl inside this woman’s head, but i fear i’d lose my mind within the first hour of living in there. freida is my go-to author when i want to get out of a reading slump because all of the books i read by her so far…i’ve read in less than 7 hours. once you start, you can’t stop. since it’s so hard to write a spoiler free review for a mystery/thriller, i’m going to keep it short and sweet🤭❥ 𝓂𝓎 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈:my rating for this book went from a 2.5 to a 4 star rating after reading the last 100 pages of the book. my only reasoning for the possible 2.5 rating was simply because i thought i knew everything going on. i thought i finally had freida’s mind figured out. i was so excited, but at the same time was bothered because i was thinking that if all my theories i had were right…then it was all pretty predictable. i seriously thought i ate and left no crumbs, turns out i was missing my mouth the entire time and left a complete mess😀❥ 𝓅𝓁𝑜𝓉: the plot was plotting…completely plotting against me. freida’s plots: 3. me: 0. why 3 you ask? because i read 3 of her books and freida made a fool out of me 3 times. the setting of the book was aaaaaaa so good!!! gave all the spooky vibes and i loved it. the best way to go into a mystery/thriller is completely blind, i promise it gives you the best experience. the plot twist…i would seriously like to know who saw that one coming because it sure as hell wasn’t me. the way my jaw dropped. freida really said fuck you and your theories and i was like okay slay. the only thing i can trust freida to do is write a good plot and i can’t wait to read the rest of her books. the more books of hers i read, the more i’ll have her like figured out…*nervously laughs* right?? freida if she read this: wrong bitch. ❥ 𝓌𝓇𝒾𝓉𝒾𝓃𝑔:the writing is so descriptive and i just can’t get enough of it. the chapters are short, the writing is really easy to read/follow, and her books are just overall really fast paced. you’ll be on page one, blink, and then all of a sudden you’re closing the book with your jaw on the floor. i always get chills while reading a freida book and that’s the power of a well written story.❥ 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓇𝒶𝒸𝓉𝑒𝓇𝓈:my main reason for not being able to give this book 5 stars. i just didn’t really have a connection to any of the characters…while the plot was amazing, the characters were just meh. there’s two in particular that i really couldn’t stand. it was just the things they’d do or say that had me like…please close your mouth and never open it again🙂i’m definitely comparing these characters to the one’s in the housemaid by freida. i has such a strong connection with the fmc, millie, and didn’t feel that kind of connection with any character here. °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°10/10 recommend reading this book if you’re a fan of mystery/thrillers that’ll have you wowed at the end. 
the only way two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead.
 ⤷okay pretty little liars, pop off💅🏼°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°❥03/05/24𝓅𝓇𝑒 𝓇𝑒𝓋𝒾𝑒𝓌:i told shei every single theory of mine and was wrong about every single one of them. THAT IS SO EMBARRASSING. i’m embarrassed. i thought i ate😔i finished this book in 4 hours and 29 minutes. i’m flabbergasted. rtc soon! ❥ 02/25/24my baby shei told me this was her favorite freida book and i trust her with my entire being🥹🫶🏼","What is with all these 4 star+ rated thrillers being so awful? I mean, I get that this book is quite compelling, especially with the use of short chapters and the psychiatrist's tape recordings to keep the pacing up... but, come on, go back and reread the first few chapters after finishing this book and tell me the twist makes sense. Because it really doesn't.So many people have recommended McFadden to me. I actually went and picked up this book and The Housemaid at the same time, but now I'm reluctant to start her other stuff because parts of this were laughably bad.It's hard to say which was the worst thing. The repetition of the same thing over and over?
It was a worrying reminder of the fact that I’ve only known my husband for a little over a year.It’s yet another reminder that I’ve only known this man for a little over a year.
The way the author hammered us over the head with a red herring to the point that I felt a little insulted?Tricia discovers tapes of sessions with ""EJ"", a psychopath and wine connoisseur with a ""familiar"" voice. Her husband is called Ethan, is a wine connoisseur, has a temper sometimes, has no known friends or family and, she notes, she doesn't know him very well at all 🙄Or the ludicrous twists that may have worked if this book had been written in third person, but in first person are utterly absurd?Also, the author does this weird thing where a character will say something via dialogue, then the narrator will make an extremely obvious observation about it in their inner monologue. For example:
“Don’t let him manipulate you,” Ethan says. “He isn’t a good person. He killed [spoiler]. He killed one of the people closest to him. What kind of person does that?”Ethan doesn’t have a clue that [spoiler] isn’t the one who killed [spoiler].
No shit! She does this multiple times.In some ways, two stars feels generous, but then I did blast through this with a need to know what the hell was going on. Not many authors manage to keep the suspense going like that."
The Boyfriend,Freida McFadden,4.03,"2.75!
I love Freida's books, not all of them are masterpieces but I enjoy them a lot, they get me out of my slump and have me hooked but this one was such a frustrating read. I feel like Freida writes really well she know show to grip the readers, draw them in and keep them over there. It's like you can't stop, you will sacrifice your sleep, your studies, your hobbies, everything just to know more and the 'One more chapter' feeling with her books is so real because it's always one more chapter until you are eventually done with the books and that is one of the things about the boyfriend that I liked. It had an attractive writing style but I think Freida always fumbles when it comes to her characters, Millie and Nina were borderline annoying but Sydney Shaw made them look so much better. this book followed two pov's one in past about Tom and one set in the present following Sydney. Sydney was the most obnoxious fmc ever written to this date, I have never met such a dumb character!! like Idk how she survived even a single page. Her throughout the whole book is basically just figuring out why she cant find a man and why she shouldn't be jealous of her friends love life and then it slowly transitions into meeting a hot guy being suspicious of him, morphing into being conflicted between two guys, which then finally turned into Sydney thinking that she ate but made the most dumbest decisions leading to the last few chapters. She's so self absorbed and she does not change one bit throughout the books,. She was literally like a cardboard piece and I feel like character development was found dead when it came to her.I feel like her character was not well fit for this story, she was so inconsistent!! She would want to find her bestie's murderer but also forgets about it the moment a hot guy does something that a human being does and it made me so furious but also I feel like it was simultaneously a good thing because Sydney was so dumb that if she took everything in her own hands I would have thrown my phone on the wall and would have bald spots because I could not bear one more chapter of her trying to figure out who the killer was. I wasn't this interested in her story.The past point of view is where I had most of my concentration, it follows the pov of Tom who's trying to get this girl Daisy to fall in love with her and I was pretty hooked when it came to that because it had raised stakes and had me questioning things which was totally absent in the present pov, It had a more mysterious nature which I was expecting throughout the whole book. I feel like this pov definitely made me doubt a lot of things and I feel like it serves its purpose well!! This part was the saving grace of the book. (which helped me not dnf it)While the past pov was more interesting the character wasnt really :/ why were they trying so hard to shady and psychotic, honestly it was so eye roll worthy, She tried to make them so weird and Tom half of the time was deciding whether slug was his friend or not lmao. I wasn't that frustrated with his character as much as I was with Sydney but it wasn't exactly the best either.The plot overall was fine and the plot twist was the only things that I did not predict I was shooketh when it came to that because the way the story was building up I had no idea that was happening it did a whole 180 on my theories. I would say the past pov was more stronger because it had me raising questions like How does it connect to the main story and wanting to kknow what happened next and Sydneys plot line made me want to throw this book in a dumpster. It was okay with a good plot twist. I would say the after the twist, I think three or four chapters were left and they were very underwhelming and diluted. It felt like an episode of You mixed with real housewives of beverly hills and very diluted and all the high that twist put us through quickly faded away. The prologue and the epilogue are things that she aces while the prologue was really good and wild the Epilogue was the most eye roll worthy epilogue of the century, I could have lived easily without having read that. Waste of pages, waste of trees.Overall, I love her books and i've enjoyed all of them, even this but her characters seem to be growing more erratic one book after the other but I know this wont stop me from reading more of her books, I'll be lined up whenever shes releasing her next book!___Well time to say goodbye to my sleep schedule. (So happy I got an audiobook because exams are killing me) ___I take a napmeanwhile Frieda Mcfadden:Here you go another book that would probably not let you sleep...","In the words of Forest Gump… STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES*pulls sleeves back, cracks knuckles* Ok lets go…Ms McFadden has come out with her fourth release of this year with The Boyfriend. In this book we are following dimwit Sydney who just wants to find Mr Right and settle down. She goes on a date with a guy she’s been speaking to on a dating website and realises she has been catfished when he turns out to be a creepy little sod. When said sod starts behaving aggressively towards Sydney she is rescued by a charming mystery man and thinks she has finally found her match. Is Sydney about to get her happily ever after!???.... 😒😒🙄🙄🙄Our main character Sydney is one of the most idiotic characters I have had to suffer reading through. The boys in Dumb and Dumber don’t even come close to just how stupid Sydney is. So because we are going through this story in her narrative, we have to ignore the obvious and go round and round in mundane circles. In Sydney’s eyes every Red Flag was frankly Beige!Sydney and co are all caricature characters. There is not a single character development, and we don’t get to know anything else about them than what we barely already know. I had to stomach through the first 50% of the book with Freida talking about the most pointless things such as: Flabby arms/ Sleeveless dresses, Sydney being a bleeder, women over 34 and their fertility and of course Turtles... etc…The book is told in dual POVs with Sydney and a guy named Tom. Tom’s storyline is told in the past when he was 16 years old. He has a crush on a girl named Daisy Driscoll, who he really wants to be with, but he also wants to squeeze the life out of her, because you know he has a fetish for harming people and seeing blood. Oh and he really hates his dad. I WONDER HOW THESE TWO POVS ARE CONNECTED… 😒😒😒Anyway, the story only really picks up after the 50% mark, but don’t get too excited because we still have deal with Sydney’s annoying ass and moronic inner thoughts. In true Freida fashion her mind games are activated, and I must admit that I did not see the “big” plot twist coming, but all the other ones were painfully obvious. Speaking of the major plot twist it is very, very, VERY dumb and of course with any Freida book suspension of disbelief is HIGHLY REQUIRED! The ending was so dense and dull, I had to fling my kindle, put myself in a corner and have a serious word with myself as to why I keep letting Freida do this to me. Then the epilogue… no words. Unfortunately, The Boyfriend is not a winner for me, but I will say it was more palatable than the Housemaid is Watching. My main issue is that nothing and no one’s actions made sense. Consequences and common sense was not a factor in this book. Extreme things would happen and then just be swept under the rug. Besides the ‘big twist’, the book was very mild and produced more eye rolls than I can possibly count. For a quick mindless read/ listen and to laugh at the brainlessness of a bunch of characters then you can give this book a go. Freida I will keep hoping and praying that we will get back to how we once were.I will see you in 2025 for The Crash 😭😭😭THE END. 2.5 ⭐------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩ITSSSSS TIIIIIIIIMEEEEEEE!🤩🤩The devil works hardBut Freida McFadden works harder! Fingers Crossed this one delivers!🤞🏾🤍❤️🤍","3.5 stars! This book was a fun mystery but my least fav Frieda McFadden book I've read so far. I liked that it had two timelines & the concept was really fun. Also the twist got me!!! I did not see it coming. Would've never guessed the ending in a million years. BUT for a good chunk of the book I felt like I was waiting for more things to happen. I wanted more clues, suspicious people, and creepy moments. Overall great if you're looking for a light easy read."
The Crash,Freida McFadden,3.72,"2.75!
Where the fuck do I even start-I was supposed to start it on the 28th but I scrolled insta all day 🧍🏻 and yesterday I actually had no hot to read this but l because I had so many assignments.... So by the time I got done ( 1 am) I picked this up and I literally finished it by 4:40 😭😭 like I read it so quick and I actually had no hopes of read it this quick but it was very easy to read. I think that's what I like about Freida McFaddens books they are very enjoyable and easy to read so like that automatically puts them on the three star region and the plot twist or how well she carries the whole plot determines whether it's 4/5 or 2 😭 and in this instance it was the latter. While I love the thrilling vibe (minimal, but still enticing) and the fast paced nature of this book, I could not overlook the factors that hindered my enjoyment level for this book.I don't know though to be honest, if the cause of this is Frieda working overtime when writing isn't even her full-time job, to publish four novels a year that is putting a strain in the quality of the books that she publishes but I fear, it's time for her to take a break because no matter what I rate a Freida book, I always manage to enjoy it. I've not read that many books by her- only 6 (including this one) and this and the one that was published before this were the only ones I rated two stars so the quality of her new books is definitely dropping. Her books are a guilty pleasure for me. You give me her books and I would enjoy them sm so I actually cannot give up on this author 😭✋🏻 but the plot twist in this one was the weakest and honestly it kind of made the plot look shallow.Enough yapping ✋🏻 time to get to the characters.Tegan, for a Freida McFadden FMC...she was actually decent loll. She didn't make me want to pull my hair out in frustration and she also had me hooked in her monologue like I was very invested and at first I thought the story revolving her would deal with her soon to be born babys daddy 😭 but boy was I wrong because the crash happened and everything switched and honestly I still didn't mind it. She was willing to fight and was actually smart (as compared to Frieda's other FMC'S 🙏🏻). I feel like Freida did a smart thing by making her injured so like she quite literally was bound otherwise I'm pretty sure considering the way this story went she would have annoyed the fuck out of me but I'm glad that didn't happen.Polly, I wanted to punch her. This bitch was crazy asf like pls no one wants them to this extent and honestly I wasn't really a fan of her perspective. She was very psychotic but her povs just made me agitated, I think that is what the author was going for so good job(?) but yeah I feel like seeing everything happening from tegans perspective proved to be more thrilling because we were unaware of the things happening and there was this sense of mystery but from Polly's perspective it was just frustration 😭 because we knew what was happening and we just couldn't help.Hank, :/ like???? At least he was better than the wife but honestly this couple made me never want to marry and I laughed so much because I remembered that meme- arranged marriage is scary, what if she.. and that fits so well 😭 but Hank was such a weird character. I liked seeing his morals play a role but the way things unraveled at the end all his morality thing going on felt so meh. I know this seems so messy because I'm trying to not spoil. Jackson and Simon(?), I actually thought that the storyline would follow them and I was actually invested but then the story switched and there scenes just vanished. I absolutely despise Simon. He's so baaaaad and Jacksons alright I literally have no thoughts for him because there wasn't any development regarding his character for me to form emotions or opinions on.SPOILERS GOING FURTHERwhat was even the point of the plot?? like first we are made to believe that Tegan's conflict would be with Simon the baby daddy but then it quickly switches to her being trapped in a batshit crazy woman's basement so the woman (polly) can find a way to get Tegan's unborn child and LIKE?? Why do you want a kid so bad- like okay yes kids are cute and good and obviously love them but to go to this extent- thats too much work. If I was living where she was living with a partner like Hank, i would wrap myself in a blanket, make a cup of hot cocoa and read a fucking book. Honestly, I was enjoying the plot and I was very invested to see where this would go and like how Tegan will get out because each day she was getting more crazy but the ending?? nah uh. The classic unpredictable frieda mcfadden plot twists were found dead here. It felt so predictable what was about to happen and like Polly coming to get that baby from Tegan WHILE SHE WAS IN A HOSPITAL but then thought yk what maybe later and went awayyy felt so meh and his brother being bad was just dropped out of nowhere. It felt so out of place and the whole hank killing sadies dad and adopting him..I saw it coming form a mile away but I thought that polly would do it instead of Hank but it was obvious when they found the police near her house that it was Hank and that for hank was very eh as well.Honestly the plot wasnt plotting in this one.SPOILERS ENDOverall, I just wish that the tenant is better.__Look this was very fun to read and I quote literally read it in one sitting but the ending was so shit 😭 RTC tbh because 🥴__Slept at the wrong hour 🧍🏻 now I'm gonna be awake the whole night sooo might as well just read a Freida book__Freida this is not good for your health 🙏🏻 sleep please.That being said, I'll absolutely eat it up!!","➳
2/5 stars
I’ve always been a fan of Frieda’s books, and I was so sure I’d love this one too, until I actually finished it. Honestly, this book felt like a repeat of The Boyfriend, her last release. I was beyond excited when I started it, but by the end, I was so disappointed. The entire story felt like a chaotic nightmare that led to a mediocre and predictable conclusion.The plot twist? Let’s just say it wasn’t hard to figure out, and it honestly had me rolling my eyes. I don’t mean to tell Frieda how to do her job like she has written some incredible books that are absolute bangers, and I’ve been her fan for a long time, but her last two releases have felt so unlike her usual work.Just like The Boyfriend, this book kept me on edge the whole time, only to deliver a twist that was way too easy to see coming. Even though the storylines are different, the predictable execution made them feel oddly similar. Frieda has so much talent, and I know she can do better! ➳

ABOUT THE BOOK — 

This book follows Tegan Warner, a 23-year-old woman who’s pregnant and traveling to meet her brother in another town. But fate has other plans, she gets into a car accident and crashes into a tree. Thankfully, she’s saved by a man named Hank, who takes her to his home. Sounds like the start of a rescue story, right? Well, not quite.Hank’s wife Polly, who happens to be a nurse, tends to Tegan but not in the way you’d expect. To say she keeps Tegan captive would be putting it lightly. Despite knowing the risks of not giving Teagan proper medical care, she couldn’t care less about her condition. But just when you think all hope is lost, the story takes a turn, and somehow, this wild ride wraps up with a happily-ever-after.➳

ABOUT THE CHARACTERS — 

Now, this might come as a surprise, but Tegan Warner  is the only FMC I’ve read in a thriller who actually had a functioning brain. Even after everything she went through, being in a car accident, being pregnant, and having a broken ankle, this girl fought tooth and nail to save herself and her unborn baby. Her determination was incredible. Sure, she made a few dumb decisions here and there, but they were easy to overlook because most of the time, she did what was best for both of them. What I loved most about her was that she never gave up, not even once. Her resilience made her the only tolerable character in the book, and honestly, I couldn’t help but root for her.As for the couple who  “saved” her...where do I even begin?  Hank  was essentially described as a human Bigfoot, massive, giant, and large. We get it, he’s huge, but did it need to be repeated every other paragraph? It was more annoying than anything else.And then there’s  Polly...oh, Polly. This woman was infuriating. The lengths she went to for her selfish desires were downright disturbing. I get that she suffered losses, and I sympathize with that, but let’s be real, dealing with grief doesn’t give you the right to make others suffer. Her actions were beyond cruel, and I hated her guts for it.➳

ABOUT THE WRITING— 

I’ve always loved Frieda’s writing, it’s simple, easy to read, and always manages to keep you hooked from start to finish. This book was no different in that sense. From the moment I started, I couldn’t put it down. Her storytelling has this undeniable grip, pulling you in with every chapter.But then came the plot twist, and...well, it left me disappointed. I had high expectations, especially knowing what Frieda is capable of, but this one just didn’t deliver the way I hoped it would. The twist felt underwhelming, which made the overall story lose some of its charm for me.That being said, there’s still something about Frieda’s books that I can’t resist. Even when the plot doesn’t hit the mark, the way she writes keeps you invested, turning the pages late into the night. That’s the magic of her stories, they reel you in and refuse to let go. For that, I’ll always be a fan.°˖➴ ""Overall, if you’re in the mood for a thriller that keeps you hooked from start to finish, this could be the perfect pick for you, especially if you’re already a fan of Frieda’s work!"" 💌— Thank you to NetGalley, the publisher and the author for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review.-ˋˏ✄┈┈┈┈୨ৎ  pre-read:⤿ started - december 27, 2024guess who got the arc of her most anticipated read of the year?! that’s right, me!! yayyy, i can’t stop screaming omgg 😩🤌🏻","i’m not even going to sugarcoat it — this book was horrendous❥ minus half a star for ‘Little Tuna’ 🥴❥ minus one star for the utterly stupid + delusional characters❥ minus half a star for the copious mentions of leg/ankle pain (we get it, you’re in pain!!!) ❥ minus one star for the terribly annoying + repetitive writing❥ minus half a star for being anticlimactic and very predictable (that ending was awful)so we’re at…. 1.5 stars! i am graciously rounding up like the nice human i am.

The Perfect Marriage,Jeneva Rose,3.98,"When I'm feeling a reading slump coming on, I usually pick up a nice fast-paced thriller to get me back into things. According to the reviews, The Perfect Marriage should have been that. All I can say is I guess it's true that it did make me want to read literally anything else.I don't get the hype. The writing isn't great, needs at least another round of editing, and there are plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. Everything is obvious, yet also verging on ridiculous, and people (mostly Adam) act absolutely moronic for no reason whatsoever.Everyone is awful, and not in an interesting way. Adam is the doucheiest misogynistic alpha male douchebag, not to mention a total dumbass, who seemed to do everything within his power to make himself look guilty. Sarah has to whisper ""bitch"" to herself whenever another woman in the room doesn't kiss her arse. The police investigation is laughable, so is the fact that they would charge Adam and send this to trial without accounting for several anomalies that showed up in the ""evidence"" (like someone else's DNA). Sarah, a lawyer, gets more facts on this case than the police have by simply having a conversation with the victim's colleague, which I guess the police neglected to do. And that attempt to explain away the shoddy investigation with the ""oh, it was the sheriff's DNA"" left me far more annoyed than satisfied. Way too convenient and it didn't make any sense.Also, was Kelly in an abusive relationship? Because I'm pretty sure that wasn't cleared up(?) I don't like when a character knows something is or isn't true because they see it in someone's eyes, or some other such nonsense, but then it turned out that maybe he was lying? Who even knows?So many other things I could whine about. The dialogue and the characters' actions all seemed so juvenile; not a single member of law enforcement or attorney behaved with a hint of professionalism-- all of them acted seedy, violent or just plain stupid. I got the sense that the author had no idea about criminal investigations or court proceedings. It is irritating when I put things together way before the characters do and have to watch them scratch their heads and think ""where have I seen this guy before?"" It is also irritating when characters act one way for the entire book then turn to the audience and mwahaha at the end.So much doesn't make sense. The outcome of this book is only reached by having everyone be stupid and do silly things for no reason.","What the hell did I just read? I hate this book. I loathe it. I want to burn it into ash. “Those are strong feelings” you might say to yourself. Well trust me when I tell you that this book is NOT WORTH IT. First of all, everything is so incredibly obvious, that the fact that they seriously titled it “a completely gripping psychological suspense” is so laughable. It was none of those things. It was sloppy and messy and the writing was so awkward that at times I found myself asking if I really just read the sentence that just came out of a persons mouth. And let me tell you something: I am so sick of these people writing about protagonists who talk as if they know nothing and then turn around and are the ones who committed the crime. YALL ARE NOT GONE GIRL. Gone Girl worked because Amy’s diaries were in the past. As soon as it switched to after, she was all “hahahaha I’m awesome I got away with it” all things she was thinking about THE WHOLE TIME. You can’t stick me with someone who acts surprised and upset and affronted when presented with evidence of murder when YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DID IT. Thoughts do not work that way. It is not possible to sit through an entire book of present-time thoughts and not once think about how great you are that you’ve pulled this off. I don’t buy it. It’s the worst trope out there, and it really just makes no god damn sense. Stop trying to pull one over on me and make it actually thrilling. And pro tip? If you want me to believe someone didnt do it, don’t make them say shit like “I’m the only one who can do this and you know why”. Yeah, I do. Because you’re the person!!! Ugh. This book was horrendous and I can’t believe I wasted so much time being even slightly intrigued by it. Do not do the same. Save yourself.","TPM was a book I wrote on nights and weekends while working a full-time day job as well as several freelance writing gigs.

The Housemaid Is Watching,Freida McFadden,3.88,"YASSSSSSS FREIDA give us absolutely…. NOTHING!My blood pressure was indeed high after this debacle! 😟The Housemaid is Watching starts in true Millie fashion with her being somewhere where her ass shouldn’t be and now she’s all in the mix up looking down at a deceased individual bloodied up on the floor. Ok Millie lets gooooooooo!… unfortunately all the Twists and Thrills shops must’ve been closed because this book went NOWHERE! It gave juvenile family domestic! Which would have been ok, but can you at least make it fun please??? I cant review this without giving spoilers, so don’t read ahead if you don’t want to be spoiled 😏 ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆So the book starts and I already know Freida likes to introduce us to a bunch of characters giving us a bit of their backstory and setting up a scene. That’s all well and good but this dragged on for at least 60% of the book. Like nothing interesting was happening. All we knew was Millie and Enzo bought a property without blinds. They have two neighbours who have their irritating flaws, are nosy AF, and one of them wants to get down and dirty with Enzo. Their son Nico is acting up all of a sudden breaking glass and slapping up classmates for no apparent reason. Millie cant stop talking about how obsessed she is with her new house that has left them broke and she has high blood pressure, and then the biggest upset of all is I’m pretty sure the Enzo in this book was a fraudulent clone, because the Enzo I know would NEVER behave as diabolical and egregious as he did in this book. WILL THE REAL MILLIE AND ENZO PLEASE STAND UPIn the last two books I’ve already accepted that Millie is very naïve with a kind heart, but is a BAD B when business needs to be taken care of. Its been over 11 years and personally with everything she has gone through I would expect her to be just a bit more wiser. Evidently that was not the route Freida chose to take and she decided to also include Enzo's fine ass to the madness and make these two the most moronic fictional parents of all time. Which parent in their right mind would give their young child a pocket knife to fight off bad people? What kind of husband would not confide in his wife what’s going on with the maid? Enzo this is LITERALLY your wife’s craft helping out abused women, but you want me to believe that her ‘high blood pressure’ had you keeping shtum and behaving like a shifty bellend!? GTFOH!Then Millie, I don’t even want to spend to long on you, but what a disappointment your character development really was. Your first thought being that your child could be a psychopath because they are acting out more than usually is BEWILDERING! FREIDA WHICH KIDS DO YOU KNOW THAT COMMUNICATE LIKE THESE 9 AND 11 YEAR OLDS? I know kids are growing up real fast in today’s world, but you can’t convince me they are speaking like Ada and Nico. Frankly both kids got on my last damn nerves, but I can’t blame them because they obviously have dimwits for parents. Oh and Freida you having an 11 year old tell another child that she will come into his room late at night and castrate him is REAL weird bro! What happened to kids reporting things that upset them to their teacher or parents? As for Suzette, Jonathan and Janice you lot can just go ahead and CHOKE! The reveal was underwhelming and unbelievable to say the least and having to trudge through how Millie was going to get Enzo out of prison was boring and predictable AF. Ada’s POV was eye-roll galore and did not a damn thing for me! The maid Martha can kiss my ass with that epilogue! Like was everyone just flipping mute and stupid in this book? You saw Millie who is someone you recognize, and you need her help, but instead of speaking out in the first chance you get alone time with her, You chose to behave like a creep staring her down like a loser, then start behaving mean and cold towards her when she rightly accuses you off being a thief!? THEN… Then you were comfortable to let Enzo take the fall for your crimes after everything he did to help you!?? Jesus take the wheel!!!!!!!!!!!This book was a MESS! The only redeeming factors was seeing young Cecilia Winchester all grown up and being a boss babe! The chapters were short which was cool, but this book was longer than it needed to be. It could have definitely been 100 pages less, but Freida chose to spend the book giving us unnecessary fillers (Why do we care that Millie’s lipstick came off her lips but it made no difference because they were the same colour as her lips???? Why do we care that Enzo is setting up the plates and forks on the dinner table??? Why do we care about your thoughts about a praying mantis???) and telling us every damn little thing like we don’t have common sense. FREIDA please I am begging you, leave the housemaid franchise alone now okay hun?? I need you to put the paper and pen down and go on a long hiatus! I know you got to be tired babes with all these back to back books, because frankly its now showing!! I miss the old Freida and this book was a massive flop! It wasn’t exciting at all and you made all your once loveable characters be idiotic fools. Sigh 🙄
“Were you completely shocked by who Martha really is, and by the Housemaids ultimate revenge? Did the twist and turns of Millie's and Enzo’s last adventure have you gripped?”
 FREIDA PISS OFFFFF! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣P.S. The Coworker turtle reference on page 25 was HELLA cringe…. OK I’M DONE, BYE NOW! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read ⋆｡°✩*mariah voice* It’s TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMEThe Queen of Mess, Thrills and Twisty Twists! Millie don’t disappoint me girl!!! 👀🤍","--Oh my goodness! Quick confession: I didn’t expect to love the third book so much, but it exceeded all my expectations! It's far better than the second book; I couldn’t put it down. I even canceled my appointment with my accountant, even though I have taxes to do. Who cares about taxes when there's such an amazing book to read? Okay, it's wrong to say something like that as a law-abiding, mature citizen, but come on, this book is incredibly good. I found myself wanting to stop time just to peacefully read my advance copy!What can I say to rest my case! The adventures of Millie the maid are the definition of addiction! I know I can find hundreds of people like me (maybe thousands) who, once they start one of her books, they cannot stop! It’s more addictive than Pringles! It’s riveting page-turners! It’s my favorite guilty pleasure!Her new adventure takes us 11 years later where we left things with Millie and Enzo. Now they’re older, married, having two kids; one A grader, sensitive, mature, smart daughter Ava, and a friendly, energetic, sporty 9-year-old Nico, named after Enzo’s family members. Their luck turned out, and their offer for the house has gotten approval which means they are about to be suburbanites, living in ( correction living ""ON"") Long Island.Millie is jumping in excitement to build a new life in a big house she still has questions about how they bought under its value even though they have to work harder to pay the mortgage. She is also excited to make new friends with her neighbors but unfortunately one of her neighbors cannot keep her hands off her husband, shamelessly flirting with him as the other woman who is health-obsessed and also a noisy busybody who likes to watch each step she takes from her house and make her uncomfortable. In addition to that, Enzo makes a jest to hire their neighbor’s maid Martha: the same woman she keeps giving her scrutinizing looks as if she knows her criminal dark past.Could Millie make the worst mistake by moving to this neighborhood where her neighbors act like she’s mud under their boot to scratch, her children keep acting like strangers and her husband might be too friendly with Suzette Lowell: their flirty neighbor next door? At the top of that somebody gets murdered as expected. Because where Millie goes, there should be murder, shouldn’t be? How will she save herself and her family without getting involved? What her family members keep hidden from her?Well: didn’t I say how much I loved this book that I should scream at the rooftops kind of! I'm about to give this book ten stars which highly deserved! Don’t forget to add this book to your reading list. Who am I kidding? Just order your copy and dive in blindfolded! Satisfaction guaranteed!Oh boy, I hope Freida McFadden keeps writing more Millie the Maid sequels to feed my cravings! I never get enough of this series!Many thanks to NetGalley and Poisoned Pen Press for sharing the digital reviewer copy of the most anticipated thriller of the year in exchange for my honest opinions which I truly appreciate!medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter","no spoilers just few thoughts. the title truly encapsulates the book because all Millie did was watch. if she had been less concerned about Enzo (he also has some fault here), she might’ve picked up on what was going on. So the naivety? It never left and that epilogue?? I had a feeling because who else was left, so I wasn’t exactly wowed. And yes millie, we get it, the kids look like Enzo. the first 30-40% for me was fairly slow until the last half picked up that I breezed through it and why this is 3 stars and not 2. All the mixed reviews are valid as this wasn’t too bad but didn’t quite deliver on it’s execution and I can only hope the series ends here ""I am scared of you, Millie Accardi."" And he should be. Should he? Millie acted similarly to Nina at some point but this version of her kinda paled in comparison to the first two books—even if years have passed. A smarter and less idle/oblivious Millie would’ve been appreciated ""The third in a series usually isn’t that great, so it’s not his fault."" i mean.. she said it lol -So Millie years later? Please tell me she’s done being naive lol"
The Inmate,Freida McFadden,4.02,"★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★","4.0 stars— Everytime I research top thrillers on Kindle Unlimited there are numerous books with thousands of great ratings for Freida McFadden. So, I decided to read her newest book, “The Inmate”, and I have to admit it wasn’t half bad. The book begins with Brooke Sullivan starting her new job as a nurse practitioner in a maximum security prison. It happens to be the same prison where the person who was convicted of attempting to kill her and who is also the father of her 10 year old son resides. The author does a great job of interweaving the new interactions with baby daddy, Shane, with the events that led to his conviction and incarceration. As the author introduces new characters, it becomes obvious very quickly the path the book is taking for final resolution. In fact, about 1/4 of the way in I felt confident I could guess the ending. However, to the author’s credit, I was wrong and enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns the author used to finish the story. Were there numerous obvious red herrings? Yes. Did the author use many of the obvious cliches in thriller books such as storms, no cell service, impassable roads etc? Yes again. However, much like some of the summer blockbuster movies I enjoyed over the years, if you don’t over analyze and just go where the author leads you, the book was entertaining. I know many of you might disagree and call this book fluff, but I believe some books (and movies) are fast paced and entertaining enough to be worth reading. I definitely will be back for more of Ms. McFadden’s intriguing books.",**3.5 Stars**Interesting read. The twists at the end just didn't have that impact it needed.
The Teacher,Freida McFadden,3.91,"I've enjoyed previous books by McFadden (Never Lie, The Inmate, The Locked Door) -- so, despite REALLY disliking several of her recent books (The Housemaid's Secret, The Coworker, Ward D) -- I still really wanted to read THE TEACHER. This one felt more like her earlier books in a way I enjoyed -- mainly that it was super fast-paced and full of characters to dislike, so despite some serious misgivings along the way, I still had it clicking along at a pleasantly-surprising two or three stars in my head, but then the epilogue happened. I always expect a McTwist or twelve, and of course won't write a spoiler here (( BUT FEEL FREE TO SCROLL DOWN IF YOU WANT THEM )), but that last ""twist"" was completely fucking unacceptable on many levels.* thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for the NetGalley review copy.

Who is digging? Who is dead? Fun start! Then we flash back to three months earlier where we meet Eve Bennett, who is putting on a pair of black JIMMY CHOO stiletto pumps to go to her job teaching high school math (lol) and thinking about how hot her husband Nate is compared to her... and also how much she hates him because they never fuck anymore. Nate also teaches at the high school - English - and is the hottest hottie hot hot teacher at the school, based on a list made by the senior girls that another faculty member knew about and then shared with Eve? The next chapter is from Addie's perspective. She's a junior, and everyone at school hates her because last year there were rumors she had a relationship with her math teacher, Arthur Tuttle (who is decidedly NOT a hottie hot hot teacher as he evidently resembles Santa?), while he was tutoring her and ""ruined his life"". Eve doesn't like Addie because Arthur is the nicest man ever and could *never* do such a terrible thing. Because that's 100% how the world works. Men who seem nice could never, ever be predators. Duh. Addie gets bullied a bunch by a girl named Kenzie Montgomery - a popular cheerleader who is also (supposedly, but as it turns out way later is NOT) dating Addie's old BFF, Hudson Jankowski. Hudson was Addie's only friend for years - they both had drunk dads and not much money - but then Hudson got swole and started playing football and is now super popular.Anyway, Eve is PISSED because Addie the Santa Destroyer is in her math class and she's going to have to teach her even though she has a ""terrible feeling about this girl."" She drowns her sorrows by going to a shoe store at the mall and thinking about stealing some LOUBOUTINS because it wouldn't be a FMcF book without the word LOUBOUTINS in it at least once, but then she doesn't steal the LOUBOUTINS and goes home and tries to bone Hot Nate, but he's not into it, so they eat some pasta instead. Everyone in this book eats A LOT of pasta.Addie hates math and is not happy to be in mean Eve's class, but she's super jazzed because she's also in Hot Nate's English class and Hot Nate loves poetry and Addie writes poetry and he also writes poetry and he loves Edgar Allan Poe and she also loves Edgar Allan Poe and OMG!!!!!!!!! Addie writes a poem and Hot Nate LOVES it and wants to see her after class because her poem is so amazing and a lyrical masterpiece and should be published. He recruits her for the high school poetry magazine (called REFLECTIONS, dear lord), and he makes a lot of eye contact with his chocolate-bar-brown eyes. Later that day, Eve puts on her MANOLO BLAHNIK boots and ditches Hot Nate to go to a shoe store. It is very important to know that Eve really, REALLY likes shoes. Like so much. She tries on the same LOUBOUTINS she tried on at the mall and then Jay the hot shoe salesman feels her up and they go fuck in the storeroom among the piles of shoes. As it turns out, our girl Eve has been making love (vomit) with the shoe salesman once a week for the past four months and wishes she could run away with him. Oh, Eve. Addie and Hot Nate are at a Reflections meeting and he tells her he's entering her poem in a state competition because she is ""a master of this craft, even at sixteen"" and is so amazing. Addie says she's not amazing at math and Hot Nate asks if his wife is giving Addie a hard time and then says a bunch of shit about how he was dumb at math too and his wife is too logical and not a dreamer like they are... and now Addie is officially being groomed! Then it's Eve's thirtieth birthday and she puts on her LOUIS VUITTON pumps and tries to bone Hot Nate before work, but he's not into it again. Uh oh. Later that night they go out to dinner at a (yep) pasta restaurant and have a terrible time. Nate parks really far away from the entrance to the restaurant which is a dick move because she's still wearing those LOUIS VUITTON pumps with a four-inch heel. Eve thinks she should try to connect more with Hot Nate and let him read his poems to her in a park again like he used to (all I can think about are the Kens playing guitar at the Barbies for four hours on the beach), even though she doesn't even like poetry and would rather do quadratic equations because she likes MATH, goddammit. Hot Nate gets flirted with by the waitress and then spots Addie at the restaurant and talks about Addie's lyrical mind and their mutual love of Edgar Allan Poe a bunch to his wife. Happy B-day, Eve! Addie notices Hot Nate is eating ravioli and ponders his filling selection and wishes she was eating dinner with him so he could share his thoughts about EAP poems with her (again with the Kens on the beach). Addie and Hot Nate run into each other by the pasta restaurant bathroom (sex-ay!) and she worries that someone will see them talking and he'll end up ruined like Santa Tuttle. She tells him about her terrible day being bullied, so he gives her a special homework assignment to write an angry revenge letter to her bully and Addie thinks about what a bitch Eve is for making Hot Nate so unhappy. After the terrible birthday meal, Eve finds a pair of glossy red SAM EDELMAN sling pumps on her porch from Jay. Awww. Sex shoes!Addie's locker gets filled with shaving cream by mean Kenzie, and during the cleanup -- in the first McTwist -- reveals that Hudson helped her kill her father. DUN DUN DUNNNNN! Her dad was a drunk, abusive asshole and they pushed him down the stairs and pretended they were at Hudson's house studying the whole time. After the murder Hudson completely stopped talking to her, but he still helps her clean her locker because he is such a nice guy.Then Hot Nate comes along and helps clean up the last bit of locker shaving cream and offers Addie a ride home from school in his Honda Accord. Addie is digging the ride because the car is cleaner than her mom's and smells like him, and he tells her about the difficulty he experienced being a poetry-writing sixteen-year-old boy and recites the first poem he ever wrote (for his mom, at age six, which Jesus H DOES NOT COUNT AS A POEM), and she wishes they would kiss and thinks ""there's something poetic about the name Nathaniel"" (aaaand I am officially dead because my husband is named Nathaniel and I can't stop laughing even though this entire situation is gross AF). ANYWAY, Eve fucks Jay again. Addie cheats on a math midterm and gets busted. Eve wears her MANOLO BLAHNIKS to school. Hot Nate takes Eve to the bone zone after school so she doesn't rat Addie out to the principal for cheating on the math test. Addie steals Kenzie's keys, lets herself into her house, and breaks a ceramic bird. We are now 47% through this goddamn book.Hot Nate and Addie talk again after a Reflections meeting, and he lets her know that he got her out of trouble with his mean wife. Addie hugs Hot Nate to say thank you, ""But then something firm pokes me in the leg. Like a roll of toilet paper."" Um. I have read more than my fair share of sex business in books and have never in my life heard a boner compared to a roll of toilet paper. I have a lot of questions. Hot Nate apologizes to Addie for the toilet roll in his pants and then immediately launches into complaining about how his wife sucks and how he feels like he's finally connected to someone for the first time in his life. Addie leaves but can't stop thinking about that firm toilet paper pants roll (GIRL, RUN!) and comes back. Hot Nate says he's trying so hard to resist her but he just can't and then they go into the abandoned photography darkroom and make out a bunch. Hot Nate drives Addie home afterwards and tells her she's his soulmate. Then he goes home and tries to bone zone Eve but she turns him down, so now his toilet roll is blue and he is mad.Addie writes a terrible poem about her love for Hot Nate. Then Hot Nate reads her a terrible poem that he wrote. And now I can no longer call him Hot Nate as a joke because he's officially a fucking rapist.Addie and Sexual Predator Nate have a lot of predatory sex in the darkroom. SP Nate continues with the soulmate talk to keep Addie hooked even though ""it doesn't last long, and Nathaniel says that's normal when you like somebody as much as he likes me."" AAAAAAAGH. Addie starts thinking about how much better everything would be if Eve was not around anymore.Then Addie gets her lunch dumped on the ground by Kenzie and Kenzie sees a copy of the poem SP Nate wrote. Eve is mean and won't let Addie eat a sandwich during class, so Addie hates her even more. Eve and SP Nate have a bad dinner party with their friends. Eve spots Addie lurking in the bushes outside of their house and tells SP Nate about it. Eve then tells the principal and Addie gets hauled into the office. SP Nate tells her to ""deny everything"" so she lies and says she wasn't there, but since she also got busted lurking outside of Santa Tuttle's house no one believes her. SP Nate starts ghosting Addie so she goes to see him in his classroom during lunch. They kiss AND EVE SEES THEM and takes a picture. This is the part of the book where Eve talks a bunch about how none of this is Addie's fault and that she is a child and that SP Nate is a fucking creep who took advantage of her vulnerability and that it was his responsibility to keep this from happening because he is an adult. Then goes on to say the age of consent is sixteen, so he's technically NOT a rapist. Keep all of this in mind when we get to the fucking epilogue.Eve then meets up with her fuckboy shoe salesman Jay and tells him everything. They decide she needs to leave Nate and also decide not to tell the principal. Then Eve gets wasted, confronts Nate, and kicks him out. He yells at her a bunch about shoes and leaves. He texts Addie and says he wishes Eve was dead. Addie concurs and eats a bunch of ice cream. Eve also eats a bunch of ice cream and passes out on the couch. She wakes up to a loud crash and worries someone is breaking in to steal her LOUBOUTINS because that is rational and because LOUBOUTINS haven't been mentioned for a few chapters.omfg we're almost at the end. buckle up.The crashing sound was Addie knocking a frying pan off of the stove. Eve and Addie confront each other and Eve says a bunch of reasonable things about SP Nate being a manipulative predator and how his feelings for a teenager are not normal and Addie flips the fuck out and hits Eve in the head with the frying pan. Three times. She calls SP Nate using Eve's phone and SP Nate comes over. Eve wakes up while Addie is getting a sheet to wrap her corpse in and SP Nate strangles her. Addie notices that Eve's body is in a different location and now she has big finger-shaped bruises on her neck, but SP Nate convinces her to help put Eve's body in the trunk and they drive her body to an abandoned pumpkin patch. We learn that SP Nate's biggest fears are death and snakes. They start digging a hole, but then SP Nate lies about getting Eve's purse from the car and abandons Addie and goes home to bed. Addie finishes burying Eve and messages Hudson to come pick her up from the middle of nowhere. Now SP Nate is at home and weird shit keeps happening. He finds shoes in the shower and thinks about The Raven a bunch and eventually calls the police to report Eve missing. He then finds more shoes in strange places - some covered in dirt, some with smashed pumpkin on them, and then there's a bird in his kitchen so he thinks about The Raven some more. FFS. The police visit Addie and question her a little and seem to think she killed Eve because SP Nate shows them her rage letter about Kenzie. Then Kenzie shows up at Addie's house and apologizes for being such a huge bitch and tells Addie SHE was in a relationship with SP Nate when she was FOURTEEN and knows Addie is also being abused because SP Nate gave them both the same shitty poem (which she saw in the lunchroom) and they had to break up when Addie had her Santa Tuttle scandal so that's why she hates Addie so much. The girls then go to the police station and tell them everything - and the police actually believe them, which feels like a fucking miracle.SP Nate is home and finds a pumpkin with a bird inside in his kitchen and freaks out because THE RAVEN. The police are on their way so he goes to the pumpkin patch to check Eve’s grave and make sure she's really dead. Uh-oh... The grave is empty! Eve is alive! Turns out she unburied herself and called Jay to come get her. Jay takes her to the sexy shoe store and gives her some sensible winter non-fuck boots and hides her in his tool shed for a few days. They start pranking SP Nate with the shoes and pumpkins and birds and whatnot and when he goes to the grave they are waiting and hit him with a rock and chuck him in the hole and bury him alive. While digging, Eve remembers the poem SP Nate wrote her when she was fifteen and he was her teacher - and (McTwist!) it’s the same poem he gave Addie and Kenzie so I guess we’re all happy SP Nate is going to be dead in the pumpkin patch because he's a Serial SP with an unstoppable toilet roll. Now we’re (FINALLY) in the epilogue. The police stop investigating because Eve isn’t actually dead and they assume SP Nate just left town without a trace. Eve quits her job and also moves away. Hudson and Addie are friends again and Kenzie has stopped bullying Addie and no one is being sexually abused anymore, so I guess everyone is fine?And now for the final McTwist: IT TURNS OUT HUDSON JANKOWSKI IS THE JAY EVE WAS FUCKING IN THE SHOE STORE so she’s also a sexual predator despite her earlier CORRECT yelling at SP Nate about it being wrong to - you know - have sex with minors. For fuck’s sake. Also - from a strictly logistical standpoint… how did Hudson/Jay manage to drive to the middle of nowhere and back twice in one night to pick up both Addie and Eve? And why is he hanging out with Addie even though she tried to kill Eve? And he already knows she killed her dad? And how did he and Eve catch all of the birds? And get one to stay in a pumpkin? The end.EDITED 2/22/24 TO ADD/CLARIFY : Jay was not married. The baby was his little brother. The ""her""/woman on the phone was Jay/Hudson's mom. And according to FMcF herself... (thanks to a commenter asking FMcF directly) -- EVE KNEW JAY/HUDSON WAS A STUDENT AT HER SCHOOL. Aaaaaaaaaagh barf blech ewwww fuuuuuuck.","https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHWz-Q...Here’s my dance reading experience! Oh my goodness! The moment I lay eyes on any Freida McFadden book, I find myself canceling everything in my life. Even in the midst of preparing Christmas dinner, with invited friends and a few accidental crisps due to my divided attention—I just can't resist diving into more chapters.Her latest book should be promoted as the literary equivalent of Pringles: once you pop open the book, there's no stopping!""Teacher"" may have its faults, like plot holes, far-fetched twists, and characters you'd rather punch, curse, and scream at than care about, especially when bad things happen to them. Yet, it's undeniably addictive, with an extra-fast pace that keeps you entertained. I caught myself nervously laughing at the end of chapters, and thankfully, the final twist was a masterpiece. No one could see that coming, not even those with strong spidey senses and detective skills like me, who typically ruin surprises by revealing the killer in the middle of movies. I must applaud Freida McFadden; that amazing conclusion had me singing Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do""!Now, let's delve into the main story, centered around three highly antipathetic characters: Eve, a math teacher happily married to the very handsome and older Nathaniel, an English teacher at Caseman High School. People give Eve side-eyes, assuming she's too lucky to have lured a man like Nate with her mediocre looks. However, behind closed doors, nothing is as it seems. Her husband touches her monthly as a mandatory activity, and they grow estranged each day, fueling her obsession to buy more expensive shoes and hoard them in secret places around the house.It appears everyone is enchanted by her husband's charm. But when a problematic student named Addie is assigned to both her and her husband's class, Eve realizes she needs to be cautious. Addie is the reason one of her favorite teachers resigned due to inappropriate behaviors. Did the teacher truly touch that girl, or was she the stalker ruining the man's life? What if Addie sets her eyes on her husband? What if things spiral out of control?I'll stop here to avoid spoiling your reading experience. Despite its shortcomings, I had an amazing, highly entertaining time with this thriller. Especially in the second half, things get so batshit crazy that you keep telling yourself, ""no way,"" but yes way—it's a ride of expecting the unexpected! I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars to a solid 4; it's unputdownable, twisty, and well-executed.I eagerly look forward to reading the next addictive book by the author, including the third book of Millie the Housemaid.Many thanks to NetGalley and Poisoned Pen Press/Sourcebooks for sharing this wonderful book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","Just wait a moment. I have to go and be sick before I’m able to write. Back again, still nauseous but maybe I’ll feel better after processing what I’ve just read. Several times I wanted to quit reading and throw the book away, but I soldiered on, curious about what crazy twist McFadden would magically produce from her disintegrating hat. To get there however, I had to torture myself with juvenile behavior, ‘don’t go into the cellar where the serial-killer is’ moments and despicable behavior. I know many fans out there are will feel enraged and profess their undying adoration for this amazing book, but so be it. I couldn’t stomach it at all. And by the way, the twist was not worth it. Especially if you don’t like far-fetched ones that give you a headache."
None of This Is True,Lisa Jewell,4.09,"I’m speechless after reading this bone chilling, dark, twisty, mind bending thriller which is one of the best works of Lisa Jewel.After reading a few pages, you find yourself drawn into riveting psychological thriller with unreliable characters, shocking revelations in podcast meets documentary blending in narration of incidents by hours and dates.

It’s like listening to a concerto slowly raises its tempo and as you reach the ending, you hear the crescendo: that’s moment the earth shattering revelation squeezes your heart, you barely breathe!  I have so many words for the ending that are not enough to express my feelings.

I want to start by saying: this was absolutely riveting. I inhaled this book. The only way the pages could have turned faster is if I had more hours in my day.The reason I am not giving None of This Is True five stars, which I thought I would for 95% of the book, is that I feel conflicted about the ending. Maybe it is because I have certain expectations from Jewell at this point, and the ending here didn't fit with them... I just know that I wanted more from the final chapters. In a way, it felt unfinished. Could there be a sequel lined up?But back to me gushing about the stuff I loved because this is a cracktastic ride.Jewell throws together two women-- birthday twins, born on the same day in the same hospital -- from very different backgrounds. Alix Summer, with her seemingly perfect life as a podcaster and her seemingly perfect family in their beautiful house, and Josie, a woman from a council estate with a past filled with abuse, grooming and who-knows-what other horrors.When Josie proposes she be a guest on Alix's podcast to tell the story of her life, Alix is curious about this strange woman. Josie lets Alix into her life and history through the podcast and Alix, in turn, gradually lets Josie into her life too. But the more Alix comes to know Josie and her past, the more she worries she's made a terrible mistake.Lots of short, punchy chapters, interspersed with a Netflix documentary and podcast extracts, all make for a very fast-paced read. You know bad shit has happened from the start, maybe reeeaaaaalllly bad shit, but I didn't have a clue what, exactly, had gone down, and I was desperate to find out. Alix's life is nowhere near as shiny as it appears on the surface and Josie is just a fascinating character. Peeling apart the layers of her backstory, discovering her childhood, her role as a mother, and the lies she has told, was pure heart-pounding fun!The wait for Jewell's next book will be too long.","None of This is True couldn’t be more apt for the title.Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, is out celebrating her forty-fifth birthday when she meets her birthday twin Josie Fair. She doesn’t think much more about it until she runs into Josie again outside her children’s school. One thing leads to another, and Josie convinces Alix they should make a podcast about Josie’s life, sharing her truth and making some big changes. Alix believes Josie has a compelling story to tell, even if she finds her unsettling and a bit intense. Things escalate quickly, and the two women’s lives become inextricably tied. If this book didn’t victim blame a thirteen-year-old girl, it would have been a four-star read. A teen is incapable (and inculpable) of holding any power over a creepy middle-aged man. I was engrossed in this story until Walter’s crimes were glossed over. It seems his repeated pedophilia was excusable because he was supposedly a good father. Can a pedo even be a good father? It doesn’t add up. Until this point, I found the story utterly compelling. I could feel Alix’s anxieties and Josie’s oppressive presence, but it all went downhill from there. The more I think about it, the worse it gets."
Listen for the Lie,Amy Tintera,4.09,"My hands and eyes were glued to the pages as this brilliant, twisty dark comedy-meets-murder mystery captured my entire nerdy gray cells from the very beginning. Lucy Chase, a blunt, smart, and straightforward anti-heroine, is a complex character that you can't help but root for, even though there's a chance she may be a cold-blooded friend murderer.The plot revolves around Lucy Chase, a widow and presumed killer who got away with the murder of her best friend, Savannah, the town's sweetest girl. Starting over in LA to build a new life, Lucy finds herself stuck in a meaningless job and a boring relationship with Nathan, who lacks the courage to end things with her. Her only solace is publishing romances under a pen name, but it's not enough to escape the traumatic effects of a brutal incident that occurred five years ago. The same incident took Savannah's life and left Lucy with brain trauma, resulting in temporary amnesia and blackouts.Enter Ben Owens, a smug and good-looking podcaster who starts delving into the murder mystery of Savannah, stirring up a storm that threatens to unravel the new life Lucy has painstakingly built. Her lovely grandmother, the only person who believes in her innocence, invites Lucy to her birthday party, further tempting her to return to her hometown of Plumpton, Texas, where the townies have already labeled her a killer, including her self-righteous, difficult parents. Ben Owens' arrival in town at the same time to interview anyone who thinks she's guilty adds fuel to the fire. But Lucy already has enough on her plate, with voices in her head screaming ""Kill!"" and the ghost she keeps seeing everywhere. Her increasing ability to visualize creative ways to kill those who anger her becomes another side effect that hinders her pursuit of a happy life.Despite the risks, Lucy decides to face the truth and confront the smug podcaster by returning to her hometown, even if it means potentially ending up behind bars. Is Savannah truly the sweetest girl in town, as everyone claims, or does she also harbor dangerous secrets? What if the entire town is hiding skeletons in their closets, secrets that may be worse than Lucy's actions? And the most crucial question of all: Did Lucy really kill her friend, or is she another victim unjustly crucified by everyone?The smart, sarcastic tone, perfect characterization of the heroine, and portrayal of flawed, biased townies, combined with the riveting pacing and a twisty, dark, yet fair conclusion, made me adore this book. It deserves a well-deserved five stars, and I would even add an additional star for Grandma Beverly, the wittiest, most colorful, and adorable character in the book. I wished to be adopted by her!This is undeniably one of the best novels I have wholeheartedly enjoyed, and I highly recommend it to anyone addicted to great dark comedy and riveting thrillers. I eagerly look forward to reading more works by Amy Tintera!I extend my sincere thanks to NetGalley and Henry Holt & Company for providing me with a digital reviewer copy of this amazing book in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter","Eek! Did I just cheer out loud?!Five years ago, Lucy Chase was found staggering along a highway with a welt on her forehead, make-up running down her face, and her best friend’s blood all over her dress. So, how did she go from “fellow victim” to the only suspect in Savannah’s murder?Lucy claims that she cannot remember what happened that night, but everyone in the small town of Plumpton, TX thinks that she is lying ( including her own parents) despite the fact that there isn’t enough evidence to convict her.And, that has convinced her that maybe it’s true, and she did kill her.Once sufficiently recovered from her physical injuries, she moved to Los Angeles and she now writes romance books under a pseudonym, because “nobody would want to read them if they knew she was a suspected killer.” L.A. seems like the perfect place to be anonymous for a girl who continually makes poor decisions, and keeps hearing her friend Savvy’s voice in her head saying “LET’S KILL”!But, you can’t hide forever.Ben Owens has just decided to make Lucy Chase the subject of the second season of his popular podcast, “LISTEN FOR THE LIE” .So when Lucy’s (scene stealing) grandmother Beverly calls insisting that she come home for her 80th birthday celebration, she can’t say no-especially her beloved Grandma is the only one who ever believed in her innocence. It doesn’t hurt that the announcement of the Podcast just cost her, her “day job” and her “boyfriend” who suggested that she not return after her visit to Texas. She may as well return home to see what the podcaster digs up.But, “What If The Truth Doesn’t Matter?”The story unfolds mainly from the the first person POV of Lucy and she is a hot mess! But, IF you appreciate SARCASM, SNARK, and DARK HUMOR like I do, you will LOVE her! I laughed out loud several times, and that rarely happens when I read a book.Her chapters occasionally alternate with the “Podcast interviews” so the residents of Plumpton can “shed light” on the crime “as they know it”. And, in this book, the podcast chapters work well and are an integral part of the narrative.The pace is FAST, with never a dull moment, as tempers flare and hormones rage-yes, the men and women of this town love secrets, sparring and sex in equal measure!SO MUCH FUN!And, what had me cheering out loud at 95%? (No peeking!)🫣 Just one of my favorite scenes EVER in a mystery/suspense book! Can you guess which scene it was? AVAILABLE now!! Thank You to the Publisher and NetGalley for the gifted copy. It was my pleasure to share a candid review!","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
Verity,Colleen Hoover,4.30,"2.5 stars?This was straight-up hilarious. The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that people cried while reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑 So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman, this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is. Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don't even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue. She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn't concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in. Oh but she's so evil😢, oh but she's so callous🙄, she's just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time. Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes: 💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean like literally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I'd be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me. 

I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.

How I imagined Verity every time she'd unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.

my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast. My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy. Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.

Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I was half fully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav. I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn't creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie. 

He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.

And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I've ever read. EVER. In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you'd expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We're not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn't care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power. EDIT 08.2022: 8 months later and I've decided we're gonna talk about the ending. Here's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I'm gonna choose the letter. As we've already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn't any better. Personally being impressed with the author's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist... WOULD BE if this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn't, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one. all in all: I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that's about it.EDIT 10.2022: I've read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍","NOTE: This review is based on my personal opinions about this book. Please note, this is in no way an attack to the author. I am not an advocate of hate trains, lets not send hate to anyone. Full Review: Maybe I should stop reading Colleen Hoover, maybe its not these books and it's me. Anyhow, I am thinking the reason I keep coming back is because, her plots are very interesting and the execution always falls flat. OK...where do I even begin with this mess?The story was captivating, probably the best plot I've seen in Colleen Hoover books so far. Everything else sucked. The characters were shallow and convoluted, I tried my best to relate to Lowen, but I disliked her just as much as I dislike Colleen Hoover's other main characters. They all have similar personalities and nothing to offer. Maybe because they sound so righteous but are wrong is many places. All the characters she writes are cookie cutter adult contemporary heroines, wrapped in tragedies and trying to get through life. There is no distinct 'voice' in Hoover's characters and it's a shame because with the plots she sets, the characterization can do better. You know how some things only feel good in theory? But in practicality, they make no sense? That's how CH writes. Speaking of characters, Jeremy was nothing special either. He didn't play much of a role in the book, at least not actively. He was there to serve Verity's storyline and being the love interest. And that's that. He has a personality of a dry leaf and why both Verity and Lowen were obsessed with him...is a question for another day. Jeremy is not enigmatic, he is not mysterious, he is not anything and that's one of my biggest problems in the book. He is just so badly written, when there could have been soooo much Hoover could have done with his character. Why should I care about him?The fact that both main characters thought it was OK to cheat when Jeremy's wife was camatose in the SAME house made things worse. And they constantly try to justify this. Now I know that it was intended and everything but the fact that they showed little to no remorse was enough to make me hate both of them. The book itself does not acknowledge their cheating, there is no retribution, no consequence of their actions - everything is brushed off without thought. When a book has problematic aspects, it's perfectly okay. When these aspects are romanticized and their flaws are not pointed out (as it should be), then we have a problem. With Lowen and Jeremy not acknowledging the fact they cheated, it just sends a wrong message. Verity is supposed to be a psychotic and obsessive wife to Jeremy who had hated her children even before they were born. Again, sounds better in theory. The plotline should give you chills but ends up being cartoonish and cringey. Jeremy being a cement wall with no personality, her obsession made little sense. Still, she is a better 'character' than the other two. CH tried to write a dark character, but honestly with the wattpad-esque writing, there was no impact. I am glad that the author tried something different, and her writing has changed since her first books but that wasn't enough to cover up the bigger holes here. I have already talked about the characters, which were my biggest issue, specially because I prefer good characterisation over good plot. Here are a list of other reasons why Verity sucks. 1. It's not an erotica so why were there pages upon pages of repetitive sex scenes? In fact Verity and Jeremy's entire story was just that. It annoyed me because they clouded the story the whole time. The book was 10% story and 90% sex scenes. The publisher should market it as an erotica if that's the case??? Why is this a problem for me? Missed opportunity. Using sex as a tool to fill Verity and Jeremy's storyline is lazy writing, when those scenes could have been used to give Jeremy more personality and explore other aspects of their relationships. 2. CH might be a bestseller, but she is TERRIBLE at writing tragedy and trauma. Both are needlessly used as characters back stories and important part of their personalities but treated dismissively. The MC mom died of cancer a month ago and while it's talked about in first two chapters or so, it's forgotten quickly and Lowen in too horny to remember her. The man who died in front of her? No follow up on that trauma, nothing at all. It just served as a way for her to meet Jeremy. Hoover takes these heavy plot points to add drama, but she never treats them well enough. You do not need to shove one traumatic event in vain to add substance. A well-rounded protagonist can be formed without relying on trauma at all. If the purpose was for us to sympathize with Lowen and make her edgy, then obviously this too failed. I am not a fan of authors using trauma porn, where excessively bad events are used to riddle backstories or even current stories. This is also an obvious pattern in CH other books. MC with tragic past, an asshole love interest with equally tragic circumstances = sexy times. Jeremy's daughters died and his wife is in a coma, but his character often showed little to no sadness while there were a lot of paragraphs describing how crushed he was. Guess he too was so horny that it was OK to cheat on his wife. Oh and the solution? Transfer her to a nursing home so he could hook up with Lowen as much as he wants? Bad execution, bad writing, bad everything. The end where he realizes truth about Verity and kind of kills her? It's treated as nothing. No consequence at all? He just goes on to make a lie about the incident and live a life with Lowen...like what the fuck? Where is the PTSD? Where is the follow up trauma or messed up mental health when you become a murderer of your murderous wife? 3. THAT ENDING....THAT DAMN ENDING. I said this is in my other reviews as well but the thing I dislike the MOST about the author is her endings. She's bad at writing them. There was a huge lead up on Verity being NOT comatose and there was the whole creepy thing going on with her but in the end. No psychotic behavior at all? She just opens her eyes and admit she was lying and that's it??? Then she dies??????? Like what was the point in a psychotic character if she was gonna do that??? It all felt so flat?? ALSO the letter at the end that makes us doubt if Verity was actually a victim and Jeremy was the villain?? Like no that's not an amazing twist or anything, that's CH trying too hard. This kind of plot twist is overdone, it's a cliche you will find in horror movies or thrillers from early 2000s. I expected better. In a nutshell, I have ISSUES with this book. It could have done better. But this is where Hoover and I part ways. I won't be reading her books anymore.","Check out my 7 better thriller recs to read instead of Verity on YouTube💖 Writing: offensively bad/5 | Plot: nonexistent/5 | Ending: abysmal/5  THE PLOT Lowen is a struggling writer who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to co-write a series with acclaimed author, Verity Crawford. When she arrives at Verity's home to do some research, she comes across a disturbing autobiography revealing the truth about all the tragic events in her life. Should Lowen let Verity's ""dreamy"" husband, Jeremy, know wassup? Or just sex him instead? Find out! MY OPINION NOW LET'S BUCKLE TF IN BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO BE A ROUGH RIDE (not the sexual kind Verity LOVED). I want to keep this ""short"", but I'm not sure I have it in me. This book tops Stay Awake and Unmissing by a MILE. I picked this up even though romance isn't my thing because I literally cannot log onto Goodreads without seeing a Colleen Hoover book. So I had to find out for myself, and I certainly did, and as they say... curiosity killed the cat. OK. SO LET'S GET INTO IT. - Lowen was unnecessary. Literally this whole story could be told without her POV. You could've just had the diary entries as a POV, with Jeremy struggling in real life, and then BAM that ""twist"" at the end. Not only was she unnecessary, but she was ANNOYING. BIG pick me energy. So you thought Amos choking you was rock bottom but you sexing a comatose woman's husband in her marital bed was chill? Ight. And honestly her whole sleepwalking story to create empathy in the reader was garbagio. - The writing was appallingly bad. This was BEYOND closed caption ass writing. Even a blind person didn't need this much detail. Did we need to know that Verity's writing software of choice is Microsoft word? No. Did we need to know that Lowen picked up her drink, took it to the stove, filled her bowl was spaghetti, reheated it in the microwave, then went to the fridge to grab a glass of water before sitting down at the dining room table? NO. But yet we do. - The gratuitous sex was literally like being in a 14 yo boy's wet dream. DISGUSTING. I literally skipped PAGES and PAGES of sex. What in the 50 shades of gross is this? How did it add to the story? If you're horny, there's p0rn. PLZ. We don't need this in a ""thriller."" ALSO. The whole ""oh I was just exaggerating for the sake of it"" doesn't hold up WHEN YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS ARE LITERALLY SEXING IN THE EXACT WAY YOU DEPICTED IT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SO??????? - Jeremy had the personality of a wet cardboard box. Legit how did ANYONE fall in love with the man when he said/did nothing of substance. This is what they call dickmatized. Free my ladies. - Also, also... this book did no favours for writers tbh. Saying shit like ""I write suspense novels, of course I know about your girlfriend"" doesn't make any sense???? I'm not like WOW HER BRAIN, I'm like... wow.... is her brain ok? What is the correlation? I'M ABOUT TO WRITE SOME SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK - Plot holes? Nah, plot CRATERS. How did she fake the brain scans? Why didn't Jeremy just kill her when she came home from the hospital? (maybe I missed something?) Girl is up at night sneaking around opening bank accounts but can't reach out to a friend and be like HALP??? And don't use this whole autobiography as the reason, because your publisher could corroborate your story and you're telling me you never discussed it with her afterward????- The letter at the end was atrocious. A perfect example of when authors try to hand-hold the reader through the twist to make sure it lands. I didn't need a perfect play-by-play of what your pretending ass was up to in a letter. I gleaned it from you just saying ""SIKE I WAS FAKING."" - Lowen ""forgiving"" or ""justifying"" Jeremy's double murder attempts was brutal. C'mon. Not during women's history month.

history, and how evolved the first stone age groups of chief, medicine man, dealer, and strongest soldier until today and will develop in the future?  An all time problem until enlightenment kicks in in a faraway utopiaIt´s not just the realm of religion that has had its fake news problem since the first primitive cults and sects tens of thousands of years or even longer ago. It´s each field and area of human activity that was, can, and will be influenced by the dark forces in the background, the puppet masters controlling the fate of both tribes of thousands in the past or states and space colonies of billions in the future.  Faith vs science, subjectivity vs objectivity, emotionality vs rationality,Call it as you like, I can´t objectively say much about the epic, endless science vs faith battle, because I am biased as heck and it would go against the obligation of a responsible reviewer to add too much subjective... Go science, show who is the boss, yes, keep using that chokehold,… A subjective interpretation: I am reading nonfiction for over 20 years and must say that much that has once been deemed impossible, wrong, or lies, became true and influenced the lives of everyone in massive ways. So the truth seems to be pretty flexible. And the lucky ones of us living in so called enlightened democracies could reverse engineer big and progressive history and guess how much of, well, everything could be wrong, lies, and pure fiction. That it´s the opposite of official history in some cases, that many of the weirdo theories about the present and future are the truth, and much of what is written in history books are lies.  Monetarizing this concept was an ingenious idea by Brown (and his not so well known predecessors?)And I don´t understand the Brown bashing of some people, many authors don´t really care much about the rules of writing or create average quality of consistency, logic, dialogues, and stuff and don´t get criticized for it. It might be possible that it´s more the inconvenient topics Browns is using that are activating the bite reflexes and reactionary mental programs of pissed people preferring proselytizing priests. The fast paced writing style with many different settings, fine infodumps, cliffhangers, and everything similar to a well written Hollywood blockbusters, techno- and psychothrillers is nothing people are ranting about as long as it´s not controversial. At least the lectors tried to pimp the real scienceIt´s possible that the new editions of the book have been edited and corrected ( I don´t know), as there are some errors regarding the possibility of the involved physics and technology and wrong descriptions. But as I know publishing houses, they probably still haven´t invested the money to fix the bugs, even in a multi million copies world bestseller, that uses the intentionally produced good old catholic church and JC controversies like no series before.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspir..."
Sharp Objects,Gillian Flynn,4.01,"“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.”
There is something deeply unhealthy about this book. It's in the characters, in the story, in the relationships, in the sex, and just in the general mood of the novel. Reading this made me feel a little unwell, both physically and mentally, but I am glad I did. If you know me, you'll know I love complex characters with issues that feel raw and real, rather than melodramatic. The people in this novel are majorly fucked up, no one is without a dark past and everyone, it seems, has a horror story.The protagonist - Camille Preaker - was just thirteen when her sister died and fuelled by grief (amongst other things) Camille spent her teen years carving words into her flesh, covering almost every inch of her body with the marks of her pain. Ten years later, Camille Preaker is now a journalist who returns to the small town of her youth to report on the murders of two young girls - girls who had had all of their teeth removed.Camille is soon caught up in the town once again, she tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the troublesome half sister she hardly knows. It seems that once again small towns hold the biggest secrets and Camille finds herself getting dragged deeper and deeper into the investigation, her fragile state of mind constantly threatening to tip her over the edge.This is one mean and nasty book. I knew I was getting a dark, psychological thriller, but I expected something on par with In The Woods by Tana French. Um, not exactly. Flynn never shies away from the horrific details. You're not going to find anything pleasant in this story; sex, for example, is always something complex - it's an escape or a bargain or a catharsis. Everything else is similar.Flynn does a fantastic job of challenging the notion that women are weak, innocent, damsels in distress. In a world where women are victims - both in their media representation and in statistics - this is a very interesting look at other kinds of women. It's programmed into us to believe that women are safer, kinder, built with an instinct that makes it difficult for them to be cruel and cause pain without reason. Maybe we were always wrong.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store","The razor blade on the front cover of the book is what one yearns for right after embarking on this read, sharp blade with which to cut every single page, one by one, until they are so neatly shredded that even the memory of what was written on them becomes non existent. And then, one can use the same razor to end one's own life. I'm still unsure what the author was thinking when she began this book, unless she had some very deep and very disturbing mental issues to work through. This book is dangerous and not because it excites one with a thrilling and suspenseful story. It is dangerous because once one reads it, one loses any desire to look for another book that may restore one's faith in the existence of good books with an uplifting charge. Not only is this book dangerous, but it is sick. Its underlying sickness is that it's emotionally draining and unless readers are looking to load up on more mental baggage (I can't think of anyone who doesn't have enough), I'd stay away from its pain. The main character is a female reporter who returns home on an assignment (covering the serial murders of two little girls). As memories of her painful childhood emerge, readers find a lot more about her character, for example her alcoholic addiction and her obsession to carve words into her own flesh. Waves of her unresolved issues wash away further hopes of a challenging literary work as readers are practically dragged into her problems (not loved enough by her mother, not popular enough in school, not motivated enough in her work) and are subjected to the anguish of either feeling sorry for her or wanting to end her existence. As disturbing details of the two murders resurface, readers are introduced to yet two more characters as equally unpleasant as the first. There is the psychologically unstable (almost emotionally poisonous) personality of her mother and the pathologically sinister and equally disturbed one of the teenage sister. And of course there are the endlessly problematic and mentally crushing details of the small-town's Midwest America (why would one want to read this is beyond my understanding). This book robs one of smiles, of the beauty of life, and even of the reason for love. It is not only bitter, but leaves one with an unpleasant smell of what I'd like to call rotten feelings. I can't brand the book dull (as it did leave me with unwanted thoughts), but I can promise you that you'll feel dull once you've read it. I don't recommend it, but may compare the feelings I have for it to what Chuck Palahniuk's 'Choke' birthed in me.","2.5 Stars. Unfortunately, I did not love this book and it is probably my least favorite of Gillian Flynn's work. As this was her debut, I'm happy to say I feel her later works show great improvement and a lot of strength.CW: self-harm, sexualization of children, murder, child abuse (I don't normally put content warnings under spoilers but this warning is so integral to the ending AND it's so specific that I don't want people attacking me for spoiling the book) Munchausen By Proxy I think Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer, but it was quite obvious that Sharp Objects was her debut. Her prose remains easy to engage with, but it is much more simplistic compared to her later works. That being said, the writing was one of the elements I actually appreciated in this story.I didn't particularly love the plot of the story. The idea of children being murdered and a journalist having to return to their small hometown was super intriguing to me, but the execution fell flat in my opinion. The ""darkness"" I constantly see associated with this book is definitely present - this book is not for the faint of heart, but truthfully, the story was boring in my opinion. I understand some people love small-town stories that focus on gossip and rumors, but it's not my cup of tea. I was missing the exhilarating plot twists from Gone Girl and Dark Places. It was very slow and for the most part, anticlimactic to me. I felt there were so many opportunities for more enticing, eventful scenes to be included but it was taken over by bland character interactions.The big reveals/plot twists are difficult to discuss because my experience is an amalgamation of ""This is surprising"" and ""This is expected."" I feel the best way to describe it is I felt the resolution of the story was clever and well constructed, but it was partially anticipated. I feel the minute details surrounding the resolution were stronger than the big reveal itself if that makes sense. Additionally, the ending felt very rushed as the truth of the mystery is revealed through Camille recollecting the events instead of being shown actively through the story. I think it would have been much stronger had we followed the revaluation in real-time along with Camille's initial reactions as opposed to having the events relayed to readers at a later time. Again, I feel this is a marker of this novel being Flynn's debut work and I can confirm that there is little ""telling, not showing"" in her future books. Overall, I wasn't a fan of Sharp Objects, I think it just wasn't for me, but I'll continue to love Gillian Flynn's work."
The Woman in the Window,A.J. Finn,3.94,"Who knows what goes on in a family?
Okay, I really don't want to misrepresent this book: The Woman in the Window is a pulpy, fast-paced popcorn thriller. It's not mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it is pageturning goodness. And it was exactly what I needed to get lost in right now.The premise is a little bit of The Girl on the Train and a little bit of The Woman in Cabin 10 (what is it with these girl/woman/wife titles?!), with an unreliable narrator, faulty memories, alcoholism, and the author playing around with our perception of what is true and what is imagined. My need to know what would happen kept me turning pages late into the night until I was physically incapable of keeping my eyes open a moment longer.The Woman in the Window treats a rather obvious plot element as a spoiler for most of the book, so I'll play coy too. It's about a woman called Anna who lives alone ever since separating from her husband and daughter. We're not told the circumstances of the separation, but we do know that Anna has a drinking problem and severe agoraphobia that prevents her from leaving the house.Housebound and drunk, Anna spends her days spying on her neighbours, until one day she witnesses something shocking in the window of the Russell's home. Everything begins to unravel when Anna attempts to report what she saw, and soon everything is being questioned: Did Anna hallucinate? Is it a combination of alcohol and pills? Can she even trust herself?The chapters are short and hard-hitting, making the fast-moving plot zip by even faster (""This is the LAST chapter. Oh wait, the next is only two pages? Okay, this is the last chapter""). I think the author does a great job of capturing both the fuzzy-headed confusion brought on by Anna's alcoholism and the suffocating claustrophobia of staying inside for almost a year. She makes for a pretty great unreliable narrator, and it is easy to feel her frustration when she can't even be sure herself if what she says is completely true.I also really liked how the author included Anna's passion for classic thriller movies. These offer interesting parallels with her reality and make you question whether something really did happen, or if Anna just saw it in a movie. Plus there's something a bit creepy about all these black and white flicks playing out in the background.The Woman in the Window is the kind of cozy psychological thriller that is easy to gobble up in a sitting or two. I didn't even mind that some things were obvious because the getting there was so damn fun and suspenseful. I'll be on the lookout for more from Finn.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube","3 STARSYou don't know how happy I was to get my greedy little paws on both the audio and Kindle versions of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. My expectations were through the roof! Have you seen all those 5 star reviews? As it turns out, the book doesn't live up to the hype. Yes, it is as addictive as popcorn, I couldn't put it down. But, there are so many disappointing drawbacks that I couldn't rate it a 4 star read.For audio-lovers, do not waste your precious Audible credit on this one. It is absolute trash. The actress portraying our boozy, traumatized victim/narrator is chirpy and confident sounding. Talk about a mindf*k! It does not work. In contrast, a similar book, The Girl on the Train is sheer perfection on audio. At about 40%, I turned off the audio, opened my Kindle and aaaaahhhh...the world made sense again. You know how much I love my unreliable narrators and our girl, Anna, is a doozy. Although she is terrified to step outside of her home, all kinds of interesting events still manage to take place in her small neighborhood. She spies on the nearby residents out of boredom. She's a regular Gladys Kravitz (you know, from Bewitched?). We can't trust Anna's narration because she is depressed and suffering from a traumatic event. And she pops a lot of pills and glugs wine as a chaser. Yeah, her take on the neighbors is suspect at best. All this is great. Absorbing. But, you know those people that use too many words and make simple matters overly boring? AJ Finn is one of those kind of writers. My patience runs thin with passages like this:Frigid air seizes my body, so raw that my heart feels faint; storms my clothes, sets them trembling around me. My ears brim with the sound of wind. I'm filling up with cold, running over with cold.Ugggghhhhh. I think she's cold. The book is so long and repetitive. It has an interesting, yet heavily borrowed upon plot and there are a couple of major twists. The plot twists are predictable, you will see them from a mile away, but it is still fun to see if your hunches were right (they will be). Just one more thing. Finn shoves a ton of film references into the storyline. At first, I loved it. Then, it becomes too much. It's as if he's saying, ""I'm not borrowing plot lines, I'm just referencing them."" Wink-wink. It's all too heavy handed and cutesy, we know what's really going on. There is not a single original concept about this book. Ultimately, underwhelming.","Update… Paul and I just watched the movie….. Great Cast….. but much darker - much more gruesome- - didn’t follow the book impeccably at all— and not nearly as good as as the book……My goodness…… they dramatized the violent graphics in the movie - but never fully developed the characters. Oh well… what did others think of the film? Curious. Older original ‘book’ review: NO SPOILERSThis is a solid 4 Stars for me. It’s been awhile since I’ve read a psychological suspense thriller —-a surprise gift in the mail. My copy says a film is already in the making. I can definitely see this novel as a movie. It should be good! The book is good. There are a few other reviews about the plot already ....so I’m going to simply list some random thoughts about my experience reading it. ....I enjoyed the premises of this story. Anna Fox being a child psychologist with a psychological disorder herself was interesting: agoraphobia. ....I liked Anna ....I liked Anna as the narrator. She kept me reading through the dark hours of the night. .....Nothing was ever too chilling or too graphic. The one violent scene was pretty mild for a book like this.... which I appreciate.....I never thought Anna was looking out her window - with her camera in hand - just to be creepy. From the start - I suspected her looking out the window had another element- but nothing to do with the purpose of stalking, per say. It’s hard to explain, but it was a ‘feeling’ I had....yet she did look through neighbors windows.....There was one surprise that was ‘really’ big for me — so much so -that I said to myself: “HOT DAMN, how do you like those crackers”? .....The title of this book is great - and not ‘as’ obvious as seems from the start. .....EACH of the characters are developed enough - just enough actually - they ride along with us ( the reader) as we are trying to figure what the heck happened:1. To Anna2. To a neighbor.....The 5 Story house that Anna lives in creates a great atmosphere.....Anna’s pill poppin wine drinking throughout didn’t alter my basic impression of Anna. I always felt that she was level-headed, and playing with a full deck - ( no matter how much drinking she did).....but was I wrong?Hmmmmm I’m not sayin!For a psychological thriller......this was unputdownable for me.... but not in a nailbiting way. I didn’t find it slow - or riveting....rather quietly gloriously-awesome.***note: This book sounds 'long' with almost 450 pages --but.....they are 'very' short chapters.Some pages only have a few words. Its a fast read!"

: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...","(A-) 82% | Very GoodNotes: An entirely different mood, pace and atmosphere than its predecessor, it thrives off the strength of a single character.","I was worried I wouldn't like this one as much as book one but it was still great! I love how Larsson has no issues writing very misogynistic characters without coming off as misogynistic himself. Some authors should take note.With that said, while I understand that Salander is a morally grey character, I don't understand why the author felt the need for her to have sex with a 16yo when she's 25..."
Dark Places,Gillian Flynn,3.94,"“I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.”
I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity. Okay, sorry, I make it sound so negative when actually this book is pretty fantastic if you can stomach the horrors within. I ate this up in a couple of days, finding every opportunity to read that I could... Flynn certainly has a talent for dragging you into her stories and having them take you over until you find out just what the hell is going on.As much as I enjoyed its dark predecessor - Sharp Objects - I think Dark Places was, for me, a more complex and well-developed mystery. I had many theories as to what was going on and all of them were wrong. You know, I honestly think that writing a mystery story must be the most difficult of all, because the reader is your enemy. Most readers of mystery stories will analyse the information they're given, pull it apart, and try desperately to solve the mystery before the characters do - and yet, if they are successful, they feel disappointed. For an author to manage to pull out something both surprising and convincingly real at the end of all this, they have to have a talent for it.Dark Places alternates between the present day and 1985 when Ben Day allegedly massacred three members of his family, his sister - Libby - being the only one to escape and testify as a witness, sending Ben to a life in prison. Now, after years of living on the donations made by concerned members of the public, Libby Day has finally run out of money and is forced to earn some cash by making an appearance at a group meeting where the members believe Ben is innocent. At first, Libby is willing to write them off as crazy fanatics with a grisly obsession... but as more information is presented to her, she starts to question what really happened all those years ago.The story is told from three main points of view and, to say I'm not a fan of multiple perspectives, I thought it was done excellently. Patty Day is an exhausted mother-of-four who starts to fear her son is becoming involved in satanic rituals; torn between wanting to protect him and being a little afraid of what his behaviour means, we begin to question through her eyes whether the heavy metal-loving loner could really have it in him to become a murderer. Then we have Ben Day's point of view. Being inside his mind is a little frightening - we see how his thoughts become increasingly dark, how just wanting to have something normal can lead to the most abnormal behaviour... but does that mean he would really murder his family?And, of course, there is Libby Day. Libby Day is the reason I think I enjoy Flynn's novels so much. She is so imperfect, complex, selfish, violent... but somehow you manage to stay on her side. I have no idea how the author manages this, but I've always loved a protagonist with issues, the kind of issues that make them lash out in ways that would make you hate them if you weren't inside their head, understanding them. She does some horrible things and, though you don't necessarily forgive her for them, you are able to see why.If you're okay reading about filth, gore, and underage sex, then you should dive into this mystery straight away and immerse yourself in the disturbing but awesome mental workings of Gillian Flynn.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store","i was not a lovable child, and i'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult. draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs.gillian flynn sure does love writing about horrible people doing horrible things.and i sure do love reading about them. especially because she isn't one of those writers coasting on shock value and ""can you belieeeeeve a delicate flower of a woman is writing this??"" but she can really tell a story and i, for one, was completely surprised and pleased by the ending of this one.libby's mother and two older sisters were murdered when she was seven years old, apparently in some sort of satanic bloodbath masterminded by her older brother ben. she escaped and was instrumental in getting him put behind bars, in one of those ""lean on the kid and make them say what needs to be said to convict someone"" situations. twenty-five years later, she is a mess - a flat broke kleptomaniac, pissed off at the world, and terrible at any social expectations, until she is approached by a group whose specialty is studying violent crimes, trading memorabilia, constructing alternate scenarios of horrorshows; criminal tourists. and libby pumps them for cash while promising to look into the crime she lived through, and reconnect with her brother and father in order to solve a crime she believes has already been solved.but it is far from over, man. there are all kinds of things she is going to learn about that night, and about her family, and about her own self.and it's going to get creepy.it is great, great, great. it is not perfect - i personally had some difficulties with character motivation and behavior, but it doesn't matter because it all works within flynn's dirty little world, and she manages to convince you that these characters are going to do what they are going to do within their need-spheres, and just because it doesn't make sense to youuuuu, just be thankful for that, yeah?it is really chilling stuff - oh, god - remember the frenzy of satanic finger-pointing of the 80's? there were cults everywhere, right? all the animal sacrifices and the heavy metal music and the teenage killers under the spell of the dark one? and even though none of it ever panned out into anything, that frenzy, that imagined threat was so convincing to so many pearl-clutching mothers. it would be adorable now, except for reading this book, and remembering that actual people were accused and convicted because of half-whispered urban legends. oops.it's a great bloody crime story. its pacing is sublime; she always knows just how far to take the reader before switching up the focus to cause the maximum amount of anticipatory distress, she knows how to cover her tracks and how to deliver the most effective kaboom of an ending. and you might not like any of these characters, but you will still sympathize with them, despite your better instincts.i seem to have run out of gillian flynn books.more, please.come to my blog!","yo this book freaky, Ben real creepy and Libby kinda dumb"
Little Mercy: Poems,Robin  Walter,4.22,"Vinc de Seuss i dels seus poemes llargs i narratius. Aquest llibre, en canvi, està fet de poemes curts, versos d'una sola paraula, sovint, construïts com es podria construir un niu, branquilló a branquilló. I m'ha agradat molt.","The keenly observed poems in Little Mercy are meditations on the magic of paying attention, of immersing oneself in the rhythms of a wren visiting her nestlings, of noticing the morning sun seeming to revolve around a daisy, or delighting in the the finer points of the letter ""j."" There's a self-consciousness to the poems. In multiple places, the speaker mentions considering some writing choice--say, how to describe the color of a worm--then goes on to make the choice. It's an expressed uncertainty that's vulnerable and appealing, and yet adds to the sense of inner turmoil roiling just beneath the surface of all the vivid nature imagery. In this collection, the solace that nature has to offer filters through grief and pain on its way to the page--and it becomes richer and more textured in the process.Little Mercy is a joy to read. The poems are accessible, and there are flashes of memorable poetic language throughout. Because of some funky formatting in my digital review copy, it was hard to tell where one poem ended and the next one began, but that ended up working just fine for me. You really can read and enjoy the collection as one extended book-length poem. My thanks to NetGalley and Graywolf Press for providing me with a copy of Little Mercy in exchange for my review.","I cannot recall the last time I came across poetry -- not to mention an entire book of poems -- that so evoked what it means to be alive, while comparing life's passages with those of nature. Robin Walter's language is evocative, playful, plaintive, surprising and sprinkled with aha moments. She is, quite simply, in the truest sense of the word, wonderful!"
The Rose: Poems,Ariana Reines,4.38,never disappointed by ariana reines. my only regret is now i have to wait for the next book to come out 😪,"The Rose is a provocative collection of poetry that, like the flower from which it takes its name, offers sweetness or suffering depending on your approach. This is raw unadulterated poetry, cut with black tar candor and heated until incandescent over a fierce flame of lasciviousness. Many of the poems are quite sexually charged (though seldom erotic). One of my favorites in the collection, ‘After Coming’, cheerfully scuppers the notion of “post nut clarity” and replaces it with a beguiling post orgasmic mania- one in which the poet is able to extract validation from her partner. It is a striking piece that explores the sometimes transactional nature of relationships. ‘Eros is bad’ ruminates on falling in love. Is it a happy accident like Alice floating downward or does it require more deliberate intention like Orpheus descending into the underworld? Medea, Aphrodite, and Prometheus all receive mentions and lend their mythological symbolism to the poetry. Yet, despite this occasional broadside from the western cannon the poems feel contemporary, experimental and suffused with vivid but oblique imagery. A skillful poet, Ariana Reines, has transformed the barren underworld into a fertile womb from whence chimeric (and thirsty) poetry springs forth.",not my fav of hers but hard to not enjoy spending time in her voice. i think i end up a little not as into her more mystic voice as opposed to her more stein-inflected earlier work … but i’ve got a lot more to learn
Unsex Me Here,Aurora Mattia,4.71,"Unsex Me Here is one of the most intimate books I have ever read. Psychedelic and glittering with raw, tender emotion, Mattia's prose possesses an unmatched lyricality, turning each story into an aria of desire, loss, and becoming. Though the stories follow unique plotlines, from the grandiosity of Greek mythos to the soft soliloquies of heartbroken women, they are entwined together in their motifs. From drops of opal, to the whinny of a mare, to the ripe sweetness of a peach, Unsex Me Here connects the stories of transfeminine individuals across all of time and space. Reading this book is like experiencing the rapture from every angle. I can't recommend it enough!(Thank you Edelweiss for the ARC! Review copied from my Edelweiss account.)","Unsex Me Here is phenomenal, in the sense that it's an experience unlike any I've encountered--it's strikingly beautiful, unapologetically tragic, and exists thoroughly for itself, not for any reader's catharsis. Aurora Mattia weaves figures and experiences from her own life into stories that blur and break the lines between fiction and creative nonfiction, fantasy and realism, mythology and prophecy. She bends genre as if it's clay beneath her hands, as if her typewriter molds opals and faceted diamonds. Each sentence is beautiful and revelatory, their content profoundly intimate. The collection ends with a printed interview with Mattia that further discusses her process and opinions on writing.Read this collection if you want a book that will change you. It's an unmissable work of transfeminine literature, & Mattia is a writer of unparalleled skill.I borrowed an ARC of Unsex Me Here from my best friend Catherine, whose review you should also read!","⭐⭐⭐WOW amazing. id like to say more but honestly i never know what aurora is talking about but dang she writes so pretty 😍 my favorite piece was the cradle me, lucifer (the one about the snake) i also loved the passage about corpse flowers and peacocks from via crucis. thinking about getting peacocks and corpse flower tattoo. Anywhere, but particularly in the desert, a peacock is a dense epicenter of decadence. For the sake of this decadence, the peacock has sacrificed the sky, has forgone the function of flight in order to obtain a different function, that of artifice: or more precisely, communication. I mean to say, a peacock's feathers are a form of speech-and to all who witness them, pure poetry. But the shriek bursts forth from their gilded throats at the pitch of pain, striking my skull with such sudden violence that I am silenced by terror and awe. In the beauty of their feathers, etc., do you understand?So it also should come as no surprise that years after the end of this story, at a metropolitan botanical garden, having chanced upon one of those blossoms whose perfume is not sweet but putrid, whose temperature is equivalent to that of a human body, and who are known, to my delight, as corpse flowers, I fell in love. The function of their perfume is the same as that of any other flower, but the form inverts the logic of desire. The corpse flower asserts the allure of rot.To contextualize my latter-day visit to the botanical garden, I should mention that by the time I saw the as-it-were Amorphophallus titanum, I had come to understand myself as something other than a man, and also as something other than a woman. I am what pseudo-scientific discourses once called a transsexual. I am what you (in the solitude of your skull) might call 'disfigured,' or what I, in homage to Lady Macbeth, might call 'unsexed.' My pussy is, in the matter of reproduction, useless; it is understood by pseudoscientific discourses to be merely an inverted penis (read: misshapen phallus) or the facsimile of a vagina (read: formless phallus).But I understand my pussy to be a peacock feather, because it has forgone its prior function in order to obtain a different function, that of artifice: or more precisely, communication. I understand my pussy to be a corpse flower, because it asserts the allure of rot: You won't have any children with me, okay? But while the adaptations performed by the peacock and the corpse flower are considered natural, mine is considered artificial-because you have forgotten that we are not so far from birds and flowers.

a body more tolerable,jaye simpson,4.31,Just…so beautiful. SO beautiful. The tension between the words and the formatting was excellent. I can’t wait to read and devour this again in the future.,"I pre-ordered simpson's second volume of poetry from the publisher, and they sent it a bit early, which was a treat. The first volume, it was never going to be okay, is one of my favourites, especially the poem ""Sea Glass,"" but this new book is even better, highlighting simpson's growth as a poet in her incredible use of metaphors, allusions, and creative structural features that both confront and comfort. These are the poems of a writer both confident in their identity and in their abilities as a poet.I read through the whole book in one evening, unwilling to put it down, and I'll need to read it again more slowly (which is also another great excuse to appreciate its excellent cover art and design).","Thank you Arsenal Pulp Press for the E Arc, your titles never disappoint.a body more tolerable is jaye simpson's sophomore poetry collection and again jaye is able to compose words that walk the balance between soft and angry. I really enjoyed each poem and I did so much highlighting on my digital ARC copy. She truly is a wordsmith, and I will read anything that is planned after.At a time when we need more books by marginalized authors more then ever, I think a body more tolerable should absolutely be added to your TBR when it releases on March 25th. Trans voices are pivotal and writing like this creates a safe shore for Trans, Non Binary, Two Spirit and Indigenous Folx. I have already pre ordered this in anticipation, I suggest you do the same and through your local bookstore."

YEAR OF THE DRAGON: poems and meditations on the way,Ford Turrell,3.31,"Thank you NetGalley and Sunrise press for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. This is a short collection of poems. There were several poems that I liked, particularly the Red Light, Green Light ones, as they gave the feeling of stopping to take in your surroundings before rushing off again towards your goal, sort of like when you’re playing the game. There was also lots of nature imagery and commentary on politics and the current state of the world. I didn’t connect a whole lot with many of these poems, but poetry is highly subjective and other readers might connect more than I did. I did really like the structure of the one near the end that looked like a dragon or snake on the page, that was really cool.","A collection of stellar poems, fumbled by a disrespectful title choice*Edit 3/28/2025: The press team emailed me to say they agree the title comes off as cultural misappropriation. They said the acknowledgments will be changed to reflect the poet's connection and respect for Chinese culture. I still think it'd make more sense for the poems themselves to reflect cultural appreciation if this is the collection title, but I look forward to seeing the acknowledgment edits. This collection of poetry is an absolutely stunning repository of daily life. It uses striking nature imagery and sensory details. I was especially impressed by the formatting of the poems. I don't think I've ever seen creative poetry formatting add so much to the impact of the poems themselves. Reading the poems was a full-on Experience, and I can see myself coming back to them time and time again, the way I relisten to my favorite songs. My biggest qualm with this collection is the title. The Chinese zodiac and dragons in particular are important cultural symbols in many Asian countries. As an Asian person myself, I became incensed when I realized that the collection had nothing to do with Asian culture at all. The only mention of the dragon is in the same-titled last poem, and nothing about what dragons represent in Asian cultures was included. In the acknowledgments, the poet says the collection title was chosen because all the poems were written during 2024 (year of the dragon) and the poet was also born on a dragon year. Those are superficial reasons to choose a cultural symbol as a title. Plus, the poet appears to be white, so it feels like another instance of whitewashing a POC cultural symbol. I'm quite torn by this collection because I am deeply frustrated by the title, but the poems themselves are so undeniably wonderful that I can't help but want to share them with all my friends.","Dieser Gedichtband hat mir insgesamt gut gefallen, allerdings hatte ich das Gefühl, als würden vorrangig alltägliche Begebenheiten und Beobachtungen beschrieben werden, ohne dass ich hier einen Mehrwert für mich erkennen konnte. Die Gedichte sind zum Großteil eher kurz gehalten und nur wenige konnten mich berühren oder zum Nachdenken anregen. Ich kann daher nur teilweise eine Empfehlung aussprechen und würde einen Blick ins Buch vor dem Kauf empfehlen.In English:Overall, I enjoyed this volume of poetry, but I felt it primarily described everyday occurrences and observations without any real value for me. The poems are mostly rather short, and only a few touched me or stimulate my thinking. Therefore, I can only partially recommend it and would recommend taking a look at the book before purchasing."
Autopsy of an Ex-Teen Heartthrob,Avan Jogia,3.31,"this collection of poems explores the themes of love, fame, and the complexities of human emotions. avan jogia’s ability to capture fleeting moments of emotion in such a powerful way is truly remarkable. the poems in the beginning of the book were my personal favorite, especially ‘orange carpet.’avan jogia’s voice in poetry is fresh and unique. each poem felt like a small revelation, leaving readers with a sense of both awe and longing. avan’s personal journey is woven through every page, offering an open window into his world that feels deeply authentic and incredibly moving","Actual rating: 2.5⭐️Aggressively mid. Confused because of the reviewers who mention how watching him in Victorious as a child made them read (and love) this, which he complains about in his poems, time and time again. While I picked this up partially because of that, and because of Halsey (lol; I really enjoy them together), I only really liked like a few of this collection's poems. The one about moving past childhood nostalgia and making new memories was a treat! Also the one about the nice fan he met on the subway. The rest were mostly Jogia complaining about being a celebrity, and while he acknowledges that he's not nearly as famous as his peers, his work is a bit corny. I try to avoid calling something cringe (to be cringe is to be free), but...hm. Don't get me wrong, Hollywood is so ridiculously fucked up...but his writing...it's hard to empathize with Jogia when he's all, ""Sex is Ego. Sex is God. Sex is Life. Sex is feeling. Sex is"" blah, blah, blah. Also, I assumed he was in a bajillion or so films/shows with how he describes his grind, but he really only talked about Victorious which makes sense because...Beck...heartthrob...with I would've blissfully ignored if he was a more prolific writer. I listened to this while watching the river. I wouldn't suggest sitting down and reading this.",I loved victorious so of course I had to listen to this
Banned Together: Our Fight for Readers' Rights,"Ashley Hope Pérez (Editor/Contributor), Debbie Fong (Illustrator), Elana K.

A very informative and important book for our current times. I appreciate that this issue is being highlighted. This collection as a whole was very a enjoyable, if sometimes desperately sad, read.

Words with Wings and Magic Things,"Matthew Burgess, Doug Salati (illustrator)",4.27,"(3.75 rounded up) Cute, wholesome and endearing.

One Step Forward,Marcie Flinchum Atkins,3.87,"An extremely well-researched (the extensive footnotes at the end of the book are one of the strongest parts) novel in verse about the suffrage movement, told through the eyes of Matilda Young, the (aptly named) youngest suffragist to be thrown in jail. Atkins paints a deft picture of Matilda's journey from curious fourteen-year-old to eager but frightened suffragist to firebrand who, on the advice from suffrage leader Alice Paul, still feels fear but does not allow it to stop her. Especially in These Divided Times, I think this is an important book for young people to read—I'm a beneficiary of the suffrage movement, and even I, at my big age, was completely unaware of just how horrendous things were for the suffragists. And how, despite the horror, they didn't stop fighting until the fight was won, all so their daughters' daughters—us—could have a right that I think too many of us take for granted. (Also this book pairs nicely with the soundtrack to the Broadway musical Suffs, which made me cry no fewer than four times—all of that BEFORE I had to watch a woman lose the presidency to a Cheeto-colored fascist for the SECOND time in my young life, thanks very much).","One Step Forward was not a book I would typically read, but I have absolutely no regrets about picking up this read. Atkins manages to capture the powerful feelings, struggles, and motivations of female suffragists fighting for their right to vote, and does so in the unique and engaging style of verse. The main character and narrator, Matilda, is fiery and emotional, strong and also human. Atkins creates a character who demonstrates real emotions, like fear and admiration, and who, even in moments of weakness, displays incredible strength. One Step Forward is a powerful story about the harsh reality that was women's suffrage, and all that the women who came before us had to do to fight for their right to vote. This is truly such a powerful story that deserves to be shared with several generations to come.",Vote! Vote! Vote! I really enjoyed the author's note and info on the real people this book was inspired by.
Octopus Moon,Bobbie Pyron,4.47,"Having a mental illness can feel like you're an octopus. Not that you've got multiple tentacles, although I'm sure some hentai author could have a blast with that, but because octopuses don't have any sensory barriers between their hypersensitive suckers and the rest of the world. They feel everything, and that's what mental illnesses like anxiety and depression can feel like. Pearl develops depression when she's ten, and she can't make sense of the way her world has so suddenly changed. This book is about her exploration and understanding of what it means to be clinically depressed and how to navigate it.Although Pearl feels more seventh grade than fifth, this still does a phenomenal job of capturing what it feels like to grapple with an invisible illness. At one point her therapist remarks that it would be easier if Pearl had her arm in a cast, and that parallels what I remember telling my mother when I was thirteen - that it would be easier if I used a wheelchair because then people would believe that there was something wrong with me. Pearl's journey is difficult but relatable, and the author mentions in her afterword that she wrote this because it was the book she needed when she was ten.I hope that it's able to help the children (and adults) it needs to reach. Being an octopus isn't all bad once you learn to cope with it.","Octopus Moon is a middle grade novel-in-verse about the important, but often overlooked, topic of mental health in children. The main character, Pearl, experiences depression and anxiety and throughout the book she has to deal with many common stigmas related to mental illness. I think that this book is a must-read for parents, caregivers, and educators that work with young children because it can lend some insight into what depression and can anxiety look and feel like. I also appreciate that this book is presented in a verse format, which makes it more accessible to the readers that may need it the most.I thought the title of the book, Octopus Moon, was an interesting one, but as I read the story I understood why that title was chosen (a great talking point for parents or educators that read this book with students). One of my favorite aspects of this book was how the relationships of the characters progress over time. Of course Pearl was the main character, but we also got to see quite a bit from her parents, grandparents, sister, best friends, and therapist. The side characters added a lot of depth to the story and made it so many different perspectives were represented, so I feel like many young readers will be able to relate to at least one of the characters in some way.Overall, this book is one that I would highly recommend to young readers. I'm so glad that more authors and publishers are working to incorporate mental health into books for the middle grade audience and this one presents so many opportunities for adults to begin conversations with young readers. I also appreciated the way that the author shared her personal experiences with depression and anxiety in the author's note...I think that this element will help young readers understand that the story isn't entirely made up and that they're not alone in their thoughts and feelings. Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Young Readers Group for the opportunity to review an eARC of Octopus Moon!","Having recently finished “Octopus Moon” by Bobbie Pyron, I am happy to have had the chance for the Advanced Reader’s Edition e-copy; thank you NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP Penguin Young Readers Group/ Nancy Paulsen Books.“Where did my hard turtle shell go? The one I could hide in and not feel Everything.”I loved the beautiful and peaceful moments in Pearl’s favorite place: The Gulfarium- Denizens of the Deep exhibit. Ms. Pyron’s story takes us to Crescent Beach, Florida and time spent in 10 year-old Pearl’s other world, a world full of changes, depression and anxiety. Surrounded by family, friends and a caring therapist who helped her to know that:“Depression will tell you things about yourself that are not true.”Pearl began to understand that having a purpose, using techniques and knowing where her Happy Place was, would begin to help her heal from the struggles and dark times in her life.The Author’s Note includes a personal message and is full of resources and words of encouragement for those needing support as they begin the process of learning how to feel better."
13 Ways to Say Goodbye,Kate Fussner,3.92,I loved this one so much I blurbed it!! Fuller review coming closer to pub date <3,"How can a novel written for a middle-grade audience bring me to tears? Thank you to Kate Fussner and HarperCollins for the ARC.A quick and important read. I have never read a novel-in-verse but this has made me want to explore them more often.I connected to many things about how this was written.... The real, human depiction of all of the characters. The way queerness was explored gently and was just one facet of Nina, but was still given its moments of significance. The way the exploration of Paris was blended with language and memories.This book is so lovely, and I can see it really helping kids as they're growing, especially those who need a grief perspective or who want to see queer characters. It's coming out on March 18th, so please look into it.","13 Ways to Say Goodbye by Kate Fussner is the second book I have read by this author in two weeks and upon finishing it, I immediately ran to preorder a physical copy. This book follows Nina who is grieving over the sudden loss of her sister and as a way to manage her grief, she is determined to finish a list of things her sister made in Paris with her aunt. While she is there, she forms a connection with a girl named Sylvie. While exploring Paris, the connection grows deeper but what does it mean?I loved this book. The sapphic representation in a middle grade book is so important right now. I love that this is a novel in verse. It makes it more accessible to middle grade readers. Not all middle schoolers want to read regularly formatted novels so I love seeing books like this as an option. The grief representation in this is done so well. Not just with Nina but you also see how the loss affects her parents and the people around them. Grief is such a hard subject to write about, especially on a level that middle grade readers will understand but I think this was perfect. This book made Kate Fussner an autobuy author from me and I can’t wait to see what she writes next."
Doggerel: Poems,Reginald Dwayne Betts,4.22,"I was gifted a copy of this book by the publisher, and I feel so honoured because reading this was an absolute delight! As I expected from reviews I’d read, this book dives deep into themes of fatherhood and Black masculinity, but what I didn’t expect was the wry, witty tone. This is a collection that manages to make really insightful points without feeling like it takes itself too seriously. It’s accessible enough that I think newer readers of poetry will enjoy it, yet certainly well crafted enough that diehard poetry fans will also find a lot to love here. As a total dog person, I really enjoyed how many of the poems were about the writer’s beloved dogs.I definitely recommend this one to poetry fans as well as those wanting to dip their toes into the genre!",“…desiring mostly to be loved.”,"A velvety smooth midmorning spring breeze was blowing through the city of London when I sat down to read Reginald Dwayne Betts’s newest book of poetry in a flower shop cafe. Outside, the London sky was pristine blue. Sparkling and luxurious. An endless stratosphere where tufts of clouds slipped by, displaced and replaced with tufts of dreams. Big Ben chimed the hour and the sound of that hour fell languidly over the city, the country, the ends of the earth. Inside the veritable botanic garden I was warmly embraced by the whisper-soft scent of red roses, white roses, and a mix of nearly every other annual and perennial ever to have bloomed toward sun and moon. And there I sat, quietly turning page after page while I read and enjoyed poem after poem. “Doggerel” is a splendid work of poetry that is both Ivy League cerebral and street corner hip. The poems move and groove like jazz notes springing from the saxophone of Sonny Rollins. A beautiful and bodacious book that’s straight up sassy, classy, and a bit bad assy. It’s also a fun read, a memorable read, a read to think about and tell other people about. I’m telling you like it is, if you read just one book of poetry in 2025, treat yourself to “Doggerel.” Author Reginald Dwayne Betts is the Langston Hughes of the 21st century and reading his newest collection of jewel-like poems is as pleasing an experience as sitting in an English garden on a fresh spring day."
Glitch Girl!,Rainie Oet,3.90,"i cannot handle this stream of conciousness writing style. I am struggling too much to stay engaged with the characters. Also, it's a novel in verse but the poem structures feel halfhearted....DNF @page 50","I received an advance copy from the publisher via Netgalley for review purposes; this in no way influences my review.This book is intense and rough, but I’m glad it has a happy, hopeful ending. I don’t know how much I believe in the positivity of the ending based on the experiences prior, but also limited perspective is also going to shape my feelings of the earlier experiences J— had with her parents. The relationship she has with Junie also made me uncomfortable in ways because of the almost obsessive nature of it, but also I can see that being extremely relatable to others because of the feelings of “do I like her or do I want to be her?” that I think is at the root of J—‘s feelings for Junie. I like that it’s a story that covers three years and it gives a lot of space for J—‘s growth and self-discovery. I found this hard to put down and ended up reading it in one sitting when I should have gone to sleep (whoops), and think this does a lot of good things regarding gender feelings and understanding, as well as dealing with ADHD brain and the way society and those in power will punish you for being yourself, even as you’re doing your best to be “good.” Overall a really intense book that I’ll be thinking about for a while.","Glitch Girl! is a heartbreaking story about a very young trans girl(she/they) who's just trying to figure out their gender identity. Add to that their ADHD and, to a much lesser extent, their Russian Jewish upbringing. Told in verse, this story spans several years from elementary school to early high school while J---- figures out what it means to be themselves and how to navigate the problems they have with their ADHD. I don't get poetry, in general. And this type I get even less, to be perfectly honest with you. Mostly it feels like a regular story, but spaced out so it looks like a poem. There are a few instances where the spacing makes an impact, but overall, I just don't get it. That being said, this was so good, but SO hard to read as a mom of an enby kid. The MC is abused by their parents, both physically and mentally. And mentally by their teachers. The only adult that is kind is a friend's mom and the interaction is minimal. This was very hard for me to read. Release Date: 3/11/2025"

So is Penelope, and it shows throughout the story.• 𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐈𝐓’𝐒 𝐀𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐓Penelope Ross has always felt like a passenger in her mother’s fairytale - until the night of her 17th birthday, when she is forced to enter her own.After a text from her estranged mother rips her away from a night with friends, Penny is forced into a kaleidoscope of memories locked inside the dark labyrinth of her childhood home. As Penny wanders between present and past—prose and verse—she must confront her mother's opioid addiction to mend her fractured past. But the house is tricky. The house is impossible. It wants her to dig up the dead to escape. And as Penny walks through herself to find herself, she is not sure she has the courage to free the light she trapped inside.","""all the things that could make flowers bloom and weeds stand out""I so badly need a win this year haha I really liked some of the metaphors this one tried to get across especially how the majority of this is through the lens of a child trying to make the best of her situation, but a lot of them were lost on me and while the way the story was formatted to mark the difference between past and present worked well, I was still a bit confused on why the first part of the narrative happened and how we got to the ending scene. I also felt like a lot of the writing just wasn't that strong and really relied on certain shock factors to move the story along","Holy heaviness, beautiful and haunting.Penny is spending her birthday at a fair with her friends when she receives texts from her mom saying that she misses her. Penny races to her childhood home to check on her mom, and instead ends up confronting her own past as she navigates through the house and her own memories. The blend of verse for Penny's memories and prose for the present day is a great choice that adds intense emotional depth to Penny's situation; the verse depicts the emotion and pace of sifting through memory, jumping from one to the next as she moves from room to room in the house. The metaphor of Penny as the house might be lost on some teens, but I don't actually think that's entirely necessary for the message and feeling of the story to come across just as powerfully. It's a story about finding yourself, sifting through things you have experienced and ways people have treated you to see how it has shaped your view of yourself and what you deserve and how you move through the world. Truly heavy and the trigger warnings were helpful, but I think there are a lot of teens who would devour this. I'd hand this to folks who like Kathleen Glasgow's books or Anderson's Speak (there is a direct reference to it in this book) or Shout."

The Story of My Anger,Jasminne Mendez,4.67,“I need just a few more minutes before I'm forced to becomewho everyone else expects me to be.”,"Yulieta Lopez is furious. Furious at her drama teacher who won’t cast Black students in lead roles. Furious at the school board for targeting her favorite teacher over “controversial” books. Furious that her only escape plan is to stay quiet until she can finally leave Texas behind.Yuli knows how to play her parts well—the obedient daughter, the selfless girl who always puts others first. But when her anger starts to burn brighter than her fear, silence is no longer an option. Fueled by righteous rage, Yuli and her friends launch a guerrilla theatre group that shakes up their school and sparks real conversation. And as the curtain rises, Yuli steps into the role she was always meant to play—her own.This was an incredible foray into YA Novel in Verse. However it wasn't just NiV, it had some prose and some parts were written like a play, with stage directions included. I read it in one sitting and want to go back and reread it again. Yuli's passion for fighting for what she believes in, while trying to squash her anger and fire builds across the pages so much so that as the reader I could feel her frustration at not being able to express her voice, her desire to be seen. Mendez addresses so many issues that kids and teachers are facing in Texas, especially book bans. She nailed exactly how Ss/Ts feel about the suppression of their voices and how others think their voices are the only ones that matter. I had never heard of guerilla theater before and found it a very intriguing way to share one's voice.This is another of my top ten for the year. I cannot wait for it to come out and add it to the collection.","I received an advance copy from the publisher via Netgalley for review purposes; this in no way influences my review.The Story of my Anger is a perfect firestorm of a story. Yuli and her anger and her community and the love around her were all so wonderful and, especially in the current sociopolitical climate, is so incredibly important. I love seeing stories where Black girls are allowed the space to be angry and have fire inside them, as well as space to fall apart and be held together by those who love them. There are so many fantastic references to other important literature, and I cannot wait to try some of the stories and books mentioned. This was a book I couldn’t put down, and I can’t wait for it to find people and be a spark of change and hope."

If reading such lines still make us feel uncomfortable then I feel we still have a long way to go. I feel we need to express ourselves and it's our right to celebrate our bodies and our thoughts which others are so ready to judge and demean.I find the writing thoroughly genuine and refreshing. I appreciate it more when the author expressed her concern over the unrealistic expectations to write more so that her work would bring her 'more' of what others believe would bring. The sketches in between presently represents the sentiments behind the lines. As always, I love her poetry when it brings up issues about mental health, relationships and women. But what I loved more about this collection was the way how the issues of productivity, writing, immigrants and a bit of politics were brought up.I find the cover a bit underwhelming but yes, it's the contents that matter more!"

Time Is a Mother,Ocean Vuong,3.93,"It physically pains me to give Ocean Vuong anything less than five stars.  I read Night Sky with Exit Wounds, Vuong’s debut poetry collection, and was astounded at his ability to upend me so completely with a few well-turned stanzas. My mind still snags on half-remembered lines from On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, his first novel, which I loved so much I carried it around reverently in my backpack for months. I've even transcribed some of his interviews and lectures because that’s how deeply I was caught up in the flow of Vuong's wonderful, clear-eyed insights. Which is to say—I bought Time is a Mother with a kind of electric hunger for it. I’ve long admired Vuong’s craft, his sincerity, how utterly courageous he is in terms of hammering out of language what is for many of us inexpressible private realities. His work offered me a new angle of seeing the world, new ways of thinking about language and survival and laughter and the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage.There are definite flashes of that in Time is a Mother, particularly in poems such as Amazon History of a Former Nail Salon Worker, a raw and intimate piece detailing the online purchases made by Vuong's mother before her death, and Reasons for Staying which carries a line—“Because my uncle never killed himself—but / simply died, on purpose.”—that still haunts me. American Legend is, however, far and away my favorite poem. In it, the speaker recounts a car accident that brought him literally close with his emotionally absent father, and the physical collision the poem depicts is collision I felt, an emotional blow: “I wanted, at last, to feel him / against me—& / it worked […] he slammed / into me & / we hugged / for the first time / in decades. It was perfect / & wrong, like money / on fire.” It is in these poems that I felt most keenly the poet’s words: “The blood inside my hands is now inside the world.” The rest of the collection I read without really tasting any of it. Most of the poems are bloodless, with no real depth or warmth, and as a whole, they are aimless and disconnected where they should meld seamlessly into each other. Further, lines like “Oh no. The sadness is intensifying. How rude” just made me cringe. Others like “I kept my hope / -blue Vans on/this whole time / to distract you / from my flat ass” made me sputter with incredulous laughter. Like, I'm sorry, what. With that said, there’s no doubt that Vuong is one of the brightest literary minds around, and an absolute magician with language. Don’t let this review discourage you from seeking out his other work (including his lectures and interviews).","This is my first work by Ocean Vuong, and I wasn’t disappointed. This is a collection of poetry, and I had both a copy of the text and the audiobook (authors just love me). This author reminded me so much of T.S Eliot because the poetry would evoke such clear imagery. There was one scene which described the sounds of cooking that I was actually smelling the food. Here are a few of my favorite lines:I thought the fall would kill me but it only made me realI just don’t believe in time.It doesn’t have to make sense to be realI want to take care of the planet because I need a beautiful graveyard. I am wrong often—but not enough to forget you.If I had to pick between the text or the audiobook, I would hands down pick the audiobook. Some of the formatting of the poems made it difficult to understand where to pause and take a breath. If I was reading the poems on my own, they would not have had the intended flow by the author.  These poems were phenomenal, but they were written after Vuong’s mother died so some of them are pretty dark. Although this might be my first book of poetry by Vuong, I certainly hope that it is not my last.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta","‘Nobody’s free without breaking open.’2016 saw the rise of Ocean Vuong with his incredible and well-lauded debut collection of poetry. Deservedly so as Vuong has a gift of language to discuss difficult and painful subjects in a way that illuminates them in beauty. Time is a Mother, his second full-length volume of poetry, makes good on his early promises of excellence as Vuong examines grief from a multitude of vantage points, be it grief from loss of a loved one or a country. Following his debut novel, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, an autobiographically informed work that centers on the death of his mother, here we find poems that extend the theme and processing of grief, frequently drawing parallels between human and animal bodies as if to remind us that any loss is tragic. He simultaneously grieves the loss of cultural identity as one ages in the United States instead of a home country where the scars of war stand out in the family history of relocation. Vuong is at his best when playing with form and in the longer poems that give room for experimentation and compounding of an idea, and Time is a Mother is a gorgeous and heartbreaking collection that is as teeming with emotion as it is poetic integrity and execution.‘You’re smiling because the starsare just stars & you knowwe’ll only live oncethis time.’There are few aspects of life more universal than the mourning of death, and birth and the inevitability of dying are two things we all have in common. ‘Lest we forget, a morgue is also a community center,’ Vuong writes, and these poems are something we can all come together around and harmonize about the human condition. Time is a Mother feels the natural follow-up to Vuong’s novel like an abstract afterword as commentary on what had transpired in the book but also a bridge forward to whatever will come next. In these pages we see the whole of Vuong’s life, such as family members, generational trauma, musings on identity and more culminate into the grieving process and an inward look at one’s small position in a vast universe as memories show they have emotional barbs and processing pain and feeling the weight of existence becomes a necessity to continue living.‘Because this mess I made, I made with love.’There are a wonderful variety of techniques utilized here, from short poems that deliver a staccatoed burst of images to multipage emotional epics and dense prose poems that read nearly like deleted scenes from Vuong’s novel. Personally, the more daring and experimental poems or longs ones work best for me, such as the poem Reasns for Staying, an emotional knock-out inspired by his Vuong’s uncle who took his own life in 2012 that lists soul-stirring moments of life that uphold the beauty of existence. ‘Because they came in to my life, these ghosts, like something poured,’ he writes as he lists reasons to live that include rain falling on his partner’s shoulder, reading ‘my books by the light of riotfire,’ or ‘because this body is my last address.’ In another poem he lists the Amazon purchases of his mother over the course of a year, a narrative of a life suddenly upended by cancer slowly and cleverly being revealed by the list of items in a way that touches on the way details of our lives become marketing data for corporations to sell us products. List poems appear several times in this collection, with Old Glory listing common phrases to show how normalized violence and death is into our language. It makes us stop and consider how phrases like telling someone to “go in guns blazing” might not seem like positive encouragement to someone who has experienced war or been a family of refugees. Some of the later poems are written as dense prose poems, which aren’t my favorite personally, but Vuong packs a lot of emotion into them.‘Because the fairy tales were right. You’ll need sorcery to make it out of here.’The grief in these poems is not only for those who have passed, but also for the living who are marginalized by society. ‘I used to be a fag now I’m a checkbox,’ he writes in Not Even a poem that later details a scene where a white woman tells him he is lucky that his identity as a queer immigrant lets him write about war and sexuality. ‘Because everyone knows yellow pain, pressed into American letters, turns to gold,’ he remarks, commenting on how his griefs aren’t simply a marketing trick and that the idea of being jealous of it is rather disturbing. Time is a Mother is an impactful collection that shows Vuong has plenty more to say and will continue to be a big name in poetry. While it doesn’t hit me as strongly as the first collection, which is so endlessly quotable, it is still quite an impressive collection that resonates and left me thinking of these poems when I was away from them. May we be reading Ocean Vuong for a long time to come. 3.75/5‘How else do we return to ourselves but to foldThe page so it points to the good part.’"
Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,Lana Del Rey,3.99,"Lana Del Rey has tight control over her meter, rhythm, and rhyme -- like allowing a yo-yo to unravel itself yet all-the-while maintaining the power to pull it right back, exploiting its spin. Her distinctive tone and ethereal language are unmistakably Lana, but there's also homage to Sylvia Plath in the assonance which is delicious to read aloud. It feels even more vulnerable than her music, especially in the physical edition where the drafts of some poems are printed alongside the refined final versions -- the construction lines behind the rich LA landscape she details. It's a shame about the haikus at the end, which brought my rating down from 4 to 3 stars, as they appear underdeveloped and unnecessary, especially in contrast to the dense imagery and taut poetry she writes so beautifully elsewhere.",full review to come.she’s coming to end shakespeare’s career and feed the gays.,"Okay so i know i’m not supposed to be biased during a review but screw it... it’s our goddess we’re talking about here. I've been in love with the Queen of Coney Island for years so this gets a solid 5/5. First of all, I just wanna say I'm happy as heck and so proud of her; in the legendary monologue of Ride, she says ""I was a singer. Not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky."" Well Lana, you freaking made it and you truly are the most beautiful poet. Thankful for the journey of yours and so so overwhelmed with the appreciation and recognition you're getting. Now; she has only released a few snippets of her book, but so far, they're all amazing and you can literally hear the UV era coming out in some of them... what more could you want? My personal favourite is ""past the bushes cypress thriving."" My oh my. What a masterpiece. For true fans, you know that she loves referencing flowers, peaches, beaches, etc. She did it again and I'm so here for it. Every line from ""carrying the air differently"" to ""you don't want to be forgotten, you just want to disappear"" is heaven. I'm in love. This isn't Rupi Kaur or Lang Leav or R.h Sin poetry; this requires reading between the lines and picking it apart however you want because you'll feel so many emotions at once. That's how she always makes people feel. Love, peace, commitment, solidarity; you feel it all and that's how true poetry should be. I'm definitely fangirling right now like crazy, but she deserves it. Her poetry is a breath of fresh air and something we so desperately need to remind us who we are and what to look for in life. Cannot wait for this to be released, along with NFR!!"
"Love, Pamela",Pamela Anderson,3.81,I fucking loved this. It was a true surprise. I was expecting a spill the tea dishy memoir and got poetry and existential philosophy in a completely palatable way. Truly an enigma in a red bathing suit. I highly recommend this book. Hers is a story worth learning about.,"Confession: my first celebrity crush was Pamela Anderson. I was six years old and thought CJ from Baywatch was great. I wanted to be her friend. I later discovered Pamela had endured her share of adversity, but didn’t realise the full extent - until now.
“We lived off food stamps and powdered milk. I’ll never forget the chalky taste. I dreaded my cereal in the morning.”
Love, Pamela is the story of someone taking back their narrative. There are no ghost writers here. It begins with fourteen pages of free verse poetry. I knew this was going to be a unique memoir. Pamela writes on her own terms - always something to admire. Her poetry is weaved throughout and captures her warm personality and kind soul.The first half explores her childhood and early years on Vancouver Island. It was harrowing to read of the abuse and domestic violence she endured. Sadly, this would feature in many of her adult relationships too. It would have been easy for her life to take another direction. But it was inspiring to learn how she overcame these struggles and created a fulfilling life for herself. 
“I could not have survived my adult life without the strength I learned to muster early on.”
Pamela writes with honesty and vulnerability – particularly the first half. Certain sections gave me anxiety. There are many vivid characters too. People seemed fictional yet real. One moment I was smiling, the next feeling a sense of doom as another relationship turned sour. I found myself amazed at how well-read she is. Pamela’s passion for art, poetry and knowledge is infectious. It was interesting to read about the origins of her veganism and activism, and how she catapulted into fame. 
“No matter how I tried, the image was bigger than me and always won. My life took off without me.”
Pamela writes with self-awareness, particularly in regards to formative relationships. The second half, however, lacked some of this initial depth, and skimmed the surface. In her own words, she was stuck between protecting others and blurting out the truth. The book suffered because of this.A subtle insecurity began to manifest across the pages in these latter sections. It was like Pamela was caught up trying to convince readers of her intelligence, parenting skills, and ability to make the world a better place through her various causes. At times, it felt more resume than memoir in its delivery.Despite this, I was captivated by Pamela’s story and empowering way she poured herself into this memoir. It’s always good when you finish a book with greater respect and admiration for the author. Congrats on taking back your story, Pamela, and for doing so with grace and humility. 
“You can think your way out of living. This is when I learnedTo flip the script—When you change your thoughts,you change your life.”","“The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are” ~ Joseph CampbellLove, Pamela is the best memoir that I have read so far. Pamela Anderson did not hold back, and told us who she really is. I feel that Pamela’s image was misconstrued tremendously by the media and tabloids. Pamela is an intelligent, beautiful woman who finally told her story. This story is mesmerizing, heartbreaking, and often impulsive (as some of her actions were). In this memoir, we learn that Pamela is an animal rights activist (she loves animals and nature), she is involved in refugee organizations, she is an art lover who spends her time at various museums and is very familiar with artists who I’ve never even heard of. Pamela is also a book lover! Pamela has been an avid reader since she was a young girl, and this reading continues today. If she was on Goodreads, she would probably blow most of us away with her reviews and some of the works that she’s read. Pamela also grows her own garden with vegetables and fruits, and makes her own homemade vegan dishes. The greatest accomplishment is that she is/was a hands on mom to two wonderful boys through her marriage to Motley Crue drummer, Tommy Lee. Pamela talks about her “fairy tale” romance and wedding to Tommy Lee. While they were very much in love, the paparazzi followed them and provoked them constantly. Paparazzi vans were always parked outside of their house. In protecting Pamela from aggressive fans and paparazzi, Tommy would be triggered and become violent. His violence resulted in many fines and hefty settlements that they had to pay out to those who were assaulted by their aggravating behavior. We all know of the sex tapes between this couple that were stolen, and pretty much destroyed them as a couple. Pamela’s career was ruined, as was her life and the lives of their families and friends closest to them. Her two boys were also traumatized by these tapes, as they would be teased at school. To this day, Pamela still has not watched the tapes (and neither have I). Pamela goes on to add about her quick marriages to Kid Rock and Rick Salomon. She was always looking for the fairy tale romance that she had with Tommy Lee, but just never found it. She realized that apparently not all relationships work like that. In addition to the many talents that Pamela has - yes we all remember her from Baywatch, and she was in Playboy several times. Pamela is also a writer. Pamela has kept journals that she wrote in everyday since she was a young girl. Because of her ability to write, she wrote this memoir all by herself- with no ghostwriter or anything. This book is emotional, raw, and amazing!! I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to get a better understanding of Pamela Anderson, or what it’s like to be a human being in general. In addition to this memoir, she has a documentary out on Netflix. I have only watched half of the documentary so far, and I don’t think it’s as good as the book. This book obviously goes into more detail, so I do believe you will get more from this book than you would the documentary."
Odder,"Katherine Applegate, Charles Santoso (Illustrator)",4.23,"The delightfully charming cover may have drawn me in-- but it was the surprisingly creative free form prose that stole my heart from the first few pages.Admittedly, I judged the book by its cover, but in this case, the inside more than matched the charm of the outside. (Note—the inside illustrations were equally delightful).I love to be suprised-- plot twists I don't see coming, characters that change and grow, shallow plots lines that turn deep or dark-- these are just a few of the ways that this bookworm loves to be shocked out of her reading complacency.The cover screamed ""adorable children's book"" and then I read the first page-- caught off guard, I read a few more pages and then realized this kids book was anything but... 270 pages later I realized that Ms. Applegate (a talented but as yet unknown author to me-- my kids are in their 20s so it's been awhile since I trolled the library shelves for great books to read out loud) turned a children’s book into a story with universal themes.This is NOT just a children's book, but it would be a wonderful book to read out loud to kids in elementary school-- the older the better as I think some of the depth of the book's themes would be lost to the 4-7 year old set.This is an EVERYONE should read book. I'm in my 50s and yet I felt a wide range of emotions while reading Applegate's free form prose. Timeless themes-- loss, family, childhood (okay-- otterhood), hope, and joy spread across the pages like the kelp beds/patches found in the Pacific Ocean.I challenge you to read this book-- to yourself or to a loved one-- I promise you, it will give you all the ""feels."" I can't wait to order a few copies for Christmas presents... I can't think of a better book to give that hard to choose a gift for literary fan or young reader.(Reviewed 11/12/22)","I live in Morro Bay, CA. In our Bay are otters. A lot of visitors come here to see the otters. While my family was visiting this summer, they couldn’t wait to see the otters. For my daughter-in-law’s birthday this summer, we got her a cozy chair blanket with an otter picture on it. She lit up! There is something about an otter!This is an enjoyable story that animal lovers will appreciate. But…it is also an educational experience, too. Odder is written in free verse and inspired by true events, according to the author’s note at the back of the book. It also has lovely illustrations throughout by Charles Santoso that add to the story. Premise: Otter pup Odder is separated from her mom after a fierce storm. Fortunately, strange animals – humans – discover her and take her to a strange place, and restore her health. Eventually she goes back to the wild, has fun, makes friends – but after being badly injured by a shark bite, lands back with the humans again to be given a wonderful job of nurturing and raising other pups at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. There is much to love about the story – the feelings of adventure and impulsivity of the otters. The natural movements of a shark. The ways of the bay/ocean. The wonderful human intentions (to keep the otters healthy and/or happy in the wild). The importance of play. Messages of resilience, compassion and empathy.Some trigger moments for discussion with kids…Since the story is about orphaned pups and told from the viewpoint of one of them, (Odder) there will be some violence and scariness. A sense of fear, grief and uncertainty of being permanently separated from Mom is essential to the story – which may be difficult for kids to understand, even while kind humans provide a safety net. Other difficult parts to discuss with kids may involve when Odder is attacked by a shark and can no longer be in the wild, and another otter delivers a stillborn pup. Yet, even though…The story will have moments when it is centered on grief, loss and separation as pups lose their moms, moms lose their pups and friends lose each other – there will also, be in the background, a dedicated, caring group of scientists and volunteers working hard at keeping them safe. I strongly recommend that when readers are finished with the story, they read the Author’s note, to learn the amazing fictional backstories of these animals and their caretakers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, CA.She is also the author of The One and Only Ivan. My review is here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...","Just look at that face on the cover! Who can resist picking up this new release from Katherine Applegate? Not me. Written in verse, the true stories of otters at the Monterey Bay Aquarium are put into a cohesive story form. An Author's Notes gives details on the real-life otters who inspired the story of Odder. Such an inviting and informative book. Highly recommended!"
Alone,Megan E. Freeman,4.14,This wasn’t what I thought. I enjoyed some parts but when they put the kitten in a bag and bashed it dead against the truck door…. Nope. And the end? After all that time ….. Whatever! On to the next Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾,"Oh I really liked this one. A LOT. I could not put it down. The verse format made it easy to read and understand. I loved Maddie's story of survival. This would be a strong fit for those who loved Hatchet, I Survived series, Island of the Blue Dolphins, and for reluctant readers. I loved all the love for libraries/books/librarians! The reason this isn't a complete 5 stars was I would have loved to know why the evacuation happened, what the world was like before (we got some vague hints), and a bit more at the end... However this will not stop me from recommending this book to readers.","I am conflicted about this book. Is it a 3 stars read or a 4? I am sad that it wasn't a 5 stars read because the way it introduced itself in the first few chapters, I was confident this was going to be one of the best books I've read this year, but alas that didn't happen. Though, this is the most unique book I've read in the post apocalyptic genre. Imagine a story being told in free verse. One poem continues itself into another, building a detailed world of intrigue. Alone starts so strong with it’s dystopian descriptions. As a reader we truly feel how alone the character is, feel the changing of seasons with her, her need for survival and her lone adventures. However, there was no build up to a ""conflict"", there was as the character says herself no saving grace or plot development like the one we are accustomed to seeing in fiction...the character was truly alone and thats it. She is alone and we get to read about how alone she is in beautiful albeit same poetic ways.
I can still bathein the light of the moonas it rises hugeand orange in the eastand in theexpanse of constellationsthat spill across the skyon a clear, cold night.I can still marvelat a hawksoaring overheadwith a snake in its talons.I am still here
The lack of a plot tension left me with so many unanswered questions. How was she left alone? What was the political conspiracy that led to the abandonment of phones and homes? What happened to her parents? Who were the looters? There was so much potential to explore further into this world. It feels like a missed opportunity. While the end was emotional and heart-breaking, I feel unsatiated and need more to chew on. Overall, it is still a book I enjoyed reading!"
Held,Anne  Michaels,3.53,"Update: Winner of the Canadian Giller prize 2024 Shortlisted for the Booker prize 2024. It is so hard to review this book because I am not sure what to say about it. It’s not like I understood much, anyway. Ok, only half joking. Held might be quite tiny, but it is not an easy read. It requires quite a bit of concentration due to its structure. Also, patience. It took me a while to fully appreciate the writing and feel the atmosphere. I almost gave up at some point, thinking this is not for me. I might say that the novel is a collection of vignettes about the members of a family (and some well-known people such as Marie Curie). The novel starts in 1917, on a battlefield, where John lies after a blast. The beginning is full of musing such as : ”We know life is finite. Why should we believe death lasts forever” or “We can only think about the unknown in terms of the known”. The latter idea is also found in Thinking, Fast and Slow, a non-fiction book I recommend. I think the author started as a poet and it shows. So, we jump back and forth in time and we get to know some of what happened to John and his kin. All, enveloped in a poetic, semi-translucent haze. It seems to be a novel about death, loss, hope and …afterlife? Confusing at times but worth reading. I received this novel from Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing Plc in exchange to an honest review.","*Shortlisted for the 2024 Booker Prize*4.5⭐️Held by Anne Michaels opens on a battlefield in France in 1917, where John, a soldier, lies injured after a blast leaves him floating in and out of consciousness. His mind wanders as he reflects upon the significant moments and people in his life. We meet John again in 1930, running a photography business in Yorkshire with memories of battle and the devastation and loss that followed haunting his every thought, even finding their way into the pictures he takes. Though married to Helen and attempting to lead a normal life – not an easy journey for a man whose physical and emotional scars serve as a constant reminder of how much he last lost. We follow John's family and those connected to them through four generations following the tragedies, relationships and challenges they face and the choices they make as they find their way in the world and how the past and memories of the people they have loved and lost leave an indelible imprint on their lives.Written in elegant poetic prose, heartbreaking yet hopeful, blending fictional and real characters and significant moments from history spanning over a century, this novel is a memorable read. I’ll admit that it took a while to adjust to the fragmented non-linear nature of the narrative but when I began to connect the dots, I was immersed in this thought-provoking short novel that revolves around family, love, loss and fate, the invisible threads that connect people and the ties that bind the past, present and the future into a continuous saga of the human experience.If you read this short novel with a bit of patience, allowing for moments of pause and reflection, this will prove a rewarding experience. There were parts of this novel I read multiple times and would love to read again. This was my first time reading Anne Michaels and I shall definitely explore more of her work.Many thanks to Knopf, Pantheon, Vintage, and Anchor for the digital review copy via NetGalley.

Sometimes they stay deliberately absent, in order to prove themselves by returning. Sometimes they stay close and then leave in order to prove they were with us. Sometimes they bring a stag to a graveyard, a cardinal to a fence, a song on the wireless as soon as you turn it on. Sometimes they bring a snowfall.”Connect with me! ✏ Instagram ✏ My Blog ✏ The StoryGraph","Winner of the Canadian Giller Prize! 🏆🇨🇦📖Deservedly shortlisted for the 2024 Booker prize and having read the entire longlist, this is my favourite, and it is due a reread!This is a book I should not have listened to, but have read and savoured instead. The timelines and jumps are partly to blame, but the luminous, poetic language, while achingly beautiful, made it even harder to really fully digest and appreciate the novel as an audiobookTerror can spring from what is most ordinary, just as love canHeld reminded me a bit of Love and Other Thought Experiments, a Booker longlister of 2020, in the way this is an utterly original book that doesn’t concern itself overly with being fully understood on the first reading. In short chapters, scattered through the decades, we are offered stories of love and struggle. Starting of beautifully with a scene of soldier in WW I, we move through countries and places, find lovers related to the aforementioned soldier and his love Helena, who are driven away from each other by war and a need for justice. The interrelation between great history happening and interacting with small, particular lives across decades, seems a key topic of the author. Maybe most eloquently the approach the book takes is summed up in this quote about photography, an important part of the longest second chapter: If you hold the shutter open long enough everything moving disappearsThe language (while gorgeous) and structure of small chapters after the first two sections of the book, do make the struggle of the characters at times feel strangely ethereal. The 1920 section, focusing on a photography studio with potentially supernatural elements was interesting and rivalled the start of the book on the battlefield, but many of the chapters that follow have an almost impressionistic quality. The war nurse family section is also strong, reflecting on what it means to be driven onwards and doing the right thing even if all the odds are not in your favour. In a sense this is a modern expression of faith, which is one of the key themes of the novel. This chapter reminded me a bit of a section of the The Bone Clocks, where we also have a section focussed on a character going to a war zone, in this case Iraq.Even Marie Curie suddenly shows up near the end. Besides the relation to the reflections on faith versus science this felt slightly random for me, but again I see and appreciate the quality of this work and will be rereading it properly.Quotes:Perhaps the most important things we know can’t be proven Was an error deliberately made still an error?What we give cannot be taken from usFaith uses the mechanism of doubt to prove itself. It is absence that proofs what was once present. We can understand without proof he thought, we can prove without understanding.Everytime we disguise the truth we weaken our will How many parts can be taken from us before we are no longer ourselves The countless inner adjustments we make to be in the world, to accommodate our loneliness, our ache for reunionPerhaps we are only send exactly the proof we can believe.We can’t take money for a miracle What history is war writing in our bodies now?That the mechanism that disproves something is also the very mechanism of proof, and what we do not believe teaches us what we do believe. Faith is a mechanism just as love is, proving itself, once and for all and again and again, by its disappearance.Was rescue always a kind of love?But he did know with certainty that love was always a kind of rescue.Who can say what happens when we are remembered?"
"The Wren, the Wren",Anne Enright,3.53,"""it seems to me that women switch [...] from generation to generation: some get to tend and others to believe.""this is a sneaky, sticky book, one that can seem hard to read and eminently putdownable until at some point you realize the characters have become people, the structure impressive, and the strange vague writing poetic.the very beginning was good, but it became something i didn't like very much, and then it turned back again into something new and better.i don't think much about this book will stay with me, but that transformation will.bottom line: a pleasant surprise.3.5-----------------------tbr reviewapparently it's ""frowned upon"" to carry around a big sign that says I'M SMART, so i'll just read award winners","I’m impossibly tongue-tied trying to review this novel (not being coy). I can’t say enough but if I start, I will say too much. On the linear level (which this novel is not), it comprises three generations of traumatized women, all stemming from Phil McDaragh, a (fictional) minor Irish poet, major womanizer, and scoundrel. He is celebrated for his published poetry about birds and other wonders of the natural world—the beauty arising ironically from his derelict mind. I was charmed to learn that Ireland’s birds are so small that most will fit in the palm of your hand. I got all electric at the thought. Plus, googling up the birds upgraded the reading experience. Kingfisher, corncrake, Bali myna—and snap, look up the ones you think you knew, like lark, blackbird, finch. I can still hear the cheeps and chirps emanating from the pages. Enright is a magician, a word bird herself, she can fly in many directions simultaneously and have it all home in. Of a bullfinch—“…I saw the bird and I wanted to undo language and let him be.” This is after her expansive description that ends with, “Words only obscure him. Even the name, ‘bullfinch’, seems a form of littering, like a sticky label fixed to his feathers.” That’s a light example of Enright and her meticulous conjuring. It’s pointless to try and capture her wit; it’s like those palm-sized birds—they materialize and then whoosh! Gone. And a word on the plot. There isn’t one that quite coheres before the end, but I adored her juxtapositions. The uncommon combinations of words convey the story better than a boilerplate or sweeping plot could do. Little seeds are planted at intervals, (such as, Phil’s granddaughter, Nell, who never met him, but is abused by his presence--really, his absent presence). Enright drops quiet little clues, and later she irrigates them with her spellbinding word serum. The plot is unlatched, like a basement bulkhead banging its bolt outside to the ground, with a winding time frame from above. Characters evolve as the narrative closes. Don’t read for plot, read it for the irresistible voice, the cast, the prose. I fell in love with how Enright bends language. She is as tender as she is pointed.How quickly structure, concision, and shaded depth contributed, and distracted me out of my comfort zone. Fiction can bring us fast into the moment, with immediate effect. Some of us readers may be disgusted or alienated by the things these characters do. Phil, whose wife is dying of cancer--and in fact she is propped up on pillows to “…facilitate drainage,” is a real dirtbag. He accuses his dying wife of stealing or concealing his nonsense wristwatch. Meantime, he messes up the bedsheets and blankets searching for the thing around her, and then quickly leaves. After that horrifying scene, I felt dread. Sadly (sadly?) I was also urged to continue. I had to know the outcome. There were tragic scenes that repelled me, you’ll have to read them in context. “I realized that every stupid, small thing I said that first night we got together had landed somewhere wrong in him, and it rose up now as a taunt.”TWTW tells a familiar story in the most singular way. The genesis of the trauma still lingers and threatens to dismantle all ongoing primary relationships. Abject agony is recognizable in any form, the hollow bottom of it, the things her characters witness in their past. Enright’s narrative is so active, so much happens the moment that you read it that you are astonished over and over. “The temper was always there, waiting for either one of them. When Imelda hit Carmel, it reorganized the pain.“And it was a kind of revelation, too. Afterwards, the world was very bright.”Shivered at times while reading. 5 weighty stars! The birdsong made me want to read the whole novel over again. A huge thank you to Norton for sending me an ARC for reviewPS (written days later, after reading other people's fine reviews)--I did not think of Sally Rooney (as likely others did) while reading. But it makes sense that they would be compared. Two compelling female authors who make wry observations of and about the people in their lives.","**Shortlisted for the 2024 Women's Prize for Fiction**“The connection between us is more than a strand of DNA, it is a rope thrown from the past, a fat twisted rope, full of blood.”As the novel begins, we meet twenty-two-year-old Nell, who seeks to carve out a life for herself as a writer. Her need to be independent prompts her to move out of her mother’s home despite the financial struggles and loneliness it might entail. Nell’s relationship with her mother is complicated. Carmel, the daughter of Irish poet Phil McDaragh, carries the scars of a troubled childhood. Her father abandoned his family – Carmel, her sister and their terminally ill mother for greener pastures but left them with a legacy of debt and emotional trauma. Nell never met her grandfather but has been exposed to his work and is curious to know more about him. As the narrative progresses, we follow Nell as embarks on a deeply personal journey of self-awareness and healing, dealing with her frustration with her work and her relationship with Felim, who is controlling and abusive. We also follow Carmel’s story and are given a glimpse into how her experiences have taken a toll on her personal relationships and contributed to her inability to connect with her daughter, whom she loves dearly. The Wren, the Wren by Anne Enright is an intense novel that explores the impact of trauma and the deep scars that are passed down through generations of a family. Anne Enright does a remarkable job of portraying the complex mother-daughter dynamic between Nell and Carmen. Multiple perspectives (Nell, Carmel and a brief segment from the PoV of Phil), allow us to explore the motivations, expectations and trauma experienced by the main characters which not only impacts their relationships but also influences their worldview and life choices. Personally, I found Carmel’s perspective the most compelling. The narrative is a tad disjointed and the structure is non-linear, which renders the story somewhat difficult to follow. I loved the poetry interspersed throughout the narrative and thought the sentiments conveyed through those verses beautifully carried the story forward. Despite the lack of cohesiveness throughout the course of the narrative, the author has done a commendable job of weaving the three main threads of the story together into a satisfying ending. I should mention that I did find one particularly descriptive scene of animal cruelty disturbing. Many thanks to W.W. Norton and Company and NetGalley for the digital review copy.

Perfect Victims and the Politics of Appeal,Mohammed El-Kurd,4.89,"I'll sound like a broken record, but I don't think we are yet capable of understanding the psychiatric/psychological impact on carrying out our lives in the middle of a genocide. There's the relentless images coming out of Gaza of lifeless bodies, unrecognizable piles of remains, utter destruction, etc. But there's also a linguistic component that I've been drawn to. How we consume media, what preconditions we accept without interrogation, who holds the power to shape narratives. These are the questions that Mohammed relentlessly pursues. This is not a book to make you feel good or coddle your feelings and comfort in how you currently see the world. It's meant to push you to question yourself and learn how to question others.","Thoughtful, powerful, and direct writing about resisting anti-Palestinian racism. Mohammed El-Kurd focuses on dismantling respectability politics and highlighting the ways pro-Palestinian organizers, activists, and advocates shouldn’t have to be conciliatory or demure in their fight for justice. Really liked his ideas about uplifting Palestinian men and the courage and strength of sharing one’s unfiltered story, in addition to his broader arguments about resisting tone-policing. As a slight side note, I’m thinking of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts graduate student in Psychology with a student visa who was recently detained by ICE as punishment for her pro-Palestine views… what an awful fascist time in the U.S. The suppression is all part of the Zionist anti-Palestine agenda so I’m grateful for books like these which keep the dialogue going.",Everyone go buy or borrow this book and read it RIGHT NOW!!!!
Poeta chileno,Alejandro Zambra,4.38,"Cálido y entretenido. Un libro compañero, como bien lo describe mi librero favorito. Y me encanta que sea tan chilenísimo con la chucha, que buena manera de acercar la poesía a una novela. Sin duda es una protagonista genial, te deja con ganas de leer toda la poesía chilena y más. Y tiene una fiesta de poetas que es muy divertida. Gran libro, muy recomendado.","Irrepressible desires of youth are a driving force of poetry…She loved music, she’d been an amateur photographer ever since she was little, and she was always reading some novel or other, but she thought poetry was childish and overblown. Gonzalo, however, like almost everyone, associated poetry with love. He had not won Carla over with poems, but he had fallen in love with her and with poetry almost simultaneously, and it was hard for him to separate them.Soon enough Carla discards Gonzalo and from his suffering, his first poems are born…However, poets are also obliged to live their ordinary, unpoetic lives…Nine years elapsed and when Gonzalo accidentally again meets Carla, who by now has become a single mother, they start living together… Gonzalo happily raises his stepson and continues to write poems…He thought they weren’t bad, or rather that it would be hard to decide if they were good or bad, which meant they were more good than bad. He also thought they weren’t bad, but they were unnecessary. It didn’t seem like the world needed those poems. He wanted to write the poems no one had written before, but at that moment he thought no one had written these particular poems because they weren’t worth writing.But one fine day Gonzalo wins a government grant to finance a doctorate in New York so he is compelled to exit the stage… Six years went by… And although different water flows in the river now, history’s repeating… The eighteen-year-old stepson goes into poetry…Vicente read a couple more poems by Jorge Teillier, which Carla also liked, though she was distracted by the thought that poetry was like an illness her son had contracted, an illness associated with the little room, an illness that of course she preferred to his previous illness of sadness, but one that in any case worried her.Poetry is atavism… Poetry is magnetic… Poetry entices… Poetry persists…Then Gonzalo enters the stage once again…

Poetic thought moves in unpredictable ways.","Voy a comenzar el comentario a esta novela que con tanto humor ha escrito Zambra —empezando por ese Chile tan abundantemente poblado de poetas como quiltros recorren las calles de todas sus ciudades y pueblos— con una de esas confesiones tan al estilo de los homófobos o los racistas, algo así como que no tengo nada en contra de los poetas, de hecho tengo un amigo poeta, pero, uuuuffff, no soporto la poesía, o no la entiendo o me aburre o todo a la vez. No me juzguen, al menos no soy como la zorra que desprecia las uvas que no puede alcanzar, algo que parece que no pueden decir los poetas chilenos protagonistas de este relato que tanto desprecian a la novela y a los novelistas. 
“Supongo que para escribir una novela hay que estar mucho rato sentado, no sé si aguantaría” 
Una curiosa humorada porque es desde la novela que Zambra, también poeta, homenajea a los poetas, una novela que en su parte principal se cuentan las vidas de unas personas muy normalitas, desde sus primeros calores adolescentes, sus amores, la convivencia, los hijos que llegan y los que no, propios o ajenos, el profundo amor que se les tiene, la responsabilidad que con ellos se contrae, el inicio de las dudas sobre el amor que dan, sobre el amor que reciben, hasta los nuevos caminos que aparecen o se desea recorrer, las despedidas, los abandonos, los rechazos, en fin, nada muy llamativo, nada especial —“el registro casual de la vida cotidiana” —, y todo contado, como en la propia novela se dice, con “un tono ligero, contundente, inesperadamente personal… como alguien que piensa en voz alta”. Vamos, como dando la razón a los poetas en su desapego de la forma narrativa en la que alrededor de unas pocas páginas realmente literarias se acumulan grandes montones de paja. 
 “Eso pensaba Pound… En una carta a William Carlos Williams dice qué él solo escribe las partes buenas de las novelas. Y que todo lo demás, las cuatrocientas páginas restantes, son puro relleno y aburrimiento” 
Pues yo tengo que decir que he disfrutado de cada brizna de paja de esta novela. ¿Por qué? Ni la menor idea. Solo puedo decir que ha sido como volver a leer a Bolaño, algo misterioso que no se puede explicar pero que te engancha, aunque muchas veces me quede perplejo ante el sentido que puedan tener todas esas páginas y páginas de anécdotas o escenas que no sé muy bien cómo encajar en la novela ni encontrar un para qué satisfactorio. Como Bolaño, Zambra nos transmite con una inmensa ternura repleta de humor y hasta de una mala leche cómplice todo el cariño que le despiertan sus personajes en particular y los poetas en general, su forma de ser y de existir, como si fueran palafitos, esas casas con patas que pueden cambiar de terreno sin modificar su identidad, sin ni siquiera tener que vaciar los cajones, quizás nada más que descolgar algún cuadro que se pudiera caer, pero que necesitan clavarse bien en la tierra para volver a su ser. Da igual que tengan tendencia a mirar las tetas de su bella entrevistadora, lo que hacen tanto ellos como ellas, da igual su problema de halitosis, da igual la cantidad de huevás en las que creen, el caso es que:
 “Es un mundo mejor … más genuino. Menos fome. Menos triste… creen en el talento, tal vez creen demasiado en el talento. En la comunidad. No sé, son más libres, menos cuicos. Se mezclan más…menos falsos que la vida corriente de quienes aceptan las reglas y bajan la cabeza. Por supuesto que hay oportunismo y violencia, pero también verdadera pasión y heroísmo y fidelidad a los sueños.” 
En la novela se llega a decir que si escribiste un libro de Poesía ya eres poeta para siempre, “estás cagado”, pero yo creo que hay muchísimos más poetas que no han publicado nunca ni han llegado a planteárselo, y aun así son pocos, siempre serán pocos, hasta en Chile, bicampeona mundial de poesía, lo son."
Louder Than Hunger,John Schu,4.45,"Oh wow....I wish I had the words to describe the experience that is this book. I highly recommend checking out content warnings before diving into this. CW: representation of disordered eating, depression, OCD, bullying.Honestly, I've been putting off reading this book for a while. Although I haven't personally grabbled with disordered eating, I knew that the content would be raw and heavy.What Worked: While I knew that Schu was writing from his own experience, there was still a level of rawness that was unexpected. I haven't read many youth related titles that explore disordered eating from the perspective of a teen boy. The pain associated with bullying and the shattered sense of self from his perspective was eye opening. And quite frankly, I believe that it will be eye-opening for a number of readers. While there were significant portions of the book that were dark and heavy, Schu does include lighter moments giving Jake the opportunity to connect with others. His process of recovery definitely resonated with me the most. It wasn't perfect. There are depictions of relapses that feel overwhelmingly real and raw, but were handled with care in way that informed the reader, but didn't exploit the trauma of Jake and the other characters. Overall, this was a powerful read. I'm always fascinated by kidlit books that tackle difficult topics and this was no different.","“When will you give yourself permission to take up space?” John Schu was one of the first educators I followed and learned from in the early days of Twitter. His enthusiasm and love for books was and is infectious. When he became a picture book author, I was elated for him. Both picture books (THIS IS A SCHOOL and THIS IS A STORY) follow that same joyful enthusiasm I experience whenever I am in John’s presence, whether digitally or IRL. But when I found out he wrote a middle grade novel in verse based on his own experience as a teenager with an eating disorder, my heart broke for him. And it continued to break as I read this book. But just as Erin Entrada Kelly says in her blurb for this book, “He broke my heart and stitched it back together again.” That is what this book did for me too. And while the main character of Jake loves Emily Dickinson and frequently quotes the poem “Hope is the thing with feathers,” author Natalie Lloyd says about LOUDER THAN HUNGER, “Sometimes hope comes along and it’s book-shaped.” John Schu has managed to write one of those rare books that can bridge the middle grade/YA divide, and while it is certainly about a really difficult topic that could be triggering for some readers, John writes with such gentleness and care for his readers that I hope was healing for his inner child. If you teach upper elementary, middle or high school, LOUDER THAN HUNGER is a book that belongs on your bookshelf. Publishes March 2024.","If I could give this book one million stars, I would."
The Words We Keep,Erin  Stewart,4.33,"mental illness is not pretty. its exhausting and raw and i appreciate how this book doesnt romanticise it, which sometimes happens in YA fiction. i think anyone who has ever felt the pressure to be perfect or has fears of letting other people down will be able to connect and relate with lily. i think her journey is one that needs to be told, as there are so many teens who are on the same path and will find solidarity in her struggles. and although i am personally beyond this stage of life, i feel like a lot of readers will find this emotionally impactful.side note - i would advise reader discretion when picking this up as there is a lot of real, yet potentially triggering, content. ↠ 3.5 stars","This book truly affected me more than I thought! It literally ripped my heart apart!  The slow burn start and getting stuck inside struggling heroine’s head shouldn’t make you stop reading this meaningful and heart wrenching story because its pace gets picked up after the introductions to the characters’ entire predicaments, struggles, suffers, sadnesses, challenges.And it’s truly worth to keep going! Here’s a quick summary of the plot:  I hear Lily’s pain completely: she pushes herself too hard to be the exemplary daughter after her sister’s bipolar disorder shakes the entire family to the core. She acts like everything is all right as she falls into pieces, fighting with her own inner demons. She’s straight A student, track-star, golden child. When she becomes partners with Micah for English project, she realizes she has found the only person who can truly understand what she’s been through because Micah also spent time at the same center her sister was sent. He still deals with his mental health issues, trying to get healed as school bullies are insistent to give him a hard time. This book is thought provoking, heartfelt, realistic and definitely educational to learn and understand more about the people who are brave enough to fight against mental health issues.

The Cat Who Taught Zen,James Norbury,4.31,"This is one of those books that seems super cool at the beginning of a journey into Zen, and one that probably seems equally cool when you are nearing 10 or 20 years of experience with it. The middle 70% of the way may have you wanting to toss this away, calling it a scam in hardcover format, and running off to find some journal article that has attempted to find Zen in a 20-item questionnaire with Likert scales. Which is ironic. I am not implying that I have even close to 2-3 years of experience with practicing, but the mode of thought is familiar to me. I can see why this would be very useful for many folks, and I will be sure to recommend it accordingly.Many gold nuggets in this one:- The Cat nodded and smiled.‘Thank you,’ said the Cub.‘I didn’t do anything,’ said the Cat.‘You listened,’ said the Cub, ‘and that made all the difference.’- ‘I once heard someone say, it was not the journey or the destination that mattered most, but the company.’- The obstacle IS the path.","4.25/5 Although I enjoyed reading this book outloud alongside my husband, we both agreed that ending feels kind of ""stretched out"" and that some lines are a bit ""try hard to sound smart"". We did, however, enjoy beautiful illustrations and profound quotes. I expect we will revisit this book soon enough to seek some comfort and refuge.🐱🫶🏻Beautiful book to contemplate and share with someone.♥️","I’ve learned that what we want is seldom what we need, and what we need is almost never what we want”The Cat Who Taught Zen attempts to “approach zen in a practical way by taking some of it’s ideas and stories and making them more accessible and useful on a day to day level.” This is done by the journey of The Cat and the animals he meets along the way. These encounters are told through traditional zen stories, “which have been used for hundreds of years to point towards ideas without literally explaining them”.The animal encounters/stories are illustrated by the author using multiple traditional drawing styles including one called sumi-e which was used in East Asia centuries ago. The drawings and the messages are the heart of this book.On the path towards understanding, the the cat encounters a kitten who asks where his friends are. The cat replies that his is a solo journey and he doesn’t need friends. I loved the kitten's response:“But friends are like magic” ‘When you share something good with a friend, you somehow get more than if you kept it to yourself’ ‘And if something isn’t right, just telling your friend can make it seem better, even though they might not know how to fix it’.The Cat Who Taught Zen is a book you can pick up and read multiple times and find something new each time you read it, or just have it be a comfort for what you might need in this moment. From the story of the kitten and the dragon:‘Spend time in silence,appreciate nature,be mindful and seek peace’"
Where the Sidewalk Ends,Shel Silverstein,4.34,His parents did well naming him Shel.He never did care to conform.What would compel a guy to rebelIf everyone knew him as Norm?,"“I will not play at tug o' war.I'd rather play at hug o' war,Where everyone hugsInstead of tugs,Where everyone gigglesAnd rolls on the rug,Where everyone kisses,And everyone grins,And everyone cuddles,And everyone wins.”","Book Review

4+ of 5 stars to Where the Sidewalk Ends, a collection of poetry published in 1974 by Shel Silverstein. What a wonderful book to read with children at any age; that is, both any age for the reader and the children! I first read this book when I was about 10-years-old, and then again in college. From the brilliant characters to the alliteration and rhyme, to the memorable lines and funny situations, it's one of those books where you will find something new each time you read it.I cannot imagine being this creative. I can dream up stories about real people and situations and have written several, but to have an imagination where animals and things can talk, have emotions, interact in peculiar ways... to find the words to compare and contrast... to describe and draw precious creations... is true talent. I admire Silverstein's massive fantasy world of freedom. He was so unconstrained in his ability to develop a world with just enough charm and beauty to win us all over. It's a book all about perception, but without taking the didactic and pedantic approach.Children see things differently than adults. Adults have limits. Children have experiences. But what happens on the other side... where something is too far to see, or too close to imagine? Who lives in the crack between cement blocks? The world of freedom does... and that's where Silverstein wants us to go, where we are all equal, without preconceived notions... to be able to explore as if we are seeing something for the first time... and connecting with everyone around us. That's how to motivate readers with this book... children learning to see more than what they actually see.I could go on and on... but I'll stop. It's just a wonderful way to learn. FYI - Wrote this review ~2017 from memory as I want to have a review for everything I remember reading. If I messed it up, let me know! LOL :)

The Princess Saves Herself in This One,Amanda Lovelace,3.82,"Okay. Yeah. That was....well, not my favorite ever thing. I feel like I just read my middle school AIM away messages or 200 pages of emo Myspace updates. I need to go listen to some Dashboard Confessional STAT.I love the idea. I love the sentiments and the lessons, and CERTAINLY the feminist ideas at work here. If I saw any of the platitudes expressed in the ""you"" section on Tumblr, I'd happily reblog them. I definitely appreciate the raw emotions that very clearly went into the writing of them, and how personal the author was willing to get about her life. BUT. Um. Ummmmmmmmm. What the fuck.But that...well. That's just not the kind of poetry I respond to. I find minimalist poetry EXTREMELY hit or miss, and when I (VERY RARELY) read poetry, it's usual the lusher, more ornate kind--or at least the more visually creative. Because this...I mean, there's nothing new here. It's generic Tumblr platitudes. It's emo angst that should be emblazoned over a picture of a sad girl on the beach and put on Pinterest. It's beyond basic metaphors and cliche imagery about hearts and stars and oceans. It'shitting enterafter nearlye v e r y w o r dandmakingitfeeldeep.To me that's just a waste of trees, but hey, to each their own.Again, i APPRECIATE the raw angst here, but it's pretty clunky. There's no subtlety or nuance, which is why it makes me think of 13 year old me, just scribbling out PURE FEELINGS to the page because it was the only person who'd listen and all the feelings FELT SO NEW. Which, I mean, thank you for the nostalgia, if that's what was intended, but as a book of POETRY--sophisticated poetry for the modern feminist--it's a hard pass. I mean, this book of poetry even touched on things that are very personal to me, like grief, but I got zero feels. It was all so distant and buried in cliches. Examples: everyone i love leaves.I...what? What Peyton Sawyer bullshit is this? That's the whole poem??

Leaves of Grass,Walt Whitman,4.12,"Don't pay attention to me, I'm currently high on poetry.",""" I am the poet of the bodyAnd I am the poet of the soul. ""I do not know how to review poetry or what to look for when I am reading it. All I can say is whether I liked it or not. I really, really liked this. Although it was written in 1855, the free verse felt fresh and actual. It was an ode to nature, love, sex and the self. I was recommended the 1855 version because it has some interesting punctuation and I thought it complemented the text well.

Ariel,Sylvia Plath,4.19,"Inspired by Paul Legault's brilliant idea of translating Emily Dickinson's poems into English, I thought immediately - I have to steal that idea.

I have, of course, tried my utmost to perform this task with tact, discretion and good taste.ARIEL TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISHELM.Look, let's get this straight. I am a tree, you are a woman. We can never be together, not in the way you'd like, anyway. Plus, you're kind of irritating.THE RABBIT CATCHERI went out with this guy once and then I found out he liked to catch rabbits. So he was toast. I should have dimed the bastard.BERCK-PLAGEI went on holiday. Every single person in the whole hotel was talking about me behind my back. I don't like bikinis. Don't even get me started on nude beaches.THE OTHERI have something dead in my handbag. Tee hee. Also, I scratched myself and made myself bleed. I don't really recommend marriage.A BIRTHDAY PRESENTI got a present. But I was thinking that if I unwrapped it, it would bite my face off. So I didn't. Hah.THE BEE MEETINGI thought I'd like to join in village life and get involved with local societies and all that. So I went to the bee keepers' meeting. It was like something out of Alfred Hitchcock. I liked it.STINGSNow I'm a real bee keeper. I get blase about stings. It's like a metaphor.THE SWARMBees are kind of like Nazis. Or the French. I can't decide.WINTERINGCountry life can suck. I wish I was a bee. No, I don't really. That would be silly. I think it would be silly. Maybe it wouldn't be silly.A SECRETMen are like big babies that drink beer and want you to wear high class lingerie. Okay, that's not much of a secret.THE APPLICANTI got this job as a temp. So I was filing and I knew I could destroy them if I chose, just like that, but I didn't choose to that day.DADDYWhen I was little and my dad used to dress up in his SS uniform I used to think he looked so smart and handsome. Of course, later, the penny dropped.LESBOSYou really shouldn't have taken the kittens and given them to the neighbours without a by-your-leave.

Night Sky with Exit Wounds,Ocean Vuong,4.18,"The fact that Ocean Vuong can lay me out and then undo me with his words alone is entirely too much power for one poet. I've read and re-read the poems in this collection so many times there are lines I can recall clear as day, and each time, I am incapacitated by them anew. Vuong writes like his heart is hanging wide open on its hinges. His sincerity is so disarming, and the way he hammers pain (both personal and historical) out of language is nothing short of extraordinary. This is the kind of poetry collection that settles into you and becomes like breathing. Brilliant, gorgeous, heart-deep, and utterly unforgettable.","This is a lovely lovely book of poems. Nearly every poem ended in a way that left me saying ""mmmmm"" with pleasure or admiration or the quiet of feeling stunned by such beautiful words.","The most beautiful part of your bodyis where it's headed, & rememberloneliness is still time spentwith the world.To read Ocean Vuong's 
Night Sky with Exit Wounds
 is to be dazzled by gorgeous lyricism. I picked this up as part of my exploration of contemporary poetry I have been experimenting with over the last several weeks. It's amazing the breadth of talent that exists in this genre.I realized after reading the first few sentences of Vuong's first poem just how talented he is. It certainly explains why this book won the 2016 Whiting Award and the 2017 T.S. Eliot Prize, because some of his stanzas simply took my breath away.Use it to prove how the starswere always what we knewthey were the exit woundsof everymisfired word.Vuong spent the first two years of his life living in a refugee camp, and he never knew his father. This sense of emptiness is palpable through many of the 35 poems in this collection, as Vuong imagines reasons why his father wasn't part of his life. He imagines his father meeting violent or tragic, accidental ends, or even being imprisoned. In several poems, he imagines encounters with his father at various stages of his life.Like any good son, I pull my father outof the water, drag him by his hairthrough white sand, his knuckles carving a trailthe waves rush in to erase.Some of the poems touch on mythological themes, some touch on more realistic, violent ones, exploring the experience of Vietnamese refugees. One poem, ""Aubade with Burning City,"" is based on the fact that Armed Forces Radio played the song ""White Christmas"" as a code to begin Operation Frequent Wind, the ultimate evacuation of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees by helicopter during the fall of Saigon in 1975. The poem juxtaposes verse with lyric fragments from the song, to beautiful effect.The more poetry I've been reading, the more I realize that just as I prefer ""traditional"" short stories over those which take more experimental forms and narratives, I feel the same way about poetry. At times, Vuong experiments with form, language, even writes a poem using footnotes, and those poems didn't work for me. In the end, however, 
Night Sky with Exit Wounds
 is at times contemplative, fiery, even erotic. Vuong's power lies in his words, and the emotions he conveys through them. While poetry doesn't get the type of recognition fiction and other genres get, Vuong definitely deserves to be heralded as an artist for our time.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."

The show isn’t historically accurate (which is what helps it so shine so brightly, in my opinion) but it is an excellent introduction to her poems. “Fame is a bee,” among others, deals with the complexity of fame—a theme I seem to be addicted to in my own work as well."
A Light in the Attic,Shel Silverstein,4.36,"Every child eventually discovers the perverted old man who wrote songs for Johnny Cash, did illustrations for Playboy, appeared on the Dr. Demento show numerous times, and managed to get a few books published along the way. For some reason, parents never seem to think this creepy old guy who was so fond of children was in any way ""disturbing,"" something I'm continually impressed with in the ""ban now, ask questions later"" climate of modern culture. If there are people who don't like Shel Silverstein, I don't want to meet them. Or, more to the point, you shouldn't meet them if that is an option. Children need to experience this kind of creepy / weird / funny / sad stuff, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of having a conduit through which they can make sense of most of the rest of the world. Knowing that Shel sees things this way, too, makes it all easier to take, and makes your own oddness that much more tolerable. We, as humans, need to come to terms with inexplicable and unfathomable in the world, and it wasn't until Shel that we began to realize that the only way to gently help our children do just that, is to let a perverted old weirdo with a large stack of Playboys in his basement lead the way.","“Do a loony-goony dance 'Cross the kitchen floor, Put something silly in the world That ain't been there before.”",I read this with my son when he was little many times and have many happy memories!
Howl and Other Poems,"Allen Ginsberg, William Carlos Williams (Introduction)",4.13,if only i had my very own jess to put some notes in the margins for me,"Easy to overestimate Allen Ginsberg. Easy to underestimate him too.There are—if you leave out the political, religious and major historical figures—only about two dozen or so 20th century cultural icons, and Ginsberg is one of them—right up there with Einstein, Bogart, James Dean, and Marilyn Monroe. In the 60's, his face was ubiquitous, and the Ginsberg poster you picked out for yourself showed the kind of Ginsberg you aspired to be: Ginsberg in Uncle Sam hat, naked Ginsberg embracing naked Peter Orlovsky, psychedelic “Moses” Ginsberg holding up two stone tablets of the Law of “Who to be Kind to,” or Ginsberg protesting in the snow and wearing a big sign that says “Pot is Fun.” He was a hipster, a hedonist and a holy man, standing up for every form of free expression you could imagine, smiling from the walls of every coffeehouse, every bookstore, every other two room apartment that you knew. And it was hard to get past all those posters and just sit down and read the poetry.But if you got past all that, it was still hard to separate the political from the poetic. His most famous poem ""Howl"" was the center of a notorious free speech fight, and many of the later poems, from “America” to “Wichita Vortex Sutra” and beyond, could not be fully understood without some knowledge of the protest movements of the time. However, if you did actually sit down and read some of his poetry--away from the context, away from the intoxicating counter-cultural atmosphere--you might begin to suspect that Ginsberg the Poetry Icon was superior to Irwin Allen Ginsberg from Newark, New Jersey, the guy who actually sat down and wrote what is often—frankly--mediocre verse.Part of the problem stems from the length of Ginsberg's free verse line: it is indeed a very long line, habitually a few beats longer than a dactylic hexameter. (Even when he breaks a line into W.C.Williams “triads,” it still seems to be long.) Most poets who choose such a line as their vehicle (Kit Smart, Martin Tupper, Whitman, Fearing, Jeffers, Ginsberg) come off sounding biblical and orotund in long passages which lack lyricism and are often indistinguishable from mediocre prose. (C.K. Williams--perhaps because of his narrative drive--is the notable exception here). When you add to this the fact that Ginsberg delights in improvisation, and once embraced as his model the “no revisions necessary” Kerouac prose style, it is little wonder that many of his lines fail to sing.But, as I said, it is easy to underestimate him too, particularly if we “just sit down and read” his poetry, divorcing it from the world of cultural influences and public performance that he loved. For example, if you sit down to read “Howl,” and it seems too ponderous, too much like the prophet Jeremiah wailing for all the pitiful beatnik dead, just stop for a minute and go download some early 50's jazz--Herbie Nichols maybe, or Lee Konitz or the MJQ—and play it quietly in the background while you stand up and recite the poem aloud to yourself—swaying a little, perhaps even snapping your fingers. You may begin to discover unexpected deposits of gentle humor, the occasional pocket of sick humor, and even a little slapstick from time to time, and also sense--knitting the four movements of this magnificent performance piece together—an overarching, self-conscious hipster irony which refuses for even one second to take Ginsberg the Prophet or Ginsberg the Poetry Icon completely seriously.As you probably can tell, I love “Howl.” I think it is a masterwork of American poetry, unique and irreplaceable. This collections also contains four shorter pieces almost as good: ”A Supermarket in California” (an encounter with Walt Whitman, who is “eyeing the grocery boys”), ”America” (a love letter to the USA and a protest poem at the same time, ending with the memorable line, “America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel""), “Sunflower Sutra” (a conversation with Kerouac in Frisco about a gray dead sunflower which ends with a “sermon” proclaiming that “we are all beautiful golden sunflowers inside”), and “In the Baggage Room at Greyhound” (Irwin Allen Ginsberg's farewell to a job he obviously hated).These five poems make up only 70% of this small 50 page collection, and the rest of the poems included here I don't think are worth reading at all. (But then I didn't experiment with jazz in the background. So I just might be underestimating Ginsberg once again.)","Allen Ginsberg, a sad and lonely man, wrote this to impress Kerouac, another sad and lonely man. Over the years, a lot of sad and lonely people haven't gotten over the how much that first fucking line resonates with them. The whole best minds/generation/destroyed/madness line.Ten years ago, this was a 5-star poem. Ten years from now, it will be a 3-star poem. That's just called growing up, folks."
The Odyssey,"Homer, Robert Fagles (Translator), Bernard Knox (Editor)",3.82,"When you stop and think about it, much of classic literature is about how getting on a boat is a bad idea. This book is a litany on why boating is a bad idea. You can say it at least worked out for Odysseus but did it? Did it really? If that dude isn’t haunted by the screams of his crew forever it’s just because the horrors of having been on a boat are overriding it. The whole war could have been avoided if Helen had just stayed off one boat. So if you ever find yourself as a character in a novel (you’ll know by the sweet smell of freshly printed pages on the breeze) I beg you DO NOT GET ON A BOAT. You won’t get that ‘one fine day…’ on a boat Gatsby is hoping for in the famous line about the futility of boats (among other things). Look at Moby Dick—bet the crew of the Pequad were all wishing they stayed on land right before the whale drowned all their asses. You know what isn’t trying to drown you? Land. Ahab might have been a cool baker or candlestick maker but boats led him astray. More like Moby DEAD amirite? The danger of literary boats is real, my friends, Poe’s only novel was about just that. Heart of Darkness? More like Boats are the Heart of the Problem. Look what happened to that old man in the sea, almost starved! And theres The Open Boat by Stephen Crane to remind you the sea is more of an open grave. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was like but what if we go UNDER the water surely that’ll work out great? Wrong. Jim Hawkins and Robinson Curuso could have avoided all sorts of trouble if they stayed off boats. That movie with Jeff Bridges and his school boat was all fun and games until Ryan Phillippe ended up super dead. And watch out for Theseus’ ship, we don’t know if it even counts as the same ship! Boats are tricky like that. Ask the orcas, they know what’s up.Now in sci fi, spaceships are basically just space boats. And look what happened to Paul Atreides when he took that space boat to Arrakis: literally fucking space genocide. Nobody wants that. Hell, the Death Star is just a really really big genocide boat and that ended poorly for everyone. 2001 A Space Odyssey has a space boat out for murder and blaming the crew. So watch out for boats, ye land lubbers. Leave the pirating to me.","""Okay, so here's what happened. I went out after work with the guys, we went to a perfectly nice bar, this chick was hitting on me but I totally brushed her off. Anyway we ended up getting pretty wrecked, and we might have smoked something in the bathroom, I'm not totally clear on that part, and then this gigantic one-eyed bouncer kicked us out so we somehow ended up at a strip club. The guys were total pigs but not me, seriously, that's not glitter on my neck. And then we totally drove right by these hookers without even stopping and here I am! Only a little bit late! By the way, I crashed the car and six of the guys are in jail. Ask for Officer Scylla.""Eh...Homer's right. Odysseus' version is better.P.S. Do not try this story at home unless, when you get there, you're still capable of shooting your arrow into a narrow aperture.Fagles' translation is excellent - the new standard - and Bernard Knox's enormous introduction is the best Homeric essay I've ever read.A good companion read is Hal Roth's We Followed Odysseus - maybe not the most eloquent of books, but he retraces Odysseus's voyage (as best he can) in his sailboat, which is a pretty rad idea. I recreated his route as a Google map here, with notes on each of the stops. I also wrote summaries of each book of the Odyssey for a book club discussion; I've pasted them in the comments thread below, if you're interested.",Quite possibly one of my favourite books!It was this novel that ignited my love for Greek and Roman mythology and antiquity - leading me to choose a degree in Classical Civilisations.I always look back on The Odyssey with fondness - I love all the monsters he faces and the gods who involve themselves with Odysseus' trials as he makes his way home after the Trojan War.LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Crush,"Richard Siken, Louise Glück (Foreword)",4.34,"siken captures the Gay Longing in such a perfect, powerful way & suddenly you feel your heart taking root in your bodyalso it's cool how you can just know that a person is straight™ if they claim they 1) don't understand why blood & death are such prominent themes in these poems and/or 2) didn't find any deeper meaning in them","I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me after I read this. There's a thread of a story here, but it's abstract and shadowed. Almost a ghost of a story. What's left are the raw emotions of the actual experience, which is what great poetry is: distilling the massive events that make up a life until there's nothing left but the urgent parts, the ones that carry the meaning.","""and the gentleness that comes,not from the absence of violence, but despitethe abundance of it.""I read Richard Siken's poem ""Wishbone"" on the internet. I read it once and closed the page. The next day I was painfully aware I couldn't leave it behind. That my mind kept circling back to his words. So I read it and re-read it again and again. Dozens of times, until I realised it would never be enough, so I ordered his book.I have never in my life anticipated the arrival of a book more than I did with this. My entire body was aching for it. And then it arrived. With a start like this, and with expectations as high as mine, you'd think the book would come up short. That it would somehow not deliver. But it does. It truly fucking does. Siken is beyond talented with words, that much is clear, this entire collection is a work of pure art, something you rarely find these days. Every line is powerful, it's got secrets. Every poem has meaning, and soul and something deeply terrifying about it. I am in love with it. That's the easiest way to put it. My copy is worn out from being opened, read in, then thrown onto the table or put carelessly down as I try to gather myself up from my messy emotional pile on the floor and try to deal with, well... myself. I've read many books, some of them have taught me about the world, about people, about feelings or ideas. This book taught me something monumental about myself. It changed me, and I'm not even kidding or exaggerating. I read it (or devoured it might be more accurate) and suddenly found a side of myself put into words. Words I was never able to find myself, but needed more deeply than I'd realised.I'll never stop reading this book, and that's the great thing with poetry, analyzing, understanding and interpreting and simply feeling it, is a never-ending process. I carry his words with me everywhere, both in the shape of his actual book, but also in who I am. ""Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.These, our bodies, possessed by light. Tell me we'll never get used to it."""

She's unlocked her word-hoard and used every nook and cranny of it in service of a very specific reading of the text.I really love Old English as a language, and have read Beowulf in the original more than once. But despite generally liking translation as a medium, I have never really liked any translation of Beowulf. I loved this, though. It does what I think the best translations always do, which is to write something completely new which translates the thoughts and ideas of the original without getting too distracted by the actual words.The thing is, what register should you use if you're translating a text from the Early Middle Ages? Most of the time, people go for the archaic stuff – words like ‘betwixt’, ‘verily’, you know, the things that tell you you're reading a serious poetic work. Tolkien said that if you didn't use archaisms, then you weren't doing justice to Beowulf at all, since much of its language would have been archaic even to its original audience (though this is very hard to be certain of). Seamus Heaney added a few regionalisms to the mix. Headley does use the odd archaism and regionalism – but her primary tool is an American ‘guy slang’, which is a wonderfully productive lens through which to read a poem like this one, concerned as it is with ‘manly virtues’.It cuts through the aphoristic vagueness of a line like Gǣð ā wyrd swā hīo scel (‘Fate will be as it will be’), reducing it to the pithy ‘Bro, Fate can fuck you up’, which is really what is meant. Individual translation choices are often glorious. Searwum fāh ‘decorated with artistry’ here becomes ‘blinged-out’, where again the audacity does not obscure the accuracy. It works particularly well in direct speech. When Beowulf is criticising one of the Danes for allowing Grendel to pillage at will, he says:hē hafað onfunden,    þæt hē þā fǣhðe ne þearf,atole ecg-þræce    ēower lēodeswīðe onsittan[‘he'd found that there was no need to fear any enmity here, or any terrible sword-storm from your people’]Most translators stick to this fairly closely, often with some arty flourish in however they handle ecg-þræce. But Headley's approach gets right to the heart of the one-upmanship underlying this conversation:“Grendel was aware he had nothing to fear here.Your sword's soft, son.”In a similar vein, consider the bit where Hrothgar gives some advice to Beowulf. The original reads:   Ðū þē lǣr be þon,gum-cyste ongit!    Ic þis gid be þēāwræc wintrum frōd.[‘Learn from this, understand manly virtues. I who recite you this song am many winters old.’]Again, Headley drenches the passage in coded male dynamics:Listen to me, boy. Keep your shit straight.I've been fostered by frost-seasons, fathered by time,and I'm dropping knowledge now.It must be said that a lot of the time, as is probably already obvious, Headley is inventing freely. At one point Beowulf is described as being ‘swole as a troll’ – what a brilliant way to translate…whatever that is, I thought; but when I turned to the original, I realised it wasn't translating anything, it was just a random insertion of Headley's own devising, presumably for added ambiance. Something similar happens at Wealhtheow's appearance in the hall, when we get the half-line ‘Hashtag: blessed’ as a complete invention. Some of these novelties are rather cheeky: she describes the dragon's treasure, in passing, as a ‘pile of preciouses’ (which I love). How you feel about such things will depend on many factors, including your opinions on translation and your feelings about modern slang. I really enjoyed it, but it should probably be understood that a lot of it is made up out of whole cloth.When it works, it works really well. When Beowulf boasts about his past exploits to Hrothgar, Heaney in 2000 translated it like this:They had seen me boltered in the blood of enemieswhen I battled and bound five beasts,raided a troll-nest and in the night-seaslaughtered sea-brutes. I have suffered extremesand avenged the Geats (their enemies brought itupon themselves, I devastated them).This is perfectly serviceable, and pretty ‘faithful’ on a word-by-word basis. But it seems utterly inadequate compared to Headley's already-famous rendering of this passage:Yes: I mean—I may have bathed in the blood of beasts,netted five foul ogres at once, smashed my way into a troll denand come out swinging, gone skinny-dipping in a sleeping seaand made sashimi of some sea monsters.Anyone who fucks with the Geats? Bro, they have to fuck with me.They're asking for it, and I deal them death.See, this is a translation with a real voice, which is something translators often struggle to find. In this case, the voice is in service of a very specific agenda, which has to do with rethinking the gender assumptions of the poem. Headley makes much of her reinterpretation of Grendel's mother, for instance, pointing out that āglǣcwīf literally just means ‘fighter-woman’, but is often translated with things like ‘monstrous hell-bride’ (that's Heaney).I think this is maybe not as controversial as she makes out – the nature of Grendel's mother has always been a rather uncertain thing, and in my copy of the text (Mitchell & Robinson, which is more than twenty years old), āglǣcwīf is glossed unremarkably as ‘warrior-woman, female combatant’. It seems to me more problematic that Grendel's mother is later described as grundwyrgen, which really has to mean something like ‘beast of the deep’. Headley doesn't mention this piece of vocabulary (which she translates as ‘reclusive night-queen’). Still, this translation is a kind of line in the sand, and it will definitely be impossible for future translators to make lazy assumptions about Grendel's mother's inhumanness from now on.(Incidentally, Headley also makes the dragon female, against the many translators who, she says, write it as male ‘rather than ungendered’. It's not clear what she means by this – true, Old English draca is a neuter word, but the monster is usually referred to as a wyrm, which is definitely grammatically masculine. Anyway, it works well as a female creature whatever the justifications might be.)Now look, I have to admit that I did not read this without some…qualms? about the way Headley appropriates the linguistic trappings of male-male socialisation. It is one thing to say, as a brilliant pub-conversation starter, that Beowulf is basically an Anglo-Saxon dudebro. It's another thing to sustain this conceit over three thousand lines. The effect is that we are reading a kind of parody of maleness which, while fascinating, strips away much of the emotional authenticity of what is being said, in favour of poking fun at the characters' preconceptions. It doesn't come across (to me) as a real depiction of how men interact, but rather as a strangely skewed, inevitably outsider's view of what male interaction can look like.But this is no bad thing; one of the reasons I think this is such a good translation is because it's such a productively argumentative one, with something really new to say about Beowulf. And about its eponymous central character, whose blokey claims to fame Headley smiles at even while fulfilling (with considerable brio) the poem's predictions:You're famous here, and long after your lifetime,you'll be known, your story sweeping as the sea,shores borne into being by waves of words.","”One of these things, as far as anyone ever can discern, looks like a woman; the other, warped in the shape of a man, moves beyond the pale bigger than any man, an unnatural birth called Grendel by country people in former days. They are fatherless creatures, and their whole ancestry is hidden in a past of demons and ghosts. They dwell apart among wolves on the hills, on windswept crags and treacherous keshes, where cold streams pour down the mountain and disappear under mist and moorland.”

It rained, but it was too cold to be raining. A combination of warmer atmosphere and colder temperatures on the ground produced an ice storm. The storm came in over the weekend so I could sit comfortably by my fireplace and watch out the window as the rain formed into sheets of ice on the streets and sidewalks. Power lines thickened as they became cubed in ice. Foot long and longer icicles dangled and swayed from the power lines, from the eaves of houses, from signs, from fence lines. The most affected though were the trees. The trees with the thicker branches were the most distressed, groaning under the added weight. As the ice accumulated on the branches of the smaller trees they bent and twisted to the ground. They became monsters, slumbering beneath an armor of ice. I’d been thinking about rereading Beowulf for some time. This story has been a part of me for almost as long as I can remember. The idea of a mere man taking on a monster that was much stronger than most men, and finding a way to defeat him was compelling and inspiring mythology for my young mind. The terror of it, the monster that comes into your home and slaughters your friends and families in the dead of the night and takes heads as trophies, left shivers in the very center of me. Beowulf hears of a monster who is attacking the Danes. He is one of thirteen men who decide to go to the rescue of Hrothgar, King of the Danes. He goes because he needs to make a name for himself, as Buliwyf in the movie The 13th Warrior says: ” I have only these hands.” Beowulf is poor, renown for his strength, but he has no Hall to call his own and, but for this small band, no men to call him King.”Their mail-shirts glinted, hard and hand-linked; the high-gloss iron of their armour rang. So they duly arrived in their grim war-graith and gear at the hall, and, weary from the sea, stacked wide shields of the toughest hardwood against the wall, then collapsed on the benches; battle-dress and weapons clashed. They collected their spears in a seafarers’ stook, a stand of greyish tapering ash. And the troops were as good as their weapons.” I had spent most of the day finishing another book and, thus, had started reading Beowulf late in the evening. My wife and our Scottish Terrier had gone to bed, and I was left in the soft glow of my reading lamp. Most of the city had lost power as lines too heavy with ice had crashed down one by one. It never crossed my mind, power or no power, that I would go to bed. I had candles close to hand. Beowulf was written in Old English between 975-1025. The Seamus Heaney translation that I read had the Old English on one page and Heaney’s translation on the other page. In college, I took a Chaucer class and became a fair hand at deciphering Middle English, but looking and even pronouncing these unfamiliar words did not ring any ancient bells in my English soul. To use an old phrase it was Greek to me. 




1,000 year old manuscript of Beowulf.
As Beowulf grapples with Grendel and then with Grendel’s mother, I was just as enthralled with the story as I was as a wee tot. The carnage, the darkness, the uncertainty that Beowulf had to feel, despite his boasts to the contrary, all lend a fine, sharp edge to the tale. As I read, I also started to hear the sharp cracks and howls of ice laden tree limbs separating from their trunk in much the same way as Beowulf pulls Grendel’s arm loose from his shoulder. The crash of these ice shrouded branches against the frozen ground resounded in my mind like the steel swords of the Geats banging against their metal wrapped shields. Curiosity got the better of me, and I walked out of my back door into an alien landscape. Each individual stem of grass had frozen into a nub of ice. With every step, my boots crunched and slipped across this icy topography. Piles of limbs lay at the bottoms of the bigger trees. A small limb detached from the cottonwood tree as I stood there and made discordant music as it bounced against the limbs below before finally landing among its fallen, dying brethren on the ground. The younger trees, more limber, were probably fine, I told myself. They are bowed over as if in supplication to Mother Nature. Their top branches were frozen to the ground, making arches of their shapes. It was all very beautiful. I remembered reading about a party that was given for the Russian princess Anastasia before her life became tangled in the turmoil of revolution. The servants were outside spraying water on the trees so they would glitter with ice as the aristocracy arrived on their horse pulled, bell laden sleighs. I went back inside and peeled off my boots and jacket and eagerly returned to Beowulf. Another log was required for the fire, so I spent a few moments poking the remaining logs to make room for more wood. I flinched as I heard more crashes from outside. An assembly of Geats preparing for battle? When I finally settled back into my chair, Beowulf has become King of the Geats and is fighting battles with the greatest champions of the land. He involves himself in disagreements. ”When Eofor cleft the old Swede’s helmet, halved it open, he fell, death-pale: his feud-calloused hand could not stave off the fatal blow.”I just loved that…feud-calloused hand. I also really liked..”your blade making a mizzle of his blood.” There are evocative lines like that all through the story. Words unfamiliar and redolent of a different age. An older and slower Beowulf does need the help of others in his final battle against a dragon, but few men are made of the same courage, and those standing with him failed to help him when he needed them most. He does kill the dragon, but at the cost of his own life. What better way for a legendary warrior to leave this world with his sword in his hand and his armor stained with dragon's blood. Valhalla has a place waiting for him. 
No sword blade sent him to his death,My bare hands stilled his heartbeatsAnd wrecked the bone-house. Now blade and hand,Sword and sword-stroke, will assay the hoard.”
Stormy weather requires the proper book and a cuppa of strong hot Welsh tea laced with a splash of Scotch whiskey. For me Beowulf, those 3,182 muscular and magnetic lines, added enchantment and necromancy to a world transforming before my eyes into something magical and unknown.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"
The Poet X,Elizabeth Acevedo,4.37,"“And I think about all the things we could be if we were never told our bodies were not built for them.” 
4½ stars. Wow, this was so good.I recently read Acevedo's With the Fire on High and I found it to be sweet and enjoyable, but I felt like a little something was held back. Like the book played it too safe and didn't really excite me. It was feel-good, and that's just fine, but if I'm being honest I'm a bit of a drama llama. 🦙This book, though. This book is heart-wrenching and powerful. Acevedo should most definitely continue writing poetry as it seems to be where she excels, and it comes as no surprise to hear she had a background in poetry slams. Xiomara's voice felt so real, so vulnerable and painfully honest as she talks about growing up as a curvy girl in Harlem - the whispers of ""cuero"" follow her around even before she's even had chance to figure out her own sexuality.The Poet X is a bildungsroman, of sorts, about a girl becoming aware of her own body and sexuality. This takes her through a complex range of emotions-- desire, shame, fear, anger, doubt, and pleasure, all rendered beautifully and effectively on the page. Religion also plays a huge part. Xiomara clashes with her devout mother and this leads to some truly horrifying parts of the story. In fact, I think the only downside was the way this was resolved. Certain things seemed too neat for my tastes and certain people seemed to change quickly in a way that wasn't quite believable to me her mom goes from making her kneel in rice and pray to the Virgin Mary to suddenly allowing her boyfriend over? Hard to believe even with the intervention of the priest. I was glad, though, that the author took some steps towards portraying her mother as more than some stereotypical crazy religious harpy. {On a side note-- this type of character fascinates me: the woman who loves her god more than her children. She's appeared in everything from coming-of-age tales like this one to horror stories like Carrie. I don't understand her, but I would like to read a book from her perspective. I imagine it would take a brave author to attempt to humanize her. I wonder if it would be successful...}This free verse, non-rhyming style of poetry is hit and miss for me. Many times I am left feeling as if I've just read chopped up prose or a selection of tumblr quotes, and I can't quite understand why they bother writing it as poetry at all. This was not one of those cases. Acevedo creates very powerful scenes and moments with this style, that I think might have been lost in a regular prose novel. The short, sharp, hard-hitting nature of the poems made each one a knife into my heart. I mean that in a good way.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube","#ThePoetX was so beautiful that I didn’t want to highlight it or dog ear pages, so I just took pictures basically every pageThis was the type of book where “I’ll just do 50 pages” turned into finishing it in 2 readsI felt very emotional reading this book, not just because the story and the words themselves were so beautiful, but because I knew it was going to make so many teens who felt like no one cares about them or listens to them feel seen. I also knew that if I had had books like this or Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds as a kid, I wouldn’t have taken me until the age of 17 to realize I loved reading and writingCan’t say enough good things about these books, everyone should pre-order and read it! It’s out 3/6/18!!","This was a surprising read for me!! I do not read poetry, nor do I typically like it, therefore I have avoided reading books in verse for years. I decided to pick up the audiobook from my library just because it was so short, but I’m so pleased I gave it a chance. This is a story absolutely everyone should experience.CW: sexism/misogyny, homophobia, slut-shaming, abuse, sexual assault/harassmentI would HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this novel. I don’t have an experience with the physical novel to compare it to, but Elizabeth Acevedo does a fantastic job of performing her novel. The passion for her writing and the power behind her words comes through so strongly by listening. Plus, it’s only about 4 hours and is extremely easy to fall into. You will DEVOUR this audiobook.The writing is INCREDIBLE. I know nothing about poetry and sentence structure in verse, but I KNOW Elizabeth Acevedo is a master. Her syntax is inhumanely perfect, every word carefully chosen and placed where it is meant to be. I’m genuinely shocked this is a debut as the author appears so competent and experienced in her craft. If you are yearning for a story with beautiful writing and a memorable voice, The Poet X absolutely needs to be on your list.I was really shocked with how much I resonated with this novel. Xiomara’s story deals with endless important topics, from dealing with sexism to questioning her faith as well as coping with her difficult family life and exploring her own identity. I went into this novel expecting to read a story about someone very different from myself (a Dominican teen with a twin brother who comes from a very strict, religious household) but came away relating to Xiomara in a way I have not connected with a character in a while. I felt so heard in the way Xiomara expresses her experience as a girl, not only in how she receives so much unwanted attention and objectification, but also in how she learns to recognize her value and take pride in herself. I love watching girls know their worth and finally lay claim to the space they are entitled to take up in this world, physically and emotionally. I’m taken aback with how accurately this story spoke to me, but I’m also leaving this story so empowered.The Poet X was an enchanting story about what it means to be a girl, a sister, a daughter, but most importantly, what it means to be your own individual person. Xiomara is immensely creative, talented, likeable, and relatable. She has a story to tell that you won’t want to miss. I don’t think I would consider this an absolute favorite of mine, but it is an amazing story that I’d recommend to absolutely anyone."
Paradise Lost,John Milton,3.85,"There's all this debate over why Satan is so appealing in Paradise Lost. Did Milton screw up? Is he being cynical, or a double-secret atheist? And why is God such a dick?But no one asks whether, say, Shakespeare screwed up in making Iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain. And that's all Milton's doing. Satan is tempting for us because Satan is tempting for us. That's the point of Satan! If Milton didn't make him as appealing as possible, he'd be doing Satan a disservice. And Eve, for that matter.Similarly, God's a dick because God's a dick. You've read the Old Testament. He's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either. Again, Milton's just being true to his characters, and writing a great story while he's at it. There’s slightly more to it than that, yeah. For example: it's hinted a little that God sets Satan up to fall. He gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of Heaven. But since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech, why give the warning? Isn't that like saying ""Don't touch these cookies while I'm gone"" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out?Here’s my advice to people considering reading Paradise Lost: read the first two books. It starts with a bang, and it’s pretty amazing for a while. It slows down a bit in books III - VII, so if you’re not totally sold in the first two books (I was), you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what Milton sounds like, or skip to books IX and X. IX is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you’re a misogynist), and X is an astonishing sequence where Adam and Eve contemplate suicide:""Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out To deathless pain? How gladly would I meetMortality my sentence...his dreadful voice no moreWould thunder in my ears."" (Adam, X.774 - 780)“We’ve totally mucked this up, and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of Paradise, and maybe we should just quit while we’re behind.”But really, the whole thing is worth it. Took me a while – it’s intense stuff, so I found that I had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one – but it’s cool.In book VIII, if you’re cosmologically minded, Milton lays out the whole universe. Like Giordano Bruno, he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe, and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours, and therefore could have planets like ours around them. He also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be God's only experiment. Elsewhere, other Adams and Eves may have faced the same test of the Tree of Knowledge - and they might have passed it. Isn't that an amazing thought?In books XI and XII, Michael tells Adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the Old Testament, which of course boil down to:“So shall the world go on,To good malignant, to bad men benign,Under her own weight groaning.” (XII 537 – 539)That’s your fault there, Adam. Nice work.He rushes through them though, and it makes me wonder whether Milton had originally intended to retell the entire Old Testament but got bored or intimidated or something. That would’ve been remarkable. Certainly Paradise Lost is better literature than the Old Testament is, and significantly more coherent.It's also better literature than almost everything else. Second-best poem by a blind guy ever.","in middle school i had seen this book lying around the house and for some reason it struck me as very impressive. i didn't ever want to read it but i wanted to give off the impression that i was the type of person who would read it. i did this with a few other books too (catcher in the rye, on the road, ect.) i carried it to school so that teachers would see it in my possession and prominently displayed it on my bedside table to let friends and family know. after actually reading the book for a brit-lit class i realized how wrong my thirteen-year-old self was with the image i assumed i was portraying. most likely people realized that i was desperate for attention and for some strange reason was using john milton to get it, but on the off chance they did believe i was 'into' paradise lost, i must have seemed like a total psycho. the book is about a war waged in hell after satan's fall into the underworld. all of the descriptions are completely graphic and grotesque. i think i blocked a lot out but i do remember a female demon who is repeatedly raped by her sons immediately after giving birth to them. yuck. thank god i realized later that the best way to get attention is through cigarettes and promiscuity not literature.","THE CONQUEST OF PRIDE.The road winds inListlessness of ancient war,Langour of broken steel,Clamour of confused wrong, aptIn silence. Memory is strongBeyond the bone. Pride snapped,Shadow of pride is long....T.S. ELIOT, RANNOCH AT GLENCOEWhich way I turn is Hell -Myself am Hell.SATAN, FROM ‘PARADISE LOST’When T.S. Eliot visited the Scottish Highlands in his later years, he saw at first hand the site of the Glencoe Massacre at the time of the doomed Jacobite uprising of 1689. As he mused, who knows if he also thought of his own earlier words on this poetry, poetry that was composed at a religiously fractious moment of British history in the same timeframe as Glencoe - Milton's Paradise Lost? Perhaps he was remembering his comment that Milton could never endear himself to us readers.But maybe also this great twentieth century poet called to mind, as he meditated on war and pride, his own opinion that ""there is no wisdom beyond the wisdom of humility.“Pride begins and ends all wars, and pride can be the downfall of anyone’s religion. But humility is grace.And pride is the last enemy we must defeat on the road to self-knowledge.John Milton was a proud man, and he was valiantly attempting to ""work out (his) salvation with diligence"" - as Eliot‘s character of the psychiatrist says in The Cocktail Party - within the confines of a religion of Love, in which his own immense ego could barely fit.A doomed enterprise.As it was for me. My wounded heterosexual ego - for years - was crushed by the modern burden of sexual diversity.And the crushed, blind Milton of the later Samson Agonistes was still smothered in the smoky remnants of a hellish pride, as is his Satan in this work - with whom Milton subconsciously sympathizes. And that's the problem. William Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, implies that Satan’s fall is in reality Jesus’ fall, which totally appalls me, but there, but for Grace, have gone I. Obviously with this revelation evidence is mounting that Milton was Gnostic.What is a Gnostic? Someone who puts themselves first, over against God and goodness (more than guilty, your honour). So Gnosticism is the oldest cult of them all.Again, that applies to my own dark past. For as John Milton was rooting for the puritanical underdogs over and against the “licentious” Stuarts, so did I, albeit in a more modern sexual context.Which is it - the humility of the Lord or the pride of Satan? Get with the program, Fergus!It seems that as long as we, like Milton, seek a separate transcendence from our fellows in our beliefs, those beliefs will be to some extent defined by pride.Pride seeks transcendence; while humility abases itself to a state of immanence. There may be no religious faith other than the Pauline one which accepts the full weight of life’s inherent problematics.Many outside of faith, similarly, seek transcendence - some in great power, though others through idealizing their ideas of sexuality and living those ideals through their acts.If you take your life without those transcendent ideals you’re on the right path, though it hurts like all get out to do that. Yet that’s what Christian existentialists like Kierkegaard and Jaspers tell us to do. I must learn ever anew from them.Milton lived in his poetic ideals as others among us live in their sexual ideals. And so life becomes for them a game to be won ever anew, until old age puts the kibosh to all that. Yet, those who seek in resignation to live life in forever experiencing its problematic aspects, will be forever renewed in its vigour. Any form of escape will prove to be spiritual suicide.The majestic, rumbling cadences of this great work inspire our awe, but the epic doesn't satisfy, because of this inherent duality of meaning and intent. For the real meaning of Losing Paradise is found in the transcendence of pride.So, to sum up: The epic battles are incredible, but they are filled with the ""clamour of confused wrong."" The poetry floors us, but the ego of its author turns us off. (And I apologize for my identical behaviour here.)The overall architecture is superb, but there is a crack in its cornerstone.Five stars for an otherwise incredible masterpiece of literature. A fractured masterpiece - to more objectively wary (and rightly so) modern eyes."
Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair,"Pablo Neruda, W.S. Merwin (Translator), Cristina García (Introduction)",4.20,"Tonight I Can Write Tonight I can write the saddest lines. Write, for example, ""The night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance."" The night wind revolves in the sky and sings. Tonight I can write the saddest lines. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. Through nights like this one I held her in my arms. I kissed her again and again under the endless sky. She loved me, sometimes I loved her too. How could one not have loved her great still eyes. Tonight I can write the saddest lines. To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her. To hear the immense night, still more immense without her. And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture. What does it matter that my love could not keep her. The night is starry and she is not with me. This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance. My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer. My heart looks for her, and she is not with me. The same night whitening the same trees. We, of that time, are no longer the same. I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her. My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing. Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses. Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes. I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long. Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. Though this is the last pain that she makes me suffer and these the last verses that I write for her.","Ew! Poetry!  Twenty short love poems by renowned Pablo Neruda. Coincidentally I think I must've read this like twenty years ago. My first poetry book, and sadly not my last. I think Neruda is actually quite good, his fame precedes him; it's my issue, I just hate poetry. The only one I liked is number XVIII. “Here I Love You.”And by like I mean it was the only one that didn’t make me barf uncontrollably.-----------------------------------------------

Coincidentemente creo que leí esto casi veinte años atrás. Mi primer libro de poesía, y tristemente no el último. De hecho creo que Neruda es bastante bueno, su fama lo precede; es mi problema, es sólo que yo odio la poesía.

NOTA PERSONAL
: [1924] [60p] [Poesía] [Recomendable Condicional] -----------------------------------------------","3 THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK1. I went to Pablo Neruda's house once. Well, I went to one of his houses. He had three of them. I was teaching English in Santiago, Chile at the time. I went to Neruda's house in Valparaiso, which is a beach town. Weirdly enough, I visited on my twentieth birthday, on a lark, because I just happened to be vacationing in a nearby cabin with my host family.The thing that I remember about Pablo Neruda's house is that it's set back in a grove of dark pine trees and that there's sand everywhere. The sky was dark that day and it was cold, even though it was in the summer. What I remember most about the experience wasn't the house itself, or the tour, or the nationalistic trinkets that vendors were trying to sell, but rather the feeling that the pine trees around the house evoked. They were like a dark magic that still sits in my mind six years later. Curious. Because this is the thing that stands out to me most about Neruda's poetry: the magnetic feeling of nature. The dirt and the flesh and the elements and the cold, wet, hot, dry. His poetry is so sensual, so primal, so tied to the earth (I know I sound like a hippie, but its true). When I look at my journal entries from this period in my life they're full of this sort of talk. I wrote about stars and cloud formations and the consistency of mud and the shape of a cheekbone. Southern Chile does this to you. The land casts a spell on you. Neruda put this spell into words. ""Who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south?   2. I read ""Twenty Love Poems"" about five years ago, but I thought it was corny at the time. The edition I read had all these terrible erotic etchings in it. I hate that. I almost threw up. I don't believe in illustration much, because it insults the reader's imagination. Especially illustration in poetry, a genre which usually uses abstract images.This time when I read ""Twenty Love Poems"" I read it slowly. And it reminded me of southern Chile. It reminded me of gloomy mountains, and the beauty of the rivers and clouds and the darkness of the ocean. It reminded me of that period of time, when I turned twenty, right before my life changed in many ways. This time when I read ""Twenty Love Poems"" it meant something to me, because now I have been in love. I have been in love and have experienced all of the sorrows and thrills of love. Mostly sorrows. But the hope of future thrills.3. I found a musty Time/Life book about South America at a thrift store near my house. In the book there is a photograph of Mr. Neruda seated at a wooden desk at his house in Valparaiso. He is wearing a sweater and staring out the window. He has a pen and ink in front of him and he is holding his head as though he's deep in thought or distressed. Or both. I have hung this picture up in my apartment. It makes me want to write. It makes me remember all of the dark clouds. It makes me remember that ""love is so short, forgetting is so long."""
The Death of Us,Abigail Dean,4.04,"Thirty somethings, Isabel and Edward, are left completely devastated after a violent home invasion one Spring night in their South London home. The consequences leave them both with a myriad of issues. Sadly the trauma is such, that it leaves them without the words to express those issues, because the perpetrator didn’t just invade their home, he invaded their marriage and their minds.We follow Isabel and Edward in the succeeding years, and witness how much destruction that night caused, because it’s only when their attacker is caught, that it's finally time to tell the story of that night.Not to the world. Or to the man who did it. But to each other.Though something of a slow burn I was drawn into this crime/ love story, a story that is poignant and revealed slowly and carefully to the reader, allowing us to become intimate with the characters, sharing both their pain and their passion. Moreover, there’s still hope, for without hope there is nothing.*I was invited to read The Death of Us by the publisher and have given an honest unbiased review in exchange.*","Wow! Such an emotional, heart-wrenching read! Was not expecting that!Isabel and Edward met through a mutual friend while attending their respective universities. At the time, each were dating someone else. But alas, the heart wants what the heart wants and the pull was too strong. They were simply meant to be.Years later, happy and quite content in life, their world is forever damaged by the intrusion of The South London Invader. The couple is now left to put the pieces of their lives back together. But will that include each other? Is their love strong enough to restore their magical relationship?Trauma… big or small it’s still trauma. It reshapes you into someone new. Someone you don’t recognize but that’s the new you, who must carry forth.Not only is this book a retelling of the night in question, but even more so a narrative on the strength of the characters and of love.I’m a bit speechless having finished this book. My heart is heavy, yet filled with the hope of no matter the circumstance there is always a chance for healing.This was my first read of 2025 and I cannot think of a better way to start the New Year than with a five- star read.Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group Viking","Disturbing and thought provoking but….When Edward and Isabel are thirty years old, they become the latest Victims of a serial killer, dubbed “The South London Invader”. He preys on “happy couples” watching them painstakingly for weeks so that he can plan the perfect attack.ONE NIGHT CHANGES EVERYTHING.Each deals with the traumatic event differently. Isabel wants to TALK about it-with Edward, with the press, and with Etta-the Detective in charge-and it is a story that all of London wants to hear!Edward doesn’t want to talk about it at all.Twenty-five years later, Nigel Wood is caught, and Edward and Isabel, now divorced will reunite for his sentencing. It is an opportunity to deliver impact statements and perhaps to finally get closure about the relationship that they lost as a result of the crime they endured.The story unfolds from the POV’s of Isabel and Edward. Isabel’s chapters are written like it is her IMPACT STATEMENT chronicling the PAST, while Edward’s chapters cover the PRESENT timeline.The premise is interesting, but I DID NOT find the book to be a thriller, or suspenseful as advertised. Instead it reads like a character study-with the CHARACTER being the MARRIAGE, and the pace was extremely SLOW.The story is supposed to demonstrate that a traumatic event like this can destroy even the strongest of marriages, yet I DIDN’T find their love story to be epic at all. Edward is a bit dull, and Isabel is a bit cold. If the descriptions of their intimacy, using the crudest of terms (C word) is supposed to convince us of their love-it didn’t work for this reader.Early reviews seem to be split between high praise and the opposite, with few in between-and I am one who struggled to get through it. This was a buddy read with DeAnn and Mary Beth…Did they feel differently? Be sure to watch for their reviews. ⚠️ TW: Graphic descriptions of rape/assault2.5 stars rounded upExpected publication date: April 15, 2025Thank You to Penguin Viking for the gifted ARC provided through NetGalley.

Ruth Run,Elizabeth Kaufman,3.62,"Taking off like a bullet from the very first word, Ruth Run was both fast-paced and addictive. From the distinct dual POVs to the epic game of cat-and-mouse, I was glued to the pages of this debut as these two original personas tried to outfox one another. A quick, easy rollercoaster ride that kept me on the edge of my seat, the dynamic between the pair was what had me reading this book in one single sitting. After all, not really a thriller but also too propulsive for straight-up suspense, I was almost completely won over by this near pitch perfect, unputdownable novel.Why almost, you ask? Well, I was head over heels for Ruth in all of her brilliant, hardcore, feminist glory—until she lost me at the end. A strong, morally gray character who had an eye for revenge, I was 100% behind her decisions except for that last glaring one. I won’t go into specifics, but just know that it made me frown just when I was cheering her on. Just the same, her character matched up well with Mike—an icky approximation of a man who made me want to squirm—and LuAnn, who was Ruth’s ultimate rival in no uncertain terms.Other than the last bothersome page, though, the only other “flaw” that I could find was the need to suspend all disbelief. It wasn’t because it was over-the-top, but more along the lines of how a Jason Bourne-type plot leans into adrenaline delivery. Hard-hitting and with palpable tension, this book is most definitely primed for the screen. And let me tell you, despite the last page, I would happily be seated in the very first row if it makes it to a theater near me. After all, who doesn’t love a cross-country chase that ends in revenge?All in all, thanks to short chapters, non-stop action, and a couple of deft twists, I was duly impressed. I mean, it was that wonderful combo of unguessable and compelling. So as long as you love strong female main characters, a few evil villains, and a plot that will have you holding on for dear life, you’ll love this book as much as I did. I just wish I could give it the five glowing stars I was planning on before that last damning sentence. Despite that, however, I’ll still happily read whatever Ms. Kaufman comes up with next, including a sequel. Rating of 4.5 stars.SYNOPSIS:Twenty-six-year-old Ruth excels at microchip design but decides to get rich the old-fashioned way: robbing banks. She becomes a cybercriminal and devotes five years to siphoning more than $250 million out of the banking system using a hacked firewall chip that she created and only she knows how to access. Then one night an alarm goes off and she realizes she’s been discovered.Five hours later she’s on the run, chased across California and the West by a slew of government agents who see her as both a high-level national security threat and a potential intelligence asset. They’ll catch her dead or alive—whatever it takes to make sure no one else discovers what she knows. Each of these men is obsessed with the woman he’s hunting, certain he knows what makes her tick. But Ruth, always a step ahead, armed with her ironic wit and a reluctant dog, eludes their understanding; can she elude their capture, too?Thank you to Elizabeth Kaufman and Penguin Press for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: April 15, 2025Content warning: stalking, religious extremism, gun violence, suicide, mention of: child sex trafficking, pedophilia","Meh This book is told from two perspectives: Ruth, who developed a computer chip that allowed her to steal a millions, and Mike, the government agent who has been following her and now that she is on the run he is trying to hunt her down--or is he? As various other agencies get involved in the cat and mouse chase, who will be victorious?My main problem with this book is that I had no idea why on earth Mike was so invested in what was going on with Ruth. We're thrown right into the story as Ruth is trying to get away, and I never could garner up many reasons to support one side or the other. I felt no connection to either of them and by the end I just wanted it to be over, I didn't care if she ultimately got away or not.My favorite parts were when Ruth came up with clever ways to slip out of their grasp, but it didn't happen very often. You definitely have to suspend disbelief through most of this book because some of the things that happen are so over the top unbelievable I was rolling my eyes. Overall, I was not very entertained by this book. Maybe you'll have better luck. It is a quick read with very short chapters to keep things moving. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.","Great debut novel! Fast paced, well written book. The writing style was unique. Ruth is a strong and nerdy smart woman.Ruth basically does what she wants to get her way. She has much potential, but feels unseen. I was disappointed with the ending."
The Museum Detective,Maha Khan Phillips,3.80,"Review first published on mysteryandsuspense.com“On thinking about Hell, I gather my brother Shelley found it was a place much like the city of London. I, who live in Los Angeles and not in London, find, on thinking about Hell, that it must be still more like Los Angeles.”–Bertolt BrechtDr. Gul Delani is the curator of the Heritage and History Museum in Karachi, Pakistan. When she is awakened one night by a call from the police, asking her to travel from her home in the capital to a remote desert area for an unspecified reason, she is not exactly pleased. But it’s the police, and it is not in her nature to refuse such a request.However, what she finds upon arriving at the site astounds her: during a bungled drug raid, the police have discovered, hidden in a cave, an ancient life-sized mummy, complete with a decorated sarcophagus. From a brief inspection, Gul believes the items are most likely authentic, but she urgently needs to secure them and move them to a controlled environment where she can verify her initial assessment.We soon learn that Gul has traveled a difficult road to reach her current position at the museum. Born into a wealthy family—her father founded the country’s first homegrown financial institution—she was determined to pursue her studies and build a career of her own. But her conservative parents had a different plan, one involving marriage, children, and a life of subservience. Gul found a way to achieve her ambitions, but the path was far from easy. Now, following her father’s death, the family business is run by her brother, Bilal—a shrewd financier with whom Gul fell out some time ago. Their estrangement, however, is overshadowed by the disappearance of Bilal’s daughter, Mahnaz, a sharp and witty young woman with whom Gul had formed a close bond. Despite extensive searching, Mahnaz’s whereabouts remain unknown.After securing the mummy and sarcophagus, Gul assembles a small team to fully assess this extraordinary find. Could it really be, as the symbols on the ancient sarcophagus suggest, over two thousand years old and linked to Persepolis, the capital of the Achaemenid Empire? Her work is quickly hindered—first by the unwanted interference of a well-connected male colleague at the museum, and then by a ruthless drug lord determined to steal the artifacts back. It is far from certain that Gul will be allowed to complete her examination.This novel delivers plenty of mystery and adventure, with intricate puzzles waiting to be unraveled. The fast-paced narrative is driven by compelling characters, particularly the intelligent and determined Gul. But beyond the action, the book also offers a vivid portrait of modern-day Pakistan—especially Karachi, a city shaped by relationships, networks, and deeply ingrained hierarchies. It highlights the challenges of being a career-driven woman in a society that often resists change. Once a cosmopolitan haven for minorities and those fleeing persecution, Karachi, as some now claim, has changed.If you’re looking for a novel that delivers both a thrilling story and insightful social commentary, this one will certainly fit the bill.My thanks to Soho Press for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","Praying this is made into a movie 😫 kickass protagonist, vivid setting, incredible story inspired by real life, and a MUMMY are you kidding me","The Museum Detective, set in Karachi, Pakistan, features Dr. Gul Denali, a curator at the Heritage and History Museum. The action begins in the middle of the night, as she is summoned by the police to a mysterious setting far out of the city to assess something they have found. She is a trained archaeologist, she does have a go kit at home ready to take with her. Thus begins a compelling adventure combining archaeology, history, museum culture, crime and corruption in Pakistan, and mystery. What exactly is this artifact that Gul is taken to examine? A mummy? But there is no history of mummies in Pakistan. This human sized apparent mummy will require very specific care and examination, as well as protection given the level of corruption in the city and having been found during a drugs raid. Gul is perfect for this position given her background in Egyptology.A second thread running constantly in the background is Gul’s missing niece, Mahnaz, who disappeared three years earlier. With this thought constantly thrumming in her head, Gul pulls together her team of students, employees and helpers and begins her plan of action. This is an exciting novel, well written, with many twists and turns. I do hope it is the start of a series. I like having a view into another culture through a novel I enjoyed. Some of the details of this story are based on an actual case that took place in Pakistan several years ago. My only wish was a dictionary at the end so I could understand the local words used in the text. This doesn’t impede the plot but only some of the details such as clothing or food which can often be guessed.Definitely recommended.Thanks to Soho Crime and NetGalley for an eARC of this book. This review is my own."
The Impossible Thing,Belinda Bauer,4.20,"4.5 rounded upThe anticipation of reading a new Belinda Bauer novel is off the scale or should that be off the cliffs at Bempton on the North Yorkshire coast with the climmers? 1920s, Bempton cliffs. Here, men such as Jim Chandler are lowered in a harness attached to a rope to steal the eggs of the many sea birds that nest there. Jim thinks he’s got a prize guillemot double yoker and a special egg like this can yield 10 bob (shillings) or even a pound on a good day. A lucrative (not necessarily moral but we’ll get to that) exercise in straitened times. A neglected, rejected farm girl Celie Sheppard at Metland farm a bit further along from Jim, dangles precariously over the cliff edge and finds an egg that will change the course of her life and that of her poverty stricken family. These will become the infamous mythical Metland eggs which people will die for or at the very least get tied up and robbed. Just ask Weird Nick and Patrick Fort in the present day. They learn only too well what lengths people will go to in order to track down the elusive red eggs. This original novel takes us on a journey of obsession, murder, mayhem and skulduggery that beggars belief. What a terrific novel. Who knew that a story centring on climmers and birds eggs would make such a gripping tale?! it is creative, clever, so different and I find it especially fascinating as I’ve been to Bempton cliffs several times. Into the bargain it’s also thought provoking, witty and funny on occasions, it’s sad and bittersweet, it’s a mystery thriller with plenty of shocks at all of the shenanigans that go on. The lengths that people will go to in order to fulfil their passions! It’s got it all.All the characters are good but a special shout out for Neurodivergent Patrick whose portrayal is both sensitive and exemplary and to Nick. The pair balance each other out so well as they go on quite an adventure. Also Celie and Robert from the 1920s who take me on an emotional journey. The narrative from the two timelines meld together seamlessly and allow understanding to grow. The ending is tense, exciting and feels right in every sense of the word.Next time I’m at Bempton seeking out the puffins, I’ll think of Celie and her perils and those special eggs. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to the publishers for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.","4.5 Stars raised to 5. When I first discovered a book by Belinda Bauer on Goodreads, I was enthralled with its original storyline and memorable characters This led me to read and enjoy all her books in rapid succession, and I considered her a must-read favourite crime writer. It has been a long time since her last book, and I was worried that she had retired from writing. I was excited to learn that she has a new book, 'The Impossible Thing,' coming soon, and was thrilled to obtain the ARC through NetGalley and the publisher. This went to the top of my reading list, and I neglected everything else to read it in one day.  The book introduced me to the obscure, mostly forgotten topic of egg collecting, and the story was riveting. The story examines the cruel world of egg trafficking on the cliffs of Yorkshire in the 1920s. Men are lowered on ropes over the cliffs where sea birds build their nests, putting some species in danger of extinction. Rival egg traffickers await them on the cliff above. They offer payment for the eggs retrieved and resell them to wealthy collectors and scientific institutions for a huge profit. It is a story of greed and the obsessive quest by wealthy men to obtain unique, priceless eggs valued for their colours and markings. The nesting birds are made frantic by their loss, and with their eggs being stolen, extinction is forthcoming. The most desired and priceless eggs have been retrieved by Celie, a tiny neglected girl from nearby Metland farm. She did not resemble her siblings, so the father left when she was born, leaving her mother to struggle on an impoverished farm. Her mother blamed Celie for everything, and the girl was undernourished and tiny, about the size of children half her age. Her small size and bravery led to her being lowered through a small opening on the cliff, where she obtained an unusual treasure, a vivid red egg from a guillemot pair that is highly coveted. By the late 1930s, Matland Farm had prospered due to money Celie received for her efforts, and she decided she was finished retrieving the precious eggs for the traffickers.  Later, Patrick Ford ( an autistic man from Rubberneckers) visits his friend Weird Nick. He finds Nick and his mother tied up in their remote home following a home invasion. The only thing stolen in the robbery was an elaborately carved case containing a scarlet egg. Nick had advertised the egg briefly on eBay but discovered that the selling bird's eggs was now prohibited by law.  The two young men decide to go on a quest to find the stolen egg Nick is brave and reckless, and Patrick's unique thought patterns make him invaluable in the search. He decides there is not just one egg missing but thirty eggs, according to the number of times Celie had been lowered through the small crevice. Very few have guessed this number exists, and the precious eggs may be hidden and forever lost to history. There are so many places where the eggs may have been kept secretly. Where to start looking? Patrick and Nick may be putting their lives in danger. Also, Celie, now married and pregnant, is at risk. I found the characters to be fascinating, but their vast numbers and names tended to confuse me. There were the names of children, workers on nearby farms, rival traffickers, obsessive and dangerous collectors, etc. I wish I had kept notes. Nevertheless, I was absorbed in the thrills and suspense of the story. I was happy to see hope in the present day that the extinction of wild sea birds may be avoided through the efforts of conservationists. I highly recommend this book and Bauer's previous books. 'The Impossible Thing' is due to be published on April 08. 2025.","Moving and swooping and sailing through sky and sea, just like the cliff birds, Bauer's story moves and moves until it ends and in the meantime it hooks me in and I don't want to leave. She delves into the fascinating obsession with eggs, beautiful eggs, stolen eggs. She adds in poverty, family and repercussions and lets us once again be present to part of Patrick and Nick's story. In this one she had me counting eggs and feeling sad and angry about the little guillemot.Like always her characters and through them their story is what keep me there. With her people I always find myself wanting more, wanting to be there, to see what they are doing. So it's good that she likes to revisit her characters in following books.

Home of the Happy: A Murder on the Cajun Prairie,Jordan LaHaye Fontenot,4.20,"I received a free copy of, Home of the Happy, by Jordan Lahaye Fontenot, from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. In Louisiana in 1983 a body was found, Aubrey LaHaye's body. Jordan LaHaye Fontenot, had questions about her grandfathers murder. This was a n interesting read, but im still left with questions not answered.","Beautifully brutal!A story of how tragedy affects so many and of our human need for the truth and for closure.This writer tells this story with input from all who were touched by this horrific event. But, this book is really about its author ,Jordan, who shares so generously,in every line,her own heart, spirt,and truth! Loved It! Dad(Pre released copy)","True-Crime Lovers:The way in which this book is written, I can already picture the screen-play. This book is so rich in details, it's truly incredible that the author was not there to witness the happening of this story in which she writes so carefully and vibrantly. Not only was I fully wrapped in the case as she lays it out so meticulously for you, but the ode to her family and where she grew up, had me feeling nostalgic towards my own family and hometown. Seriously, I feel like I need to call my mom, dad, Pappy and just listen to their stories.In all, this book was beautifully written, and had me hooked from the first page--holding on to each detail as she wove the tale of the kidnapping, murder, and all that was to follow."
Blood in the Water: The Untold Story of a Family Tragedy,Casey Sherman,3.87,"ARC for review. To be published April 8, 2025. Three stars for this true crime/family drama. Nathan Carman, a disaffected loner is connected to, not one, but two murders within his own family. Like, it’s the holidays and all, so I kind of see it, but really? One is hard enough to hide. Trust me, I’ve done the math on this. First Nathan’s wealthy grandfather is shot to death n his home. Then Nathan is pulled from the sea in a dramatic rescue and claims that the boat where he and his mother were fishing suddenly sank and he was the sole survivor. Of course there’s a great deal of money at stake. Is Nathan, who is on the autism spectrum, making him difficult to communicate with, guilty?Well, my friends, of course he is! This is really never in doubt…are you new? Nathan isn’t even a very good criminal but this is yet another story that shows just how hard it can be to convict someone of murder when even the proverbial blind man blah, blah, blah. While this is interesting true crime Nathan really is a sad sack, and you really want to see him pay.","I received a free copy of, Blood in the Water, by Casey Sherman, from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Nathan Carman lost his mother and grandfather to tragedy, but did he murder them, because of their great wealth? What a wild read, I was not prepared for the ending.","Enjoyed this true crime story, Nathan was a classic example of parents ignoring their child(ren’s) issues when they display certain behaviors at a young age. Nathan’s grandfather is murdered in his home, and his mother dies under suspicious circumstances a few years later. This wealthy family is divided, as the investigation is underway with Nathan being the likeliest suspect. The author did a good job recreating the events of this story and he did a great job with the narration as well. Thank you RBmedia and NetGalley for this advanced listening copy. All opinions are my own."
Senseless,Ronald Malfi,3.95,"5⭐️s Have you met the monkey? If you ever hear those words uttered, just know that nothing good will follow. (This part made my jaw drop. You’ll see what I mean.)Malfi is a brilliant author. The deftness with which these seemingly disparate stories are woven together, each carefully revealing interconnected details at a perfectly timed pace, is truly a masterclass. The horror is subtle while somehow also being formidable, and the line between the supernatural and the corporeal is expertly maneuvered. This is easily one of the best books I’ve read this year…
 Themes…
The weight of the secrets we carry is often more debilitating than the event that precipitated the need to keep the secret in the first place. Mental illness is also explored in a way that avoids the pitfalls of exploitation. 
 Character Work…
These characters are memorable. You can almost pinpoint where each might fall on a spectrum of flawed despicability. There is depth to every character, and we get to know them inside out, and we grow to have equal amounts of empathy and resentment towards each. 
 Prose…
Malfi’s writing is beautiful. I often find myself highlighting a sentence or two while reading because their beauty hits me in a remarkable way. On several occasions while reading this book, I would look up to find entire paragraphs highlighted. 
 Pace…
Well-paced. It’s not a whirlwind by any means, but there wasn’t a single moment I felt labored while reading. Every moment mattered, and each hit with an expertly measured tempo.","With Senseless, Ronald Malfi has crafted a creepy, captivating, supernatural, horrific and shocking tale. I had no idea where this book was going with the various subplots, but Malfi wove this book together expertly and brilliantly. This book touches on secrets, family, loss, relationships, the underbelly of Los Angeles, mental health, marriage, and horrific crimes.Whew! The body of a young woman has been found horribly mutilated outside of L.A. and Detective Bill Renney, who recently lost his wife, can't help but see the similarities between the murder and horrific mutilation of a woman the year prior. Maureen Park has recently become engaged to Hollywood producer, Greg Dawson and finds herself increasingly uncomfortable and feeling uneasy around his son, Landon. He seems to enjoy making people uncomfortable. Toby Kampen, is a young man who refers to himself as a Human Fly. He lives a solitary existence but when he meets a unique woman a bar who piques his interest and has him wondering if she human or something else altogether.As I mentioned, I had no clue where this book was going or how everything was going to come together. but Malfi pulled it off brilliantly. The characters are an interesting bunch with many of the characters being more unlikeable than the next. One or two were likeable, but ALL had secrets!This book was oozing with unease, tension, dread, and chilling moments! Plus, the atmosphere was top notch and added to the eerie vibe of this book. Hats off to Malfi for such a horrific, wonderfully written, and well thought out book!Fans of Malfi will not be disappointed. If you have not read a book by Malfi, you will want to sink your teeth into this one!*A Witches Words buddy read with Brenda ~The Book Witch. Please read her review as well to get her thoughts on SenselessThank you to Titan Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖","3.5 stars! ⭐️ Huge thanks to Tantor Audio & NetGalley for the ALC! ﻿💌Okay sooo... this isn't my usual type of read, and I'm guessing that’s why it didn’t totally land for me. First time reading Ronald Malfi and... I honestly don’t know if I’ll continue. BUT there were some things that got under my skin in a good way!The premise? Senseless follows three separate POVs:✧ Detective Bill Renney, grappling with grief and a murder eerily similar to a past case✧ Maureen Park, a small-town writer now engaged to a hotshot Hollywood producer (red flag alert)✧ Toby Kampen, aka “The Human Fly,” obsessed with a strange woman who may or may not be… human?Their stories slowly start to intersect in weird, eerie, uncomfortable ways.There's trauma, mental illness, secrets, creepy vibes, and that classic slow-building dread Malfi’s known for.Let me just say: the atmosphere? GRIPPING.Whether it's a sun-scorched desert or a shady Hollywood party, every setting drips with dread. And the writing?? So sharp and immersive it hurts. You don’t just read Malfi, you get sucked in, like some weird fever dream you can’t wake up from.And major shoutout to the narrators—Jenn Lee, Ray Greenley, and Joe Hempel absolutely nailed the tone and pacing. Each POV felt distinct and layered, and the performances added a whole extra level of tension and emotion. There were moments that legit gave me chills, especially during the more unhinged or emotionally raw scenes—they brought those characters to life in such a vivid, unsettling way.BUT…Plot-wise? Kinda messy.I felt like the story wanted to be a gritty mystery, but then dipped its toes into horror, then character study, then... something else entirely. Detective Renney was set up to be the heart of the story, but he honestly didn’t do much? He’s the emotional throughline, sure, but the actual detective work? Minimal at best. He mostly exists to get handed info by other people, which made me feel like the plot was dragging its feet.Toby's storyline was the most compelling—unhinged, raw, full-on spiraling energy. Maureen’s arc felt more like a psychological detour than a main course, and while it was interesting, I kept waiting for it to snap together with everything else in a more satisfying way.There were definitely scenes that hit (Toby in the desert?? HELLO?!), but a lot of it felt like a slow crawl to a finale that didn’t quite deliver the “AHA!” moment I was hoping for.Final thoughts?If you like your thrillers dark, gritty, and soaked in psychological weirdness, this might be your jam. Just go in knowing it’s more unsettling mood piece than twisty whodunit. For me, it was a mixed bag—some beautiful writing, strong themes, a haunting vibe… but an execution that didn’t fully hit."
Sleeper Beach,Nick Harkaway,4.19,"I NEED this, like, yesterday.","2.5Sleeper Beach is the second in Harkaway's Titanium Noir series. I hasten to add I have not read the first and this has probably coloured my rating because, for me, a lot of the references were completely unintelligible. That said I don't think I'll read the first or any others in this series, should there be more.Cal Sounder is a detective but he's also a Titan -which I gather is a human who has been given an injection which prolongs life but also gives the recipient more bulk. Cal is clearly bigger than the average human male but other Titans who have received more than one dose are considerably bigger - I'm not sure if this means height or fat or both. Cal is employed by a multiple injection Titan, Martha Erskine to investigate the death of a young woman, Ailsa Lloyd, whose body has washed up on a beach near her luxury home.Cal finds himself stepping into the murky dealings of the Erskine family as he tries to unravel whether Ailsa was murdered or killed by accident.That is the basic plot but there are so many other strands sewn into the plot that it'd take pages to explain what else Cal gets involved in. There's his being a Titan, which seems to offend people; his attachment to the rival Tonefamacasca family (and yes that is the most irritating name I ever came across - even one if the characters complains about it); there's the presence of the sleepers who appear to be suicidal people who have come to the beach to die; there are other law enforcement officers doing their own thing; there is a historical element which involves some form of revolt by unions ... As you can see, there's a lot to the book. The murder itself is almost lost in the narrative. In fact the only part of the book I really enjoyed was the end, which deals solely with the murder.Simply not for me. Overly complicated with not particularly likeable characters.Thankyou to Netgalley and Little, Brown Book Group for the advance review copy.","Sci fi noir. It kinda works. I like the main character, Cal, private investigator and titan. He goes about finding the murderer of a young woman found on the beach where depressed people go to await something maybe death. It’s a clever plot with twists and red herrings, I did find myself a bit bored with some of the detail. I must say I preferred Harkaway’s earlier books."
"Miss Caroline Bingley, Private Detective","Kelly Gardiner, Sharmini Kumar",3.76,"A fun historical/cozy mystery which was a mash up of Jane Austen and Agatha Christie. Always fun when you have references to Mr Darcy ❤️ This was a quick read , a missing maid, a murder and lots of secrets. Caroline and her friend Georgina are determined to solve the case, despite what the men say. It was a different time for women, and Caroline is certainly before her time. I can see this being. The start of a fun series. 3.5⭐️ thanks to HQ for my advanced copy of this book to read. Out in April 10th.","Content warnings: murder, racism, death of a sibling, death of a parent (in the past), grooming (in the past), violenceOh, I LOVED this. It gave me Phryne Fisher but 100+ years earlier, and I could absolutely see a younger Anna Chancellor reprising her role as Miss Bingley for an adaptation of this. I'm trash for an Austen inspired story, and I'm also trash for historical fiction that focuses on the diversity that was present in every freaking time period for all of human history. As someone much smarter than me once said, Black people [and, indeed, all people of colour] didn't magically appear as a result of the Civil Rights Movement. They've always been there. It's just that their stories don't get told. And I loved that this weaves the yikes-worthy history of the East India Company into an Austen inspired Regency based murder mystery. (In the interests of full disclosure, Sharmini is a close friend of mine. But I bought the book with my very own human dollars, and she did not ask me to say nice things about it.)","This book is set two years after the events of Pride and Prejudice.Caroline Bingley is staying in Derbyshire with her brother, Charles, and his wife, Jane. Charles and Jane bought a house near to the Darcys. During her stay, Caroline became firm friends with Miss Georgina Darcy, Mr Darcy’s younger sister.When Miss Darcy’s Indian maid, Jade, goes missing, Georgina goes in pursuit of her. She writes a note to Caroline asking for her friend’s discretion, but Miss Bingley is having none of it. She decides to follow Georgina to London in the search of the elusive maid.The two women find Jade, real name Jayani, crying over her dead brother’s body. It is evident that someone brutally killed him. But who?It appears that it’s up to Miss Bingley to investigate.I am in two minds about this book.I love Pride and Prejudice and I consider myself a true fan. I usually read the spin off stories and movie adaptations, and I was very excited to pick up a copy of this.I felt that there was something missing in Miss Bingley’s character. I loved that she worked on herself, studied, and decided that she didn’t need a man to be happy. Thanks to her family’s money, she established her own home in London, and she could come and go as she pleased. She was a shrewd woman, unafraid to put herself out there to solve a crime. However, the ‘original’ Miss Bingley was a bit snappy and quick with her tongue, and I guess that I missed that.I can’t fault the plot or the setting, I guess it was just my personal preference.This book wasn’t for me, but it might be for you!"
Tea and Cake and Death,"Gareth Ward, Louise  Ward",4.08,"4.5 rounded up Such a perfect small town cozy crime and centred around a bookshop?! Even better... I was so nervous that this book would not live up to my expectations, yet it most definitely did. This was such a well written sequel and it was such a fun time being brought back to the world of the Sherlock Tomes bookshop. The writing was brilliant and I found the characters and plot to be so engaging. I laughed and even cried at multiple points in the book. This small town banding together to help the sick and the creativie lengths they went to were so beautiful. As a bookseller, I treasured the subtle inside jokes, which made the story all the more relatable and enjoyable. Most importantly, the actual crime plot though not as good as the first book, was still brilliant.","If bookshops and staff worked as slow as the plot in this book, it would take forever to buy a book. I was so hoping for lots of action and fun and adventure in this story, yet what it ended up being was a very slow and amateurish plot with so much description that was not needed especially in a small and quiet town like Havelock that seemed to be filled with .Garth and Louise were puzzling protagonists. They were so unlike each other but they were nowhere near chalk and cheese. I did not understand the chemistry between them. Possibly because I didn't read the first book but there still should be no excuse for not having enough background information as to how they ran their book shop and their relationship foundation. The cast of secondary characters was equally as baffling. I'm no clearer on the Admiral, and at first I thought Stevie was a person, not a dog! And at one point I was hoping that Basil (the bookstore mouse) was going to save the day because he had more personality than anyone walking into that bookstore. I love the whole idea of Prudence hosting death meetings in the bookstore but I think her character was just taken too far and I think giving her more substance would have grounded her more as an integral part of this book.Whilst the plot was centred around how a serial killer jailed in the UK would still able to reach out into the town of Havelock to cause chaos and stress out Gareth and Louise was captivating, it just took so long to get the breadcrumb trail going, and keep the size of those bread crumbs substantial. More of a plot connection to poison used on particular characters, or even making more depth about the diabolical mushrooms could have really built the mystery factor and taken it up another notch. The idea of placing the authors (who actually own a bookshop and met in the police academy) and family dog into a book sounded quirky, but being barely disguised through fiction was grating. This was definitely not the book shop I had in mind.Thanks #penguin for the #gifted copy.",Another great read from Louise and Gareth my local bookshop owners. Knowing many of the characters portrayed in the story has probably made the book even more interesting. I regard my neighbour with even much greater respect...was wonderful any way. A great mystery revolving around the annually held battle of the book clubs. Why have so many people (and a beloved dog) fallen as a result of food poisoning? Finished well
Trzecia osoba,Anna Kańtoch,3.53,"Dobre vibes, wciągające i świetnie się czyta, ale to zakończenie to jednak jakieś takie nie całkiem dla mnie. Jest kilka świetnych i bardzo sprytnych zmyłek i tropów. Trzy perspektywy działają bardzo zgrabnie, obraz psychologiczny i socjologiczny też kupuję. Ale rozwiązanie... Znowu uciekamy się do zabiegu, który mnie nie przekonuje, i na tym, i na paru decyzjach postaci rozpełzło mi się zawieszenie niewiary. 1) W latach 90tych spokojnie zostawiono by te dzieci same w domu z kreskówką, nie ciągano by ich autem na zakopywanie zwłok. 2) I zapominanie i przypominanie sobie rzeczy zbyt wygodne i w dodatku zbyt wiele razy użyte przez Kańtoch. Chcę nowych motywów.","Duży zawód, jakby to nie była Anna Kańtoch. Niby czytało się dobrze, niby zagadka była i została wyjaśniona, ale przyjemność nikła, gdy wiem, na co stać autorkę.","W 1995 roku w lesie na Żywiecczyźnie porzucona została trójka małych Bresiów, dziewięcioletni Marcin, siedmioletnia Milena i dwuletni Mati. Ich rodzice, Mirosław i Marta, poprosili, aby przez chwilę dzieci pobawiły się same, gdy oni udadzą się do pobliskiego bunkra Waligóra. Jednak nigdy po nie, wbrew obietnicy, nie powrócili. Wychowaniem dzieci zajęła się mieszkająca w Katowicach babcia, Halina Breś.Tajemnicą zniknięcia sprzed trzydziestu lat pewnie nikt by się nie zajmował, gdyby nie zainteresował się nią straumatyzowany maturzysta, Sławek Dębski, mieszkający z rodzicami w Radziechowach, w dawnym domu Bresiów. Powołując się na wieści od dziwnego informatora, nie tylko zaczyna nachodzić sąsiada, Marcina Bresia, ale również dzieli się swoimi podejrzeniami z kolegami, wśród których jest autor kryminalnych podcastów, Julian Kliś. Gdy będący na granicy szaleństwa Sławek znika, w sprawę włącza się z konieczności policja, a po odkryciu płytkiego grobu, w którym obok zwłok Dębskiego są również ludzkie szczątki sprzed lat, wdrożone zostaje oficjalne śledztwo.Policyjnym dochodzeniem zajmuje się aspirant Jakub Wójcik, ale główny punkt ciężkości przesuwa autorka w powieści na rodziny i znajomych ofiar. W pierwszym rzędzie jest to trójka dzieci Bresiów, których życie poznajemy w specyficznie dobranych szczegółach, łącznie z na nowo pobudzonymi traumami z dzieciństwa. Czy także z nadziejami na odkrycie wszystkich sekretów z przeszłości? Jakie znaczenie miała już wówczas, trzydzieści lat temu, niedoskonałość pamięci dwojga starszych dzieci? Skąd się wziął obecnie wskrzeszony motyw tzw. trzeciej osoby?W pewnym momencie wydaje się, że jeśli nie aspirant Wójcik, to jedyną osobą predestynowaną do rozwiązania zagadki śmierci zarówno Sławka Dębskiego jak i małżeństwa Bresiów jest ich najmłodszy syn, Mati. Ale dlaczego autorka dużo uwagi poświęca, na przykład, również rodzicom, szczególnie matce Sławka i babci Bresiowej czy choćby wysiłkom Matiego, aby dotrzeć do przyjaciółki matki, Eweliny, oraz do dziewczyny Sławka, Karoliny, i jego kolegi, Juliana?W czytanych wcześniej przeze mnie kryminałach i thrillerach Anny Kańtoch doceniałam jej sposób narracji, ale nie potrafiłam się wciągnąć w kreowane przez nią klimaty. Natomiast atmosferę „Trzeciej osoby” zaakceptowałam w całości, mimo dość osobliwego zakończenia. Na pewno przyczyniła się do tego sceneria wydarzeń i interpretacja audiobooka przez Andrzeja Hausnera."

Viimeinen vääntö,Seppo Jokinen,3.85,"Olipas tunteellista ja haikeaa lukea Jokisen kirjaa tällä kertaa, kauniisti vedettiin yhteen kaikkia kuluneita vuosia, joita itsekin olen viettänyt Koskisen seurassa. Eläköityvä rikoskomisario katselee tulevaan uusia suuntia pohtien - uusia dekkarisarjoja täytyy näköjään löytää tämän lempparini tilalle minunkin.","Saa nähdä jääkö tämä todella Jokisen viimeiseksi Koskiseksi. Niin kaihoisia Koskisfanit ainakin Bookbeatissa näyttävät olevan, että epäillä sopii.Viimeinen vääntö on taattua Jokista ja Koskista hyvässä ja vähemmän hyvässä. Kirjan alku on suorastaan vetelää kun Koskinen on lomilla eikä muut Tampereen poliisit saa mitään aikaan. Mutta kunhan Koskinen palaa pariksi viikoksi töihin, kaikki solmut aukeavat tämän empaattisen poliisin aivoituksilla. Uskottavaa? No ei, mutta ei kai viihteen tarvitse sitä ollakaan. Ymmärrän kyllä niitä jotka ovat tykästyneet Koskisen nukkavieruun ja omapäiseen hahmoon. Turhan samankaltaisina nämä Koskisen kiemurat toistuvat, vain Koskinen ymmärtää konnia ja ihmisiä. Tampereella on nyt vakava paikka. Tämän kirjan perusteella sikäläiset poliisit eivät Koskisen eläköidyttyä tulee saamaan yhtään rikosta ratkottua. Siitä neljä tähteä!","Tuntuu haikealta ajatella, että sarja on tullut päätökseensä. Olen iloinen, että Koskisen edesottamuksia on saanut seurata näinkin pitkään. Näiden hahmojen seurassa on saanut viettää lukuiset tunnit, seurata Tampereen kehittymistä ja ratkaista muutaman rikoksenkin. Ajoittain hieman hämmensi, miten toimintakyvyttömiksi muut itsensä laskivat Koskisen eläköityessä. Sakarin ja Raijan lopputulema oli minulle erittäin mieleinen. Hieno dekkarisarja. Hankala arvioida tätä ”puolueettomasti” täysin omana yksilönään, ehkä hieman joitain osia heikompi. Erittäin mainio dekkari silti."
What About the Bodies: A Novel,Ken Jaworowski,3.86,The first 80% was outstanding; the final 20% was very disappointing. It ends on an extremely depressing note.A MORE DETAILED REVIEW WILL BE FORTHCOMING LATER.Thanks to Grove Atlantic for providing an electronic copy of this book via NetGalley. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinions.,"I received a free copy of, What About the Bodies, by Ken Jaworowski, from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Liz, Reed, and Carla, all have their secrets and reasons for doing things, right or wrong, morally or immorally. I did not care for any of the characters in this book at all. It was a gritty read.","What separates this from a slew of other crime fiction is that the crimes (or incidents) occur in a small town, are not criminal in intent, and involve characters far removed from the typical perpetrators/participants. All three of the major characters fell into their current situations and conceal their secrets, as revealing them would most likely find them accused and imprisoned. WHAT ABOUT THE BODIES is about what happens when unpleasant things occur in a small town in Central Pennsylvania where everybody seems to know almost everybody else. Along with the suspense that crime novels provide, there is an endearing slice-of-life memoir to give this so much flavor. Helped along by rotating first-person narratives from the three main characters, their paths cross before things come to a satisfying conclusion. Also, unlike many tales of crime fiction that seem to head down a dark path, this one manages to keep its head above water and not descend into despair. The ending is completely satisfactory, although unexpected and not predictable. A very entertaining read. Thanks for Net Galley for providing an advanced digital review copy."
The City Without Saints: The Orphan Boy,D.S. Coellar,0.00,NA,NA,NA
Dead Manor,A.M. Rau,4.40,"Mysterious story that I truly enjoyed. This was the first that I’ve read from this author but certainly won’t be my last. Newly promoted detective Darren Clovis is determined to prove himself and prove that he deserves this chance within the department. Investigating a serial killer, he jumps into this case head first. His investigation took many twists and turns that kept me interested & intrigued the entire time. The dual POVs were excellent, it is always good to hear the views of the killer as well as the person investigating them. This story was suspenseful, and the premise set was addictive. I love that A. M. Rau sets the ending up for a book 2. Overall a great read that I recommend","“Dead Manor” is my first book by author A.M. Rau. I enjoyed the dual PoV that the story was told from. It helped get some backstory of the mystery part of the story as it was a short read to begin with. There was a bit of suspense in some weird events throughout the story that I appreciate as thrillers/mystery/suspense are the kind of stories I like to read typically. The relationship between Darren and his wife, Clara, was realistic, and added a nice element to an otherwise intense story. My favorite part was the incorporation of Greek mythology because it is an interest of mine. Overall, I enjoyed the story and would recommend it to others who like detective thrillers. > I received an ARC of the book in exchange for a review.","Detective Darren got the job he wanted after workin in the force for 15 years. Now, he is a cold case detective and has set hours so he can spend more time with his wife Clara, the therapist. When Darren comes across a cold case that has the same MO as the Greek mythology, the Andromeda he has to try to solve them all with some help from the senior detective Jim. Clara and Darren's banter is adorable. This book is a very good detective book lookin for a serial unaliver it keeps u guessin til the end. This book leaves on a cliffhanger. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
The God of the Woods,Liz    Moore,4.14,"I think I want to grade, define, declare, and devour this book beyond terms and genres because no other words can weigh my thoughts and adoration! Ladies and gentlemen who appreciate great literature, this book is for us! It is the cure to my depressed soul, restless every July, searching for a good book and often frustrated, finally finding a fountain in the middle of the Sahara! This book is my Bellagio fountain, and I can drink till I burst! This is a great combination of historical fiction, mystery, crime thriller, and women's fiction with multiple perspectives taking us on a tour through time zones, wandering around the minds of very different characters, seeing the world from their points of view. The story focuses on 17-year-old Barbara Van Laar, a rebellious, artsy, punk-styled outcast who vanishes from her family’s camp in the Adirondacks in August 1975. Barbara is the only remaining child of the town’s wealthy Van Laar family and the second missing child of the family after her brother Bear disappeared at the age of 8, before she was born. This left behind a psychologically damaged mother, Alice, who is a pill and alcohol addict, a workaholic authoritarian father, Peter, a harsh, relentless grandfather, and his mostly silent, obedient wife. The entire family maintains appearances, giving their social circle and business connections more importance than showing affection to each other. But Barbara’s vanishing opens up a can of worms, revealing big secrets connected to Bear’s disappearance a decade ago. Did the family wrongly accuse someone for the crime even though they hadn’t found the body? Did the same person take the second child of the family? Is the perpetrator a runaway inmate accused of being a serial killer of several women? Or a scary woman turned into an urban legend lurking around the woods? Or is someone in the camp involved in the crime with a secret partner? There are several perspectives in this book you can easily connect with, including:Tracy: a quirky, meek, outcast girl who suffers from her parents’ abrupt breakup, sent to a youth summer camp belonging to the powerful Van Laar family, admiring Barbara’s straightforward, confident attributes, becoming friends and confidantes with her.Alice: the mentally disturbed, pill-addict mother of Barbara, still trying to connect with her lost son, cutting away her connection with the real world for her own reasons, her unhappy marriage and related issues. Louise: a 26-year-old camp counselor, trying to take care of her young brother, dealing with her depressed, irresponsible mother, working hard to put a roof over their heads. She is wrongly framed for Barbara’s disappearance by trusting the wrong people, about to be a victim of financial inequality and injustice. Limb Jacob: who is faking his limp as a disability, escaping from prison as if he is a convicted serial killer, having quiet wild life skills to survive in the woods, hiding in the cabins without getting noticed.Carl Stoddard: a gardener of the Preserve, taking the job five years ago to afford the expenses of his sick son who couldn’t make it in the end, suffering from his own health issues, finding himself in inappropriate circumstances during Bear’s disappearance. Judyta Luptack: born in Schenectady, a former first-class female national trooper of Albany, first female investigator at the state at the age of 26, still cannot tell her crowded, traditional family she has to move to her own place instead of getting up at the crack of dawn to make it to her job on time, driving sleeplessly on her way back home. She’s smart, enthusiastic, observant, knowing mansplaining at the workplace firsthand but still doing her best to piece together the puzzle to merge two missing persons’ cases which point fingers at the Van Laar family! This book is one of the best inspirational women power books, telling unique stories of different women who use their own ways to survive and protect their loved ones. T.J., the camp director, is a tough, self-sufficient, resilient character who runs the place without taking any nonsense, even from the Van Laar family. Louise is an abuse victim, overachiever raising her own brother like her own son. Judyta is an idealistic crime fighter using her wits and logic to see what others cannot decipher. Alice is trying to find her place in the world of the rich, getting lost each day in her own losses, numbing herself into oblivion. The stories, the portraits, the travel between timelines are perfectly developed, and the conclusion with several twists and surprises is fairly wrapped up! I enjoyed this book so, so, so, so much! I advise you to read it, read it, and read it! It’s freaking one of the best books of the year! Whatever category it will compete in at the Goodreads Choice Awards, I’ll give my vote without thinking!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter","Okay, lots of thoughts on this one. Going to try to unpack them all here.The God of the Woods starts out really well. I found the beginning to be compelling, with lots of interesting characters and perspectives. But then as the investigation into Barbara's disappearance heats up, a few things started to really bother me, and it went a bit downhill from there.When it comes to verbosity in a book, readers generally fall into two camps. For some, if they love a story, then stretching it out an extra hundred pages by filling it with lots of beautiful writing but no additional content makes it even better. But for me, my motto is always shorter is better, and fluffing it out to pad the page count doesn't do it for me. So you see where I'm going with this.What starts out as compelling quickly turns meandering for me. The longer the story went on, the more unfocused it seemed. There are a lot of perspectives in here—I count seven—and every time something was about to happen, we immediately switched to a different perspective, effectively losing the momentum. And when we come back to the original one, the exciting scene had already happened off-page and it's mostly glossed over.But it isn't just the perspectives, which I honestly don't mind that much. It's also how unnecessarily convoluted the mystery was, in large part due to the way it was written. Every time the police needed to talk to a witness, that person would inevitably end up missing. So we would have to spend time tracking them down just to have a conversation with them. In addition to the two disappearances which are central to this story, I counted no less than six other characters who disappeared at one time or another. It was exhausting.Surely though, once these witnesses are found, they would be able to answer some simple questions, right? Well, no. Everyone in here lied every chance they had, often for no reason that I could discern and against their best interests. It felt like drama for drama's sake, making the mystery feel even more tortuous and chaotic. You know, just in case the reader thought it was too easy or there weren't enough pages in this book.My other big issue is that the author has a real knack for writing dumb female characters. It drove me a bit nuts in Long Bright River and here it is again. This time, we have Alice and Louise, two of our main characters, both being portrayed as spineless fools. You guys know I love my female characters to be strong and smart, so to have to read about women who let people walk all over them while making one bad decision after another got old real quick.Then after all of that (almost 500 pages), this mystery had to be one of the most unsatisfying I've ever come across. Clues were laid out seemingly to point to one direction or another, but then the story disregards almost everything it had said before and ends on something completely different. And some of the clues were never addressed at all, as if they've served their purpose to mislead us and now we can just forget about them.Still, for all my complaints, I did find this to be a fairly engrossing read. There were many moments I got really into it, and the pages just melted away. But there were also many moments where I could not believe yet another character has disappeared or Alice and Louise are yet again being dumb and weak, and I could just feel my eyeballs rolling around in exasperation.Clearly I'm in the minority here. Everyone else is loving this, so you shouldn't take what I say too seriously. Sometimes there is just a mismatch between a reader and a book, and that's probably what happened here.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Long Bright River~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧✧ This was a pick for my BOTM box.

Let her be lost; let all of them be lost, actually. I'll just go take a nap at one of the other cabins."
Nightshade,Michael    Connelly,4.27,"HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY! 🎉✨📚As a dedicated fan of Michael Connelly, I eagerly anticipate each new release, and “Nightshade” certainly did not disappoint! It marks the intriguing start of a brand-new series, introducing us to a fresh protagonist rather than the familiar faces we've come to know and love.Meet County Sheriff Detective Stilwell, known as 'Stil.' After navigating difficulties on the mainland, he arrives on the picturesque Catalina Island, a transition that initially raises some doubts. However, it doesn't take long for him to be captivated by the island's allure and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead, including a blossoming romance. Just as life seems to be taking a turn for the better, tragedy strikes—when a resident discovers a young woman's body, weighed down in the harbour.What follows is a gripping investigation that forces Stil to confront his past as he collaborates with mainland colleagues with whom he has a tumultuous history. As he digs deeper, the dark undercurrents of the island begin to surface, revealing a side completely at odds with its serene facade.True to Connelly’s masterful style, the narrative unfolds steadily, initially laying the groundwork for establishing this new series. But make no mistake—the journey is as dark, gritty and captivating as ever, keeping readers hooked from start to finish. Stilwell is a richly developed character who is fiercely independent and unwavering in pursuing the truth, no matter the personal cost. Watching him adapt to his new surroundings and their impact on those around him is truly fascinating.The island plays a vital role, almost like a character in its own right, adding depth and atmosphere to the storyline. Connelly also disperses clever nods to his previous works, rooting this tale within the same timeline. He could easily set up Detective Stilwell for thrilling future crossovers with the existing characters from Connelly’s other series. A girl could hope!!! With this new character, Detective Stilwell, leading the charge, Connelly proves once again that he is a powerhouse in the Police procedural thriller genre, and it’s exhilarating to add another must-read novel to his impressive collection! I will anxiously be awaiting the next book in the series.I highly recommend this for fans of Police procedurals, thrillers and character-driven plot-driven storylines.Thank you to Orion Publishing Group and Netgalley for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. I was under no obligation to provide a review.PRE-READ Thank you to Orion Publishing Group for the opportunity to read and review an ARC of ""Nightshade."" As a long-time fan of Michael Connelly, a master of police procedurals, I have always enjoyed the exciting journeys that come with his popular character, Harry Bosch. This time, I am thrilled to embark on a new adventure with Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Detective Stilwell—an intriguing character in his own right.","Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, and I’ve read all of his books. He creates really well developed characters and the plots are always twisty yet believable. When I started reading Nightshade, I wondered if Connelly had really written it, or whether he was farming out books as so many well-known authors have done. It’s a new series, but I found it confusing that so many characters were introduced initially, along with a lot of unfamiliar boating terms, and the buffalo mutilation was beyond horrifying. As with many of Connelly’s protagonists, Stilwell is something of a loner, with another officer in the department who strongly dislikes him. I was disappointed that I never really connected with Stilwell or any other character, something that has never happened before when reading a Connelly novel. I will definitely be interested to see what’s next in this series, but honestly at this point I’d rather read another Ballard, Bosch, or Haller story. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the ARC.","I’ll be honest and declare upfront that when I started reading this book, I assumed it was to be a tale featuring Connelly’s current major characters, Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard. It took me a while to discover that neither was to feature this time around. Instead, he’s introduced a new detective to his collection: Stilwell – known to his friends as Stil, and to at least one non-friend as Stilborn. Stil is based on Catalina Island, one of California’s Channel Islands, about an hour’s ferry ride from Los Angeles. It’s a posting synonymous with being ‘put out to grass’. This follows a fallout with a fellow detective on the mainland. He’s serving penance, but beginning to think that this place may actually be somewhere he’d like to stay. He has a burgeoning relationship with a woman he really likes, and maybe even loves, and the place just seems to suit him.Then, a body is discovered in the harbour. It's been tied to an anchor and lies below the surface of the water. It’s an inconvenient time, as the harbour is about to become a busy place - this weekend being one on which many visitors are scheduled to arrive, quite a few with their own boats. Stil knows that the murder – which this obviously is – will be investigated by a team from the mainland. But would you believe it, the lead detective assigned is the very man Stil has an issue with - the man whose actions, and Stil's reaction to them, resulted in his current posting.The story follows Stilwell’s increasingly unwanted (by the lead detective and their joint boss) meddling in the investigation, together with his progressively complicated and often confrontational relationships with just about everyone he comes into contact with. It’s really great fun, and as the tale played out, I was to find myself increasing drawn to yet another of Connelly’s principled and charismatic characters.For Bosch it’s: everybody counts or nobody countsFor Stilwell it’s: the sacred bond between the victim and those charged with finding justiceYes, Stil has elements of Bosch about him – as does Ballard – but he’s different enough, and the setting is different enough to make it all feel new and fresh. I’m definitely looking forward to meeting up with Stilwell again.My thanks to Orion Publishing Group for supplying a copy of this book via NetGalley in return for an honest review"
Local Woman Missing,Mary Kubica,4.13,"Once again, here I am, an outlier. Most of my friends here enjoyed it, but I did not.First the positives: I loved the beginning. Sorry, that's it, there's only one positive that I can come up with.Now the negatives:If I listed all the implausible actions, reactions, events, scenarios, and conclusions I would re-write the entire book. I can’t give details as they would be spoilers.BUT, the physician who performs an autopsy on a victim is a complete moron to miss obvious signs that it didn't happen the way he said it did. A CHILD could have seen what he missed.A police officer hides a key piece of evidence, but since when is only ONE PERSON in an entire department privy to a key piece of evidence in a very high profile case (or any case)? It made me laugh, but it was supposed to be serious. Sorry.When I found out what happened to the missing women my eyes practically rolled out of my head.And the ending, all tied up in a pretty bow, with a character who has been severely traumatized for YEARS (given the location, that it had been going on for years without detection was laughably ridiculous) goes on to live a completely normal and happy life as if nothing had happened. Plus, the scenes with the OB/GYN had no bearing on the story at all. It was an opportunity for the author to further a personal agenda and lecture us and I didn’t like it.BUT, the worst offense was the writing style. I haven’t seen a reviewer mention this yet, so I’ll be the first. It drove me crazy! Does anyone remember the primers for first graders (yes, I'm old): “See Dick. See Dick run. See Jane. See Jane run”.Yeah, that’s what we have here. Keep in mind I read an ARC but a friend who read the published copy confirmed the writing. A few examples:It’s Bea’s birthday. Today Bea is thirty years old. They came to celebrate.”“Bea makes dinner for Leo and me. She lets Leo help. They make pasta. Bea serves it with milk.”“Kate and Bea are opposites. Kate is conventional. Bea is not. Kate doesn’t stand out the way that Bea does. Bea is arresting.”Has she or the editor ever heard of conjunctions?! There are many more examples (the whole book).I’m in the minority, so do check out the 4 & 5 star reviews, but for me, it's a very generous 2 stars. •	I received a digital copy via Edelweiss. All opinions are my own","I knew I Shouldn’t Have Read This! Local Woman Missing is about two missing women who went missing from an affluent neighborhood 11 years ago. In the present, a teenage girl who has escaped from captivity has a startling connection to the missing women.Narrated by Kate, Meredith, and Leo, I found all characters boring.  Leo was more interesting than the other two, but I never understood the purpose of having him serve as a narrator. If narrated by other characters, this could have been more interesting. I would have loved to have read the point of view of the villain and the little girl. Also, Shelby's character had so many underdeveloped angles that would have made for fascinating reading. Instead, we got boring, boring, and what’s the point. The first 80% was decent but a little boring. I wasn’t fully enthralled, but I was interested in knowing what was really going on. It was a solid 4-star read, and then I got to the twists. With each twist, my star rating went down. My reaction to each twist:Twist One: Ugh! Seriously? All of this because of that?Twist Two: Shaking my head. This is just stupid.Twist Three: Laugh out loud ridiculous! In addition to the twists spiraling out of control and into a level of implausibility, storylines were dropped, creating plot holes, leaving me with many unanswered questions.In the end, the twists undid this book for me in more ways than one.","DNF - The writing style is not for me. The sentence structure is so simple, yet the content is overly dramatic and irrelevantly descriptive.Here is the exact scene when I realized this book is not for me: The doorbell rings. It takes the character two whole pages (ten paragraphs) to walk over and open the door. In the meantime, we are treated to musings on the weather, how the apocalypse is coming because it's raining so much, how they should build an ark, how she went to church to confess just in case the world is ending, how her blood is running cold with fear at the thought of someone at the door, and how her partner isn't around to open the door for her. Then she finally opens the door and it's just her neighbor.I'm exhausted from that scene and we haven't even gotten to the good stuff yet. I toughed it out for a few more chapters after that, but it's pretty much the same. So I'm going to call it and move on.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
You Killed Me First,John Marrs,4.01,"okay i am SO torn on what to rate this one! overall, i enjoyed myself. like most John Marrs books, lots of twists and turns, you have no idea what is true up until the last page, but i was confused for a lot of this. especially reading it over the course of 3-4 days, i kept having to re-read the last chapter to remember where i was at and what was going on. but like i said, i enjoyed myself! a 3 feels right hahaha",Well that was fun as hell. I had a little bit of difficulty keeping all the characters/POVs straight but this was a wild ride I enjoyed very much,"HA, These women are a HOT DIABOLICAL MESS!!!!!!Mr. Marrs is back with his addictive thrillers and in this book, we are following three women who all have deep rooted secrets, enough to kill. The book starts off immediately into the action involving a woman who has been bound and gagged and is trapped in the heart of a towering bonfire. She has no idea what she has done and neither do we.Going back eleven months we are introduced to three women, Margot, Anna and Liv. Margot and Anna have been friends for years and Liv moving into the neighborhood befriends the two women but under all the niceties you can tell these women simply don’t F&ck with one another and ensues a whole bunch of chaos and drama! I never thought I’d see the day where I would add the word ‘FUN’ in Mr. Marrs books, but here we are. This book was so juicy, entertaining and FUN! Of course, he adds his elements of extreme twists and turns, but I really enjoyed reading along to the absolute cattiness of these three women. I could not put this book down and I promise you it definitely gives ‘Just one more chapter’ vibes. I read it in one sitting! The book is told in three POVS of the ladies and then we also get anonymous POVS of additional characters who completely had me scratching my head in utter confusion because I didn’t understand who the hell they were and how they correlated to the story, and it felt like they were just talking in cryptic code or something… BUT!!!!!!! When the realization hits of what it all meant… IT HITS! I was preparing to knock one star off because I just didn’t get those chapters, but afterwards I realized just how wonderfully and cleverly it was done. Bravo Mr. Marrs! The aftermath had me grabbing my invisible pearls and I was excited to see how it would all conclude. The ending had me GAGGED! (excuse the pun) ⋆｡°✩WHAT I LIKED⋆｡°✩➽ Unlikeable characters➽ Short chapters➽ Dark humour➽ Wild twists➽ The ""darker"" chapters➽ The ending⋆｡°✩WHAT I DIDNT LIKE⋆｡°✩➽ The anonymous POVS (at first)➽ Having to wait till halfway through the book for the first twist An absolute wild thrilling ride was had with this one and dare I say Marrs has entered his popcorn thriller era with a BANG! I’m already ready for your next book John… Please don’t keep me waiting for too long! 4.5 ⭐----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩Its finally here!!!!!!!!!!!🥳🥳This man can do no wrong in my eyes!

Three Mothers,Hannah Beckerman,4.14,"Five for three!Yes, five shining stars for ""Three Mothers"".I was absolutely, positively transfixed by this emotionally jolting, character-driven, compelling, and gripping domestic suspense novel.Unfolding from the POVs of three mothers, the story recounts the devastating aftermath of a teen girl's hit-and-run death in an affluent London suburb.I listened to the audiobook, expertly narrated by Kristin Atherton.I almost always prefer three narrators when a book unfolds from three POVs, but Kristin Atherton did an outstanding job with the narration and pulled it off with flying colors.All the stars!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","Three mothers: Abby, whose daughter Isla is killed in a tragic hit and run. Nicole, Abby's best friend whose son Nathaniel has long had feelings for Isla. Jenna, mother of Callum, Isla's ex-boyfriend. Through multiple perspectives, the truth behind Isla's death is revealed.I was hooked on this book from the first chapter, zipping through the whole thing in a day. The shorter chapters, and multiple perspectives and timelines kept things interesting. I had multiple guesses at what happened, but the ending was unpredictable and satisfying. This was a tough read at times with several sensitive topics, but I enjoyed the themes of forgiveness and love. This was my second read by this author and will definitely look forward to more.","3.5*I liked this book, but I didn't love it.I guessed the truth in about 10%, but what I did like, was the more secrets that were revealed, the more I doubted my initial theory, and then eventually got to ""aha I knew it!"".One of the revealed secrets made me feel a bit queasy, but that's just good writing.Got this is as my Amazon first reads for the month, and glad I did else I'm not sure I'd have stumbled across this book. Will look to read more by this author in the future."
In Cold Blood,Truman Capote,4.09,"""How much money did you get from the Clutters?""""Between forty and fifty dollars.""

Paroled: 7-6-59.As I write this review, I'm sitting about 60 miles from the Clutter house in Holcomb, Kansas. Holcomb is a small, farming community located just west of Garden City. This is a place where everyone in the whole county not only knows your name, but also has a working knowledge of your family history going back fifty plus years. I usually avoid reading true crime books. I don't want my head filled with tragedy. I want to go about my life with a degree of caution, but not be ruled by the fear I feel such books will instill. I picked up a copy of this book at the Dodge City Library. The librarian at the check out desk, a woman about mid-sixties, slender, elegant, and still attractive ran her finger along the edge of the spine. I noticed a shiver had rolled up her back and rippled her shoulders. She looked up at me with pinched blue eyes and said in a whisper, ""I remember when this happened"". She watched her father put locks on the doors for the first time. The murders became a demarcation line in her life there was life before the Clutter murders, and then there was life after the Clutter murders. Her response surprised me. We live in a time when any crime anywhere in the country is broadcast out to the nation and something tragic that happens in Illinois or in Virginia or Alaska impacts our lives. I would have thought over time some of the significance of the Clutter murder would have been buried under the avalanche of murder and mayhem that the news cycle brings us 24/7. For this community and for all the small communities dotting the map of Kansas, and even in the surrounding states, this was something that wasn't supposed to happen in a small town. This was big city crime that happened in their own backyard. As I talked to people about the Clutter murders most everybody had some kind of physical reaction. They flinched as if they were dodging a blow or took a step back from me or developed a twitch along their jawline. Their eyes gazed through me or beyond me as the fears and anxieties of 1959 came flooding back into their mind. Most of them attributed more deaths to the crime, each of them citing six deaths rather than four. I'm sure they remembered that there was six family members, but two older girls had already left the home to start their own lives. They were not present on that fateful night when their family was murdered. In Cold Blood was required reading in many schools in this region clear up until about the 1970s, so even people who were too young to remember the crime have experienced the tragedy through Truman Capote. In the description above regarding Perry Edward Smith there is a reference to Phillips County. This has special significance for me because I was born and raised in Phillips County. The family farm is located in Phillips County. My Father and I graduated from Phillipsburg High School. My Dad was a sophomore in high school in 1955 when Perry Smith decided to burglarize the Chandler Sales Company in Phillipsburg, Kansas and this seemingly insignificant act was really the beginning of this story. Smith and his accomplice, also Smith, stole typewriters, adding machines etc and left town with their ill gotten goods in the backseat of the car. Later they ignored a traffic signal in St. Joseph, Missouri and were pulled over by a police officer. The cop was very interested in what was in their backseat. They were extradited back to Phillipsburg, where through an open window (imagine my embarrassment for the law enforcement of my home county) they escaped. Later Perry was caught again and sent back to Phillipsburg where the law enforcement fortunately did a much better job of keeping track of him. Perry Smith received 10 years in the Kansas Penitentiary in Leavenworth. Richard Eugene Hickock was already serving time in Leavenworth for fraud. The two met and became friends. The final piece to the puzzle that not only determined the fate of the Clutter family, but also the fates of Smith and Hickock was snapped down in place when they meet Floyd Wells. Wells, serving time for some bit of stupidity, had worked for Herb Clutter back in 1948. He told Hickock and Smith that Clutter was a wealthy farmer, and kept a safe full of cash in his house. Wells was absolutely full of shit. There was no safe. There was no pile of cash. There was absolutely no reason for four people to lose their lives for $40. 

After the murders they went to Mexico for a while, but even though they could live cheaply down South the money still trickled through their fingers. After they burned through the goods they had acquired through the Clutter robbery and through defrauding a series of retail stores, they found that working in Mexico didn't pay well either. They came back up to the United States and there was this baffling moment where Perry Smith is reading the paper and sees an article about a family that was tied up and shot to death. ""Amazing!"" Perry glanced through the article again. ""Know what I wouldn't be surprised? If this wasn't done by a lunatic. Some nut that read about what happened out in Kansas."" WTF? Some nut? How about the original coconut heads that murdered the family in Kansas? Perry does have a moment or two where he weighs what happened in Kansas. ""Know what I think?"" said Perry. ""I think there must be something wrong with us. To do what we did.""""Did what?""""Out there.""""Deal me out, baby,"" Dick said. ""I'm a normal.""Truman Capote had been looking for the right story for an experimental form of writing he'd been considering trying. He wanted to blend fiction and nonfiction. The Clutter murders struck him as the perfect story to launch this new form of writing. I have to admire his fortitude, for a man of his sensibilities not only spending that much time among farmbillies, but having to befriend them as well. It must have been somewhat of a painful experience. 

Capote in the Clutter homeFloyd Wells eventually comes forward and tells what he knows about the murders. He had always liked Herb Clutter and felt ashamed that what he had told, in a moment of prison bonding, had led to such a vicious conclusion. Without his statement I'm pretty sure that Smith and Hickock would have gotten away with the murders. The slender evidence tying them to the murders would have made it almost impossible to prosecute them. Their sentencing can have only one conclusion...death. As they are being led back to their cells:Smith says to Hickock, ""No chicken-hearted jurors, they!"" They both laughed loudly, and a cameraman photographed them. The picture appeared in a Kansas paper above a caption entitled: ""The Last Laugh?""When I consider their bravado the last vestiges of any sympathy I may have been harboring for their plight dissipated. This is a beautifully written book. I want to thank Harper Lee for her role in helping Capote bring this book to completion. I'm not sure Capote would have had the perseverance to see it through without her holding his hand. I was surprised about how many connections I have to the events in this book many of which I had no idea until I read them in the book for the first time. I was long overdue to read this book and this experience has certainly convinced me to add more of the classic True Crime genre to my reading queue. This book is legendary not only because of the heinous nature of the crime, but also because Capote was ushering in a new way to tell a story. If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten","I just wonder why it took me so long to get this masterpiece on my currently-reading shelf. What a breathtaking story! And told in the most amazing novelistic style! The cold-blooded murders in Kansas in 1956 are described by a cold, distant narrator via the interviews of the family, acquaintances, and community around the victims and the hair-raising stories of Perry and Bobby, the murderers. It is a real page-turner - I couldn't put it down! The descriptions of the youth of all the tragic protagonists are explored from every angle under a magnifying glass. In Cold Blood kept me thinking that most of the recent murder mystery shows and movies were indebted to this piece of literature (that Capote probably deserved a Pulitzer for but was passed over, helas, in 1965). There is this strange homoeroticism between the two murderers (who call each other ""sugar"" and ""honey"") but who both spout homophobic words throughout. Like the lawyers, I felt Richard was the coldest one and Perry the most twisted and tragic. This book is a true masterpiece of the non-fiction novel (even if some of the facts brought out by Capote were disputed) and its narration is stupendous in character development and maintains an enormous amount of suspense end-to-end. It is even more astounding because the reader already knows who commits the crime, the novel only elucidates the ""why"" and even that is ambiguous and pathetic. An awesome read.Note that in A Capote Reader, there is a great short essay about the making of the movie In Cold Blood where Capote talks a bit about the 6 years it took him to write this masterpiece. (Haven't seen the movie yet :/)[UPDATE] I finally saw the movie Capote and it was absolutely amazing as a backstory to this book. I still haven't found the movie In Cold Blood yet.","This story made a huge impact on my life. There were six of us kids and come summer my mother couldn't handle all of us so she farmed me out every year to the aunts. One aunt lived in Indio. My mother put me on a Greyhound bus and nine years old; all alone with my brown paper grocery bag as luggage. I was scared to death. A Seagull hit the expansive windshield with splat of blood and feathers. Unfazed the driver merely turned on the windshield wipers and made and even bigger mess.I arrived in Indio a hundred plus degrees and my aunt Carol picked me up at the bus station. She said she was taking me and my cousin Danny to the movies. Oh, boy I loved the movies. We stopped at a store to pick up some candy and I bought my favorite Chicken-O-stick. I was nine my cousin was seven, she bought our tickets at The Aztec theater and ushered us through the door. She said she'd be back when the movie was over. It was nice to be out of the sweltering heat. We sat down ate our candy in great anticipation. The movie started and it was in black and white. It was In Cold Blood, not something a nine year old should be watching.Ten years later my cousin Danny and my Aunt Carol would be arrested for killing my favorite uncle Don in a murder for hire. My aunt hired a hit man out of Orange County named Cornelius. They stiffed in a fake call of an emergency at the Metropolitan Water Distinct where my uncle worked. There was a clause in the life insurance policy that if he died at work it was double indemnity. My uncle showed up in the middle of the night and they shot him in the back of the head. Of course there is lots more to this true story.And to this day I can not forget In Cold Blood, the movie.Sorry for the rant this was supposed to be a book review.David Putnam Author of the Bruno Johnson series."
The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland (Translator)",4.24,"These books really shouldn't work. Stieg Larsson is a very weird writer. He likes to tell us absolutely everything someone is doing. If Stieg wrote the story of my morning, it would go like this:""Joel woke up around 7:45 a.m. and looked at the clock. He decided he didn't need to get up yet and hit the snooze button. When the alarm sounded again, he dragged himself out of bed and used the toilet. He brushed his teeth and then dressed in a blue striped shirt, black tie and flat front dress slacks he'd purchased on sale at Kohl's. He made himself a cup of coffee, fired up his 13-inch Macbook laptop and checked his email. He had 14 messages. 11 of them were advertisements from various mailing lists or spam emails encouraging him to enlarge his penis. One message was from his mother and two more were shipping notices for books he'd purchased from Amazon.com. He read the note from his mother but decided to reply later. He then deleted all the messages but the two from Amazon and closed his laptop. He sat on the couch and stared into space, drinking his coffee and thinking.""Most writers would probably start the scene several paragraphs later, when I finally get to work (that's where the real excitement happens! I check even MORE email!). (Plus it turns out I'm not even a main character.) But for some reason, this style is, I don't know, endearing instead of annoying. I love the way he tells us every time Mikael has a cigarette or what he likes on his sandwiches. And hey, at least I know what brand of cell phone everyone is using.It's kind of weird how the series wound up being not at all what I was expecting. Book one was closest, a serial killer story that was nevertheless a weird mash-up of political potboiler and are-the-lambs-screaming-Clarice murder fun. But then book two was mostly about the internal politics of the Swedish police and media industries. And the big climax of the trilogy comes down to an incredibly extended legal thriller, Grisham-style. I assume. I've never read a John Grisham book.But really, everyone knows why the books work, and it's because of the characters. Stieg approached the whole trilogy as a sort of manifesto about the injustices heaped upon women in Swedish society, and illustrates them via a host of compelling, level-headed, fairly well-rounded women who are fun to read about even when they spend every other page having sex with the Stieg stand-in. Everyone loves Lisbeth, of course, and this installment does a good job of fleshing out her back story and explaining how exactly one winds up a tattooed, antisocial computer-hacking genius with an insatiable hunger for revenge and Billy's pan pizza.This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. I don't read legal thrillers but I love courtroom scenes in movies, especially when judges say stuff like ""I'm going to allow it, but you'd better be going somewhere with this."" No one says that here, but only because apparently you can do whatever the fuck you want in a Swedish courtroom without bothering to talk to the judge at all. On the bright side, a flustered prosecutor does break out another old chestnut --""This is highly irregular!"" -- that almost makes up for it.So, yeah, I'm a little sad that Lisbeth has stalked off to that big Ikea-furnished apartment in the sky to join her creator. And I wish Stieg didn't eat quite so many of the fatty sandwiches and Billy's pan pizzas he loved detailing so much (hey, write what you know). If book 4 never emerges from that mythical laptop, though, this is a pretty good place to end things.","What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	You can use duct tapes to close up serious wounds; they keep the blood in and the germs out.2.	You can be shot in the head and STILL have photographic memory, though annoyingly, you will forget the solution to that pesky Fermat's Theorem that you have just discovered.3.	Congenital analgesia is a useful condition to have for mafia henchmen and Bond villains.4.	Muscular, one meter eighty-four tall Latina policewomen who can out-wrestle a man are HOT.5.	Middle-aged, out of shape Swedish journalists are powerful chick magnets.6.	Threesomes and other bedroom antics involving leather, especially if you are stupid enough to record them, WILL come back to haunt you.7.	“Statistics showed that the absolute majority of people who harassed women were men.” Yes, we know it, that barring a few notable exceptions, most men are SADISTIC PIGS, PERVERTS AND RAPISTS!8.	”The majority of poison pen artists were either teenagers or the middle-aged.” Only people between 26 and 54 years of age are crazy enough to become stalkers.9.	Amazons are cool because they were willing to cut off their right breasts to be better archers. They also liked to copulate with random men to make babies.10.	Meatballs with potatoes and Lingonberry sauce are good Swedish food.BUT SERIOUSLY,this final book in the Millennium Trilogy is a let down compared to its predecessors. The conspirators who protected Zalachenko and committed Salander into the asylum are revealed early on in the novel, thus removing any sense of mystery. The pair of elderly, terminally ill men who lead them are so out-gunned, out-maneuvered and out-hacked by the good guys from the beginning that there is hardly any suspense left. Salander herself spent the majority of her time on a hospital bed, convalescing from the shot in the head that she received from Zalachenko. The previous books were able to succeed largely because of the peculiar originality of her character and the outrageous stunts that she pulled. With those elements missing, what is left is a rather predictable police procedural filled with tedious bureaucratic wrangling and dull talking heads. The pace picks up a bit with the trial and the novel ends with a sorely needed action piece that provides a closure to Salander’s dark past, but it is nowhere near the level of the exciting episodes that preceded it. Still, if you have read them, you will want to read this one too, if only to get a satisfying ending for Salander, Blomkvist and other characters that we have came to know from the series.

A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,4.13,"Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes novel is utterly unimpressive. In short, the book starts like this:and mid-way turns into this:And I am not even joking. The novel begins with Holmes and Watson meeting, moving into their Baker Street apartment and then investigating a murder of a man found in an abandoned house. At the half point, however, the story completely changes its course and becomes the most awkward introduction of the murderer's back story and motives involving Mormons, polygamy, violence, money, and Brigham Young. The structure of The Study in Scarlet is utterly bizarre.But let's not linger on the bad. I want to use this review to shamelessly hype the new BBC version of Sherlock Holmes.This is an absolutely delightful modernized take on the old characters and it offers a much better version of Arthur Conan Doyle's dreadful story. So, check it out.","(A-) 82% | Very GoodNotes: Despite its mediocre sojourn to Utah, it's an enjoyable read, and an interesting look at the original version of Holmes.","Meet Sherlock Holmes, detective extraordinaire.  Dr. John Watson returns to England after being injured in war. Transitioning a delicate financial situation he finds a partner to share a flat with, the eccentric Sherlock Holmes; dedicated student of science and criminology, and part time consulting detective with astonishing deductive powers that defy rational belief. It doesn’t take long for Sherlock to impress Watson, and when a telegram is received about a murder in the city, his abilities are put to the test. The couple will aid the local police with their investigation. This is the beginning of their many adventures. A great start to the Sherlock Holmes series and the legendary duo that revolutionized crime detection fiction. Very interesting to know the origins of Watson and Sherlock and how their partnership was formed. The novel is divided in two parts. The first part with Watson narrating his return to London and his encounter with Sherlock and the partnership that ensued. Decently good and engaging, although with a sort of unfulfilling ending. The second part with the story of John Ferrier, Lucy and Jefferson Hope, and a tragic event in Salt Lake Valley that changed the course of their lives. Interesting as well, but not as much as the first, and it feels wildly out of place, like a totally different book. The two parts seemingly unconnected until they merge at the end, revealing everything there is to know, and one finally able to understand the magnitude of the whole story. A very satisfying ending overall. Solid 3.5, rounded up for legendary status. Not a favorite, but a very worthy read. If you like the crime detection and murder mystery genre, Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie are a must at least once in a lifetime.Still remaining, the movie (1933) and the BBC series.It’s public domain, you can find it HERE.-----------------------------------------------

Holy Terrors,Margaret  Owen,4.44,"4.75⭐️ | TikTok | IG |This series is everything. It’s hilarious, laugh out loud funny, it’s crazy at times, off the wall outrageous, raw and real, emotional, silly and just plain perfect. If you’ve not read Little Thieves yet, I need you to stop slacking and go have some fun (aka read it). It is hands down the funniest book I’ve ever read with the most lovable morally grey FMC ever. imhoThen you need to move on to Painted Devils, where our lovable and morally gray FMC accidentally starts a cult… OK, all caught up? Now that you’ve thoroughly immersed yourself in this world and you’re clearly in love with Vanja and Emeric it’s time to move on the final book. Holy Terrors is everything you’ve ever wanted in a series finale. The absolute epic growth that we see in both Vanja and Emeric will have you questioning if this is a YA book. and on that note, this is actually the perfect YA seriesIt starts off silly and fun with a small lesson about learning to care for others more than yourself. and then Vanja does what every young adult should do, she makes a mistake, albeit a big one, and from it she grows - she grows so much she learns it’s important to let go of things no matter how much you love them. and to top it all off we get a series finale that feels grown up enough that if ages were adjusted it could certainly be a book for middle-aged adults, but as it stands its a phenomenal journey of self-discovery and learning how to accept and be loved as you are. …. I’m not crying writing this review I swear…Look - stop reading this review and go read the book - nothing I have to say is as important and amazing as this book is. Audio Narration: 5/5 The narrator really brings this story to life and I thoroughly enjoyed my re-read via audio, this is one I will likely find myself re-listening to often! but… if you do want to read an eloquent and well written review (to which I agree with every point) this one is my fav. Stress Reader's Review - they nailed it and I agree with everything they said.Thank you NetGalley and Macmillian Children's & Macmillian Audio for sending this book (eARC & ALC) for review consideration. All opinions are my own.","In an unexpected turn of events I did not care at all for the final book in a series that was once very dear to me. At some point in book 2 this series got so strangely horny, and now the relationship drama is one of the biggest plot points. It made me so uncomfortable in book 3. Vanya and Emeric are so mean to each other for the majority of the book, and that weird love triangle situation in the beginning was so awkward, I cringed the entire time. And the main plot didn't do anything for me either. People were assassinated left and right, but not once did I care for what was actually going on. And the way the election part went on for FOREVER ... I barely liked anything here. I'm sad :(","a groundbreaking finale for the series. it dares to ask: what if we got a divorce book, but in YA"
All the Stars Align,Gretchen Schreiber,3.40,"This sweet and entertaining young adult romance, with a touch of Taylor Swift’s poetic magic and a gender-reversed Cyrano de Bergerac twist, delves into family dynamics and disability representation while presenting us with engaging characters and a delightful read.Young Piper feels pressured by her happily married aunts to find her ""happily ever after,"" especially after her parents announce their divorce, creating a ripple effect throughout the family. Her aunts are hopeful that Piper can reconcile her parents and, in the meantime, try on wedding rings at their jewelry store. During a party, she meets someone who could be the love of her life, but the encounter amplifies her insecurities about her disability and social awkwardness. To get a second chance at impressing him, she seeks the help of her best friend Leo, the ""love expert,"" despite not speaking for six months. Determined to break the family’s supposed curse and fulfill her aunts' expectations, she convinces Leo to guide her in winning over her crush.However, as they spend more time together, Leo confesses his own feelings, and Piper realizes she might feel the same way. Now, she faces a dilemma: pursue her original crush or follow her heart toward Leo, risking a wrong choice that could cost her true happiness.Personally, I was rooting for Leo and Piper (or ""Liper"") from the start, rather than Forest, the third side of the love triangle. This is a charming, easy-to-read romance that blends the magic of a Swiftie universe with a friends-to-lovers trope. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre or anyone seeking a heartwarming and enchanting story.Many thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press/Wednesday Books for providing a digital review copy of this heartfelt romance in exchange for my honest thoughts.Five stars: a blood-freezing, rage-inducing, heart-pounding, tear-jerking wake-up call to all the injustices, unacceptable acts, and unfair wrongdoings of the system!As soon as I closed the book, I sat there for at least two hours, paralyzed—lost, confused, agitated, speechless, and overwhelmed with a deep, aching sorrow for the characters and all the suffering they endured. The most haunting part? This wasn’t fiction. It was rooted in true stories.When you’re cocooned in your daily routine, surrounded by the comforts of your own choices, it’s easy to forget what happens beyond that bubble. This book forces you to remember—with a harsh, ugly slap across the face. It brings to light the most outrageous and shameful era in American history.The story begins with Elwood, a bright and hard-working young man who loves comic books and is about to start college. But everything changes when he’s falsely accused of stealing a car and sent to Nickel Academy—a segregated juvenile facility rife with racism, torture, abuse, and brutality.Elwood, despite his naivety, believes he can fight against the corruption and injustice in the school. Then he meets Turner, a cynical and pragmatic survivor who becomes his unlikely partner in navigating the academy’s horrors.The book seamlessly blends elements reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird, Fruitvale Station, Do the Right Thing, When They See Us, and The Shawshank Redemption, crafting a powerful narrative on systemic injustice.If you have the courage to confront the raw, brutal realities the characters face, and the stomach to absorb the unflinching details, this book serves as a stark reminder of the darkest sides of human history. It urges you to raise your voice, to no longer turn a blind eye.The ending delivers a gut-wrenching twist that knocks the wind out of you.I want to close this review with the powerful words of Martin Luther King Jr.:“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”","Thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for access to this title. All opinions expressed are my own. In Piper's family, it is said that fate will help you find your one true love. Piper has heard this all of her life and believes it in so fervently that she cannot accept her parents' recent divorce or that the boy she has known all her life might be tired of feeling like Piper doesn't even see him as anything more than a friend.In a novel all about fate and love, Piper must also search to discover that sometimes what we really desire is more important than trying to please others. It was cute and cozy and had a very nice story to it that kept me reading the pages. Also, I was entranced by the novel being inspired by Taylor Swift's  Enchanted . I could certainly see this novel becoming a movie. It had a nice message about it. #AlltheStarsAlign #NetGalley.Expected Publication 01/04/25Goodreads review. 31/03/25","I thought this had an interesting premise, but I found the execution lackluster. At about 25% I realized I knew exactly how the story was going to go. And unfortunately I was correct. There was one obvious choice, and I’ve read enough YA that I saw exactly how we’d get there, which was disappointing. I also found it to be quite repetitive, with the pacing not working for me. The FMC’s inner monologue was basically the same thing throughout the entire book, and I found myself getting bored. I did enjoy the disability rep and thought that was done well. And there were cute moments. Maybe very young teenagers would enjoy this more, but more experienced readers will probably find this disappointing. Thanks to the publisher for the copy."
Love at Second Sight,F.T. Lukens,4.15,"3.5 ☆
“For a while during the whole mess I was scared of being the main character, when I should’ve realized I wasn’t. I was merely part of an ensemble cast, and I couldn’t have done it without them.”
I’ve always wanted to read something by this author and this book was a cute introduction to their work. we follow Cam, who has believed his whole life that he was an ordinary human. until one day, he gets a vision of the future where someone gets murdered. turns out Cam is actually a psychic and this makes him popular with the other supernatural factions who want the assistance of his powers. Cam has to race against the clock to find out the identity of the girl in his vision, all while trying to stop it from happening. i liked the friend group here and was curious to unravel the mystery. Cam’s love interest Miguel, was kind of flat though and it could’ve done without the romance all together. the reveal towards the end was so random and the last 20% felt really rushed. this read on the younger side of YA, but i still had fun. ➥ many thanks to NetGalley, the author and Simon & Schuster Publishing for the arc, all opinions are my own.","1 Sentence Summary: Cal has always flown under the radar as a human in a paranormal town, but when on the first day at a new school he passes out and has a psychic vision of the future in which a teenage girl is gruesomely murdered, his life changes completely and he is determined to find the murderer before the vision comes true.My Thoughts: This is probably my favorite F.T. Lukens book so far (although Spell Bound will always hold a special place in my heart).It felt like less of a focus on the romance than their previous books, which I liked. The romance was still super sweet, but it was more subtle. I loved all of the characters; there was such a fun cast in this book! The worldbuilding was cool, too. This is one of my favorite F.T. Lukens universes, with the mix of human and paranormal and all the politics that go along with that.The real star of the show, though, was the mystery! It was so great with lots of twists and turns and suspense, and was a huge page turner. I read it all in one night because I couldn’t put it down. I said I was just going to read a couple more chapters before bed and then before I knew it, it was 2 am and I had finished the book LOL. Recommend to: fans of YA paranormal mysteries.(Warnings: swearing; blood) ***I received an ARC from a goodreads giveaway; all thoughts and opinions are my own!","i was so excited seeing this book bc i've loved almost all ft lukens books i've read?? but this was honestly super disappointing :((( the premise is always interesting, but the execution just didn't deliver 💔 my biggest issue is how surface-level everything was. i couldn't sense the chemistry between mateo and cam; they hung out alone like, twice, and mateo is always present, but his character never gets developed properly. same with his friends - yuh, they're paranormals, what else? nothing.and it's how randomly everything happens. cam and al were like 'noooo we can't be friends' and they had a whole crying scene, and then 2 days later they're like 'let's be friends again'!! 🙄 then the long-disappeared brother makes an appearance 😱😱 and is barely mentioned again!! and then mateo is suspected to be the murderer and cam runs away, and the same night he's like 'omg i'm SURE you're not the murderer' without any basis. just trust yk ✨ cos he's my friend of 2 weeks!!and then the murder randomly happens (i thought it was gonna be the climax but it's not???) and resolves really quickly. which, as it's the big event in the book (or so i was led to believe), is insane.and then the plot twist isn't really a twist, bc you basically can predict it from the start of the book!!oh, also, as a high-schooler, nobody says BFF or jazz hands...like what??? 🤨well, rant over. this book sucked. i hate that it sucked, but my opinions stand."
If We Were a Movie,Zakiya N. Jamal,3.99,"★★☆☆☆ 2.5/5rounded down✎ (❁ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈) ༉ Note : This review will remain spoiler-free as it has not been published at the current date of my review.⋆ 
Tropes
 :▹Frenemies▹Intelligent FMC(s)▹Childhood friends to dislike to lovers▹Slice of LifeIf We Were a Movie is a fun, cute, coming-of-age young adult sapphic romance. It was such a cute read and I had a really good time with this one, shown in how I devoured this entire read in one sitting. It was my first read by Zakiya N. Jamal, and although my rating is low, I will definitely be checking out books she releases.: ̗̀➛ Main CharactersRochelle is our female lead in this novel. She is dead set on going to Wharton for college and just needs that one little thing to make her application stand out. She is highly intelligent, introverted, rational, and a little hot-headed. I enjoyed her as a character, seeing her rationalize her irrational feelings and come to terms with them was really fun!Amira is our female lead love interest. She is snarky, sassy, dedicated, and doesn't take insults kindly. She turns her grades upside down and becomes a stellar student, much to Rochelle's dismay. She is the assistant manager at Horizon and takes her job very seriously, as she truly loves the theater.: ̗̀➛ My Review RantsThis book was just so cute. The blossoming friendship turned relationship between Rochelle and Amira was so fun to read! They had fun banter and really made the progression of their relationship feel natural. Not to mention the cover - oh my gosh, the cover!!! It is SO perfect and I feel like the representation of Rochelle and Amira's characters were portrayed perfectly. I couldn't have envisioned better.The side characters were my favourite part of this novel. Each one of them had their set personality trope and really aced it. They were a bunch of characters, ranging in diversity, who really made Horizon come to life for me. I could see why Rochelle got so quickly attached to the theater because I did as well. I loved reading about and getting to see the lives of side characters develop and see the mishaps or exciting events happen to them.While I also enjoyed that each character had their quirks, from book smart but emotionally constipated, theater kid, goth kid, overachiever, dumb-jock party guy, rich blond, the-one-guy-who's-always-high, to the drama/soap opera obsessed. There were a lot of tropes, and they were SO fun to read about in such a large group of friends, however I feel like these tropes also made the characters feel very one-dimensional. They never really developed outside of those tropes and stayed true to them til the end - which isn't a bad thing, especially since this was a fun and light read, but for me personally, I would've loved a bit more for them because I was so attached!!I also feel that the plot was a bit draggy at parts, especially when Rochelle is able to deduce the entire situation quite early on, and then you are left knowing how it'll end. A little more mystery or bigger plot twist would've really lifted the tension and excitement in the book!Glory's character was a bit of a drag to have around, and Rochelle's thoughts of them were perceivable by me too. Even during the most difficult bits, the high schoolers had to take over and keep things from Glory because they felt Glory couldn't handle news emotionally well, or Glory was shoving extra work onto them that a manager should be handling, not their minimum wage paid employees.: ̗̀➛ Final ThoughtsOverall, a 2.75/5 rating for If We Were a Movie. Despite my rating, I promise this is not a bad book and I do recommend it! I enjoyed it. It was light, it was fun, Rochelle and Amira were very cute. It didn't quite meet my expectations, but it was by no means a bad book because of it. I struggled to feel attached to characters, but the slice-of-life bits were very fun.Jennie and Lisa were by far my favourites in this book, as well as Kerry!!! Kerry is so fun; I would love to have a friend like her!!Thank you to Netgalley for this ARC! To anyone who has added this book to their TBR or is on the fence, please do consider picking this up on its official publication date, April 22, 2025.",This title and cover??? Oh we’re SEATED.,"YA romcom 3.5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️This was such a sweet, wholesome read! The story covers themes of first love, friendships and community.Rochelle is a driven, determined student planning to get into Wharton College. She has everything going for her expect she’s never had a job. She takes a job at the local theater for the summer.Amira is her arch-nemesis in school and the manager at the theater. Her job and the theater mean a lot to her.I like both of these characters. Rochelle’s fears about going off to college felt very real. Her thoughts and anxiety were true to the experience of knowing how your life is going to shift when going off to college. Amira and her learn they have more to relate over than not as they go from rivals, to friends, to lovers. Their romance was super cute and felt real to falling in love for the first time.I did think there could have been a little more to their rivalry. It seemed to be based in academics and being that the story was set in the summer, it felt a little off. There also could have been more character development from them. Besides that, this was an enjoyable read. Their banter was cute and felt real. The element of the mystery, despite being a little obvious, added a fun element to the story of protecting the theater. The side characters were the best! We got to learn about their lives, the good and bad, it made the whole community of the theater come to life. We saw the progression of Rochelle seeing her job as a resume builder to truly loving the theater.This is a perfect coming-of-age, teenage story. There aren’t any traumatic events and the narratives of the characters are relatable. The coming together of people who have their differences to help their community was a great message."
The Corruption of Hollis Brown,K. Ancrum,4.37,"Think of the grittiness of a small village without any prospect that affects its youth. Darkness looms over Hollis Brown, and he constantly pushes the boundaries. A lonely boy who lets other teens beat him, who doesn’t care, and goes to the train tracks to … well, train hopping and do other things that are not safe. The movie Trainspotting came to mind, even though that story is way different. It’s the atmosphere, I guess.Kayla Ancrum has a specific way of writing, and I love it. I already said it before: her chapters are short, blunt, and bitten off, and her lyrical writing feels almost like writing in verse. You can’t do anything but surrender, and from the first page on, my heart got stuck in my throat. Just like Icarus, this story is about loneliness and finally believing in a future. Walt and Hollis were so good for each other. Two boys living in one body, Hollis is angry at Walt, but soon, they start to cooperate as one. Hollis, the one who doesn’t care; Walt, the one who might care too much—two boys who complete each other.I’m afraid of a lot of things.And I’m not afraid of anything. Maybe we were meant to teach each other shit or something. I can teach you to face your fears, and you can teach me to actually be nice to people.Even though The Corruption of Hollis Brown is an eerie and gritty story, it also warms you on the inside. There’s so much love, and I believe we need books full of love these days. And if you like baking: Kayla included several recipes, especially of bread. Thank you, HarperCollins Children’s Books and NetGalley, for this fantastic ARC!  Follow me on Instagram","Ancrum has this utterly beautiful way of using language, sentence structure and snappy chapters that makes it feel like you are reading poetry when reading her work. Every time I read one of Ancrums books they leave me with the sense that I have just consumed something really special. Hollis Brown is a 17 year old boy, full of self loathing, hopelessness and anger, living in impoverished blue collar community in America, where no one ever leaves or escapes the cycle of poverty. One night, after crossing paths a mysterious stranger, Hollis finds himself possessed by the ghost of the 17 year old Walt, a spirit who has been jumping from host to host for 90 years, leaving a trail of burnt out shells behind him. This story explores all of Ancrums favourite themes; young men in codependent relationships that are always a smidge toxic, both suffering from their own loneliness and isolation and finding safe haven within each other. This was also filled to the brim with her special brand of desperate yearning and romantic tension which is so thick you can chew on it. I was curious how Ancrum would pull off a love story where the two love interests share the same body, but this was just so beautiful. I preordered this by way of audiobook and thought the narration enhanced the story in a really wonderful way. Andrew Gibson did a great job moving between Hollis and Walt voices and I think it added a vibrancy to the story which really enriched the reaching experience. I have loved all of Ancrums previous books but The Corruption of Hollis Brown has easily fallen into place as my favourite of her works.","Okay okay this was SO good. Kayla Ancrum really went 'oh you like codependent gays? hold my beer.' because nothing beats the inherent homoeroticism of sharing a body with cohabitating souls.This was peak yearning. Beautiful and healing. Going feral over Hollis and Walt (and Annie and Yulia). Such a unique setting, obsessed with this book, I cannot wait to buy a physical copy.Thank you to NetGalley & HarperCollins for the ARC!"
Under the Neon Lights,Arriel  Vinson,4.26,"Excellent debut! I really enjoyed this sweet, coming-of-age romance. I'm so glad that I was given the opportunity to read this book. It was definitely more than a romance. It was a story about community and culture and gentrification and how it affected Jaelyn.I liked how the story was centered around the WestSide Roll, a skating rink that was the center of the community where Jaelyn lived. I had no idea that these rinks were even around anymore and it brought back memories of being young and skating as a girl.I thought the writing was beautiful and loved how it was in prose. This is the first book that I've read like it, so it was a new and fun experience for me.I think both young adult and adult readers alike will enjoy this sweet story.Thank you to both GoodReads and G.P. Putnam's Sons Books for Young Readers for this copy to read in exchange for my honest opinion.","I haven't read many novels in verse before, because I feared they would be difficult to review. But Under the Neon Lights was just perfect and beautifully written. I have recently become obsessed with Broadway musicals and reading this gave me that same feeling of observing actors on stage in a musical, everything was so vividly brought to life and it immersed me in similar lyrical rhythms of the roller skating life. This was so creative and original for a YA novel, and got at both the hearts of the teen and Black experiences through the lens of a beloved roller skating rink that is shutting down. Against the backdrop of gentrification, Black communities getting shut out of their spaces, and heavy family moments, Black joy poured from the pages. It never felt heavy or traumatic even though it wasn't cozy; it just felt joyful. Jae learned to skate from her father, from whom she also learned her abandonment issues after her parents got divorced and he wasn't there for her. Skating at the Westside Roll becomes her passion and the only constant in her life as she goes through upheaval in her closest friendship and learns to trust a boy she coaches in skating. She doesn't want a relationship because she's afraid every man will leave like her father did. Then the rink is closing, shattering her one therapeutic outlet. So she organizes a goodbye party in a viral moment to properly show the rink how much it has meant to her and the skate community. I didn't know how important roller rinks were to Black culture; in white communities they are being slowly abandoned aside from roller derby. You could really tell their love for skating and I could feel the clink of wheels on wood as they performed tricks and forged love and friendships at a rink where they could be loud and Black. I loved all the layers of abandonment in this: how gentrification was woven in with the loss of the rink, Jae's daddy issues and her tension with her first romance. I cried when everyone came out to support them at the goodbye party. It was a tender and joyful moment. A beautiful, heartwarming and moving read. I really want to learn to roller skate now! Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the advance review copy. I am leaving this review voluntarily.","3⭐️my opinion: pretty cute but way too many pop culture references (over 50 mentions).

The Shadow Road,"K.D. Kirchmeier, Kurt  Kirchmeier",3.92,"I've never read a post-apocalyptic story as hopeful as this. THE SHADOW ROAD casts a world riddled with peril. There are electric dragons responsible for ending society as we know it; gangs of finger-snatching ruffians; bones and death and strangeness tucked into every pocket of a bruised-up country. But Kirchmeier's writing sings a beautiful, awe-inspiring sense of magic through the darkness, turning moments of fear into moments of wonder. Thomas and Cassie were such excellent, endearing protagonists (shoutout to Bones and Dani, too!) and I loved seeing the narrative unfold through their eyes. Basically, THE SHADOW ROAD has everything: action, intrigue, monsters, survival, even whispers of a sweet romance. There's wide appeal here, and I think Kirchmeier has nailed an oft-neglected tone that fits somewhere between upper-MG and lower-YA. It had more of a fantasy aspect than I was expecting going in, but you know what? I love being wrong sometimes. Thank you to the author and Bloomsbury for the ARC!","3.5 stars. The third act and ending happened quite fast and I was bummed I didn’t get to relish in the ending longer. Other than that, awesome storyline and really cool to be in a mythological type book again.","three and half stars, rounded up, just barely....It's a perfectly fine magical creature devastation story that I didn't mind reading at all, but it never entirely hooked me."

i shot grayson a look. ""sometimes, it feels like hawthornes always just know. like you're all so sure of everything.""grayson's eyes locked on to mine. ""not everything."" 
there was something about the way he looked at me when he said those words that made me realize i might be the one person on the planet with the ability to make grayson hawthorne question himself and the decisions he'd made.

like his decision to step back from me. to be friends.

scene two
“this family breaks things.” grayson’s tone never wavered. “my grandfather knew that, and he brought you here anyway. he put you on the board.”
grayson wanted me safe, and i wasn’t. having inherited the hawthorne fortune, i might never be safe again.
“i’m not the glass ballerina,” i said firmly. “i’m not going to shatter.”“i know you won’t.”~~~screaming because the way this man knows she can take care of herself, but he still wants to do everything he can to make sure she’s safe🥲my MAN. ⤷

“heiress.”i couldn’t move. couldn’t breathe. and then jameson was on the floor with me. he brought his face level with mine and cupped my head in his hands. “fireworks,” he told me. “it’s just fireworks, heiress.”
my brain registered his words, but my body was still lost in memory. jameson had been there in the black wood with me. he’d thrown his body over mine.

*inhales deeply* 1, 2, 3.*exhales*okay here it goes. the romance. yes this is what i want to talk about. i have a problem with how jennifer wrote the love triangle. so she picked jameson and i wanna cry :) the last page of this book literally killed me. i’m gonna be so honest right now…i do not feel avery and jameson’s connection at all🫣i feel that all the tension was between grayson and avery…and the only thing i got was a little kiss in front of the cameras AND THEN THEY DIDN’T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT?!? it’s so clear to me that grayson is in love. grayson and avery have a deep emotional connection. like they can communicate without talking, that kind of connection. like gray can look at avery and immediately know there’s something wrong. the way avery would be thinking about grayson…i’m sorry but when was she ever really thinking about jameson like how she was thinking about grayson?! also it’s the fact that jameson and avery were doing the whole no strings attached🥲where’s the connection? i don’t feel it, i don’t see it, but she still chose him😔i promise you that if grayson wasn’t so scared to lose avery like he lost emily and gray didn’t friend zone her because of it…they’d be endgame.i, myself, don’t even feel a connection to jameson. every time avery was with jamie…i’d get a little bored and wished it was grayson she was with because those two were a mystery and that was exciting to me. but she picked jamie🥲this is kind of the reason why i’m dreading to read the last book because i want more of gray and avery😔also people keep telling me i’m gonna hate gray in the third book…so silly, be quiet<3 petition for jennifer to write a book about gray falling in love and the fmc is me🤗he deserves better and better is me<3","Ma'am this is illegal. I thought you were supposed to make one love interest more lovable than the other NOT HAVE THEM BOTH LOVABLE. okay but that confession at the end🥺🥺My first 5 star in months I'm so happy omgThe Hawthorne Legacy picks up where things were left off in The Inheritance Games with Avery still trying to figure out why the late billionaire Tobias Hawthorne left her his fortune. Whatever the reason, Avery knows the answer has to do with a certain person... and so the investigation begins.

""I couldn't shake the feeling that this life was never meant for me.""

It's just another normal day for Avery Kylie Grambs when the paparazzi are chasing after you trying to get the latest scoop, murder attempts are constantly happening, and your father + the daughter of a billionaire is trying to steal your fortune. And to add on to that, you're dealing with the Hawthorne brothers im jealous. *sigh* What a life to have.I loved Avery in the first book and I loved her even more here like !! the character development !! She goes through some growth by the end of the book and just sfsdfsdfs I loved it. Still really jealous that she has the attention of both Grayson and Jameson😭 Oh and also how she can literally say ""Fine, you can take one of my planes."" Not jealous about the downsides of being a billionaire though.Also I really wonder about that quote above. I feel like by the end of this series Avery will no longer be a billionaire in some way, especially with how many times she kept saying that ""this life isn't meant for me"" ... foreshadowing methinks.

“The trick to being abandoned was to never let yourself long for anyone who left.”

JAMESON I LOVE YOU. In the first book, I was bit iffy with him because of the way he acted but here OMG MY LOVE FOR HIM GREW SO MUCH. He's actually so sweet and caring to Avery, like some scene I was so surprised with Avery sdfsfds he's such a precious cinnamon roll. The moments between him and Avery were everything. *HOT TUB SCENE*THESE MOMENTS ESPECIALLY WERE SO SWEET:""I halfway convinced myself that as long as Avery was just a riddle or a puzzle, as long as I was just playing, I'd be fine. Well, jokes' on me, because somewhere along the way, I stopped playing."" !! he actually does really care about Avery🥺🥺""You don't have to say anything. You don't have to kiss me now. You don't have to love me now, Heiress. But when you're ready... if you're ever ready, if it's going to be me--just flip that disk. Heads, I kiss you."" His voice broke slightly. ""Tails you kiss me. And either way, it means something.""
PLEASE THAT CONFESSION😩😩 my heart cant take it, protect jamie😭

“Grayson Hawthorne was arrogant enough to consider himself bulletproof—and honorable enough to see a promise through to its end.”

You'd think because Grayson didn't have as many scenes as Jameson, I'd love Jameson more obviously, right?? HAHA NO BECAUSE THE VERY FEW SCENES BETWEEN GRAYSON AND AVERY WERE ALSO SO PRECIOUS. Like at this point?? I give up on choosing between the two boys, it's impossible. I just want both of them to be happy by the end of this series😭 LIKE GRAYSON TAUGHT HER HOW TO SKI AND USE A LONGSWORD?? plz I love him so much and the way he's hurting so much over what happened in the past *sobbing* even tho this book ended with avery + jameson, i get the feeling next book's gonna end with avery + grayson, and im fine either way just as long as one of them doesnt end up forever heartbroken or something😭Also I just loved the side characters so much, Xander and Max especially AHH IM SHIPPING THEM. He made her a life-size recreation of the most lovable droids in Star Wards, how is that not so sweet?? Nash and Libby omg I ship too. I was pretty sus about Nash at first but methinks he's alright now, especially after reading the B&N chapters. Also Thea and Rebecca <333 Bex needs all the happiness in the world. Skye can go die🙂OH AND HANNAH AND HARRY?? Their love is so tragic, I actually got really emotional over some of the lines😭😭

""Hate me, if you can, for all the reasons I deserve. But don't hate me for leaving while you sleep. I knew you wouldn't let me go, and I cannot bear to say good-bye.""

They deserved more cri curse certain people.Also shoutout to Oren and Alisa for all the damage control and protecting they had to do for Avery when she screwed up a lot. They definitely deserve a raise in pay. altho they most likely get a lot anways lol

""There are no rules that matter more than winning.”

I know a lot people found THL to be super boring and no plot progression whatsoever but honestly I absolutely adored everything in this book. This is the most invested I've been for a book in literally over 3 months. The mystery was so addicting and the tension !! I'm in love and now cannot stop thinking about this book so THANK YOU JLB <33I'm so hyped for the finale and really sad that soon I'm going to have part from these guys😭 Pleasee don't break any of the Hawthorne boys' hearts, JLB.___Reviews:The Inheritance Games: ★★★★★The Hawthorne Legacy: ★★★★★",UPDATE: ok so after much thought and consideration i did over all end up liking this book however my excitement did get the best of me. i believe it’s worth picking up but the book does fall into the 2nd book out of 3 syndrome.you can tell from the beginning that this whole book is just setting up ground work for book 3 so i’m excited to see how things turn out but not gonna lie all the action happened in the last 40 pages of the book. there was a lot of filler writing i was hoping to get that excitement rush feeling i got reading book 1 but i didn’t really get that in book 2 but it’s not something i’m mad about since i did end up enjoying this the description gave me a vibe that there would be more romance in this book than the first one but the believe book 1 and 2 had equal amount of romance as it’s sub plot kinda confused on who’s team i’m on but at the same time my heart belongs to my mans grayson hawthorne 🙄
The Gilded Cage,Lynette Noni,4.27,"omg. that last page has me S T R E S S E D. i can already feel the pre-mature ageing happening because of it. 😫this definitely doesnt suffer from ‘second book syndrome.’ its such a strong sequel that i feel is even better when it comes to developed characters (tipp still has my heart), plot (even more political scheming with so many new players in the game), and writing (really good pacing).but similar to the first book, whats keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the way the plot unfolds (aka the reveals towards the end). its pretty twisty, but nothing specific really shocked me and each little thing still feels very dang convenient. however, the overall vibe is pretty effective, as i do feel very anxious for the characters at the moment. but only because of that last page. my goodness. the next book better cure the ulcer i now have. lol.thanks clarion books for the ARC!↠ 4.5 stars","4.25 stars! Just like book 1, THE ENDING WENT CRAZY. This series is perfectttt if you love twisty endings (who wouldn't?). I'm glad this book moved a lot faster during the middle than book 1! And it's nice coming into a book where I'm already invested in the characters and plot. And the romance is sooo cute. Jaren & Kiva's interactions are so so adorable. But I think whats stopping this series from being 4.5+ stars for me is that I find Jaren a little bland😅😅I do however LOVE Caldon!! We get a ton of him in this book and he might be my fav character. I also love that we delve way more into the fantasy and politics plot in this book. I think if you like series like The Selection or Powerless then you would enjoy this series (I feel like they have somewhat similar political dynamics).The way this book ended sets up book 3 for a crazy and highstakes plot!!👀👀👀👀 Excited for the next & final book!",Ending went absolutely crazy yet again
One of Us Is Next,Karen M. McManus,3.90,"This was a solid sequel! I really appreciate the work Karen M. McManus does in fleshing out each of her characters. She makes sure we get to know every single one of them & understand them. On top of that, she does a great job of providing a surprising plot. I like the fact that it doesn't just end with the explosive point the story reaches and that we get a bit of cushion at the end to see the aftermath of everything. All in all, I really enjoyed this book.",ETA: I hope you all enjoy going back to Bayview!***We'll get a title and description up here eventually :),"Guys, I've gotten pretty old and grumpy in my reading. There's just a point at which you've read so much you feel like nothing is surprising anymore. I had just put down a very blah book when I picked up this one, and thank goodness I did pick it up because it was a balm on my wounded, grouchy soul. My absolute FAVORITE thing about Karen's books is that I know, going in, that I will be in excellent hands. I will be shocked. I will gasp. I will laugh. I will cringe and yell at the characters. I will not be subjected to endless exposition or meaningless conversation. Why? Because Karen is a consistently wonderful writer and ONE OF US IS NEXT is no different. Even when I thought I knew what was going on, I didn't know what was going on. The family relationships in this book are beautifully done, and the suspense is killer (lolol sorry I couldn't resist). I finished the book in a night because I NEEDED to know what would happen. If you're a fan of Karen's other books, you'll love this. If you've never read her other books, you'll love this. She just knows how to spin a hell of a tale."
You're Dead to Me,Amy Christine Parker,3.56,"Gossip Girl meets Happy Death Day (minus the Groundhog Day loophole, just premonitions of a corpse in prom gowns) with Maxton Hall vibes (poor girl falls for rich boy) describes this fast-paced, intriguing YA mystery. The well-played twists make it a promising read for fans. I finished it in one sitting while my husband kept feeding me pudding, worried I'd starve myself as I voraciously read nonstop.The story revolves around Ruby Toller, a scholarship student and social pariah from South Oleander, Florida, trying to fit in with the wealthy North Oleander elites, the ""Bling Brigade."" Raised by her single mother Nadine, who owns a struggling park called ""Wonderpark,"" Ruby is determined to save the business despite her mother's boyfriend pushing for a sale.Ruby's only solace comes from her loyal friends, Anton, an aspiring fashion designer, and Xavier, who aims to become a doctor. Lacking financial security, Ruby's future seems uncertain, but she has a secret weapon: her TikTok account, ""Reputation Killer,"" where she exposes the dirty secrets of her classmates, especially targeting Magnus Bennett, the son of a man who ruined her mother's life. Her mission takes a dark turn when she sees a vision of herself as a ghost in a prom gown designed by Anton, attacked in a restroom. After retrieving her burner phone, she’s caught by mean girls Daphne and Violet, who reveal her secret identity on TikTok.With seven days until prom night, Ruby's identity as the Reputation Killer is exposed, and her previous victims seek vengeance. Meanwhile, a serial killer dubbed the Mannequin Killer is on the loose, using gunshots to kill, just like the wound Ruby’s ghost has on her forehead. The ghost continues to appear, making Ruby question if it's a hallucination from stress or a real premonition of danger. Despite the threats, Ruby finds support in her friends Anton and Xavier, and even Alexander, her crush and a Bling Brigade member, who help her fight against the school's corruption and privileged schemers.Will Ruby survive, despite the ominous warnings from her ghost? Time is ticking, and she must outwit the villains with all her wits and stamina.Overall, it's a fast-paced mystery with well-developed characters and a compelling plot. I couldn't put it down as the suspense kept my heart racing! Highly recommended!Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Children’s / Delacorte Press for sharing this stunning thriller's digital review copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.","❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️Ruby Toller, a high school Senior, lives in Florida with her single-Mom and her Mom's annoying boyfriend, Hunter. They reside at and run at a small Nature Park, that was passed down to Ruby's Mom from her parents.Ruby loves working at the Park, taking care of the animals. It's her home and she plans to always be there. Unfortunately, demand for these types of attractions isn't what it once was, and they struggle to stay afloat.Thanks to a generous scholarship, Ruby is able to attend the very prestigious Oleander High School, a private school full of richy-rich teens.Just because she attends though, doesn't mean she fits in, or is accepted and Ruby has grown a bit of a chip on her shoulder. One thing she has been successful at though is her thriving anonymous-local gossip blog, ReputationKiller.Ruby digs up dirt on the most elite families and community members and blasts them on her blog. Thus, aptly doing just as the blog title states, killing reputations.When Ruby is outed as the force behind ReputationKiller, the whole town turns against her, except for her best friends, Anton and Xavier, and shockingly, an attractive rich boy named Alexander.More of an outcast now than ever, Ruby feels isolated and like her life is out of control, but at least she has a life. Even that comes into question however, when Ruby starts being haunted by her own ghost. That's right, she's being visited by her dead self, in a horrible state of decay, clad in a tattered prom dress. It's clear from the ghost's appearance, she didn't get that way due to natural causes. With the prom just days away, Ruby and her friends must figure out who is going to murder Ruby, and stop them, before it's too late.You're Dead to Me was a super fun reading experience for me. I haven't read a YA Horror-Thriller with such successful Supernatural aspects in a long time.I found the story to be fast-paced and engaging, with some great Horror imagery. It kept me wanting more and guessing. There were some truly intense moments. I also loved the way the Florida setting was used and the stark contrast between the Haves and Have-Nots within this community. It felt realistic.It is super-dramatic, as you would expect from a Teen Scream, but all that drama was really well-executed in my opinion. It had me reaching for my popcorn, versus rolling my eyes, which is always a good sign.I appreciated the way the author steadily built the intensity throughout. The stakes keep getting higher and higher as the days tick down until the prom.I also liked the relationships between Ruby and her best friends, as well as her budding relationship with cute boy, Alexander. The friends supported each other very well, even through all the crazy things they go through in this book.Ruby's relationship with her Mom was rather complicated and I did like the exploration of that as well. Families are messy, you know?Overall, I thought this was a super solid YA Horror-Thriller. If you love a Teen Scream, full of drama and danger, you should absolutely check this one out.Thank you to the publisher, Delacorte Press, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author in the future!Content Warning: An animal, a bear at the park, Ruby's favorite, is intentionally killed by a bad guy on page. I skimmed so don't know how graphic it got, but it was sad and upsetting even to see it coming.","This was pretty good! Towards the end I was like, that’s it??? And then shit really hit the fan. I’m not sure how much I really cared about the motive but…it is what it is I guess. I do want to know why each chapter title was a song name? Like what was the relevance? Not sure if I missed that. Also the paranormal element was never explained—or at least I don’t think it was—and I’m left a bit confused. Bonus points for someone getting eaten by an alligator though! The narrator was good, although her guy voice could use some work. ⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5I received a free copy from PRH audio. All opinions are honest and my own."
A Deadly Education,Naomi Novik,3.95,"⇓ Edited to Add: On the Controversy ⇓
Since its release, this book has been accused of racism. I respect those who have been hurt and am sorry for their pain, but I want to say that—as a Middle Eastern who has also strived to be as aware of racism as possible—I personally did not find this book racist. Most of the accusations I’ve read have seemed insubstantial to me—if you view words out of context with the aim of finding something offensive, of course you will succeed.The school giving El content showing death and violence, urging her to become a mass murderer, happens for all nations as a result of her dark affinity and not just an Arabic speaking country. The issue of how languages/cultures are viewed cynically by the MC (e.g. characters being called “the Arabic speaker”) is not a sign of the author’s thoughtlessness but the truth of how El—who is deeply antisocial due to the abuse she’s faced from everyone (not just some of the Indian side of her biracial family)—sees life, with people as only assets in her eyes. This does not mean Novik endorses these views; she proves her thoughtfulness by proceeding to thoroughly tackle themes of injustice and privilege.However, there is a harmful comment on dreadlocks for which Novik immediately apologised (source) admitting her mistake in adding the passage very late and after the sensitivity read, and that she’d meant to write only “locs.” It makes sense that El would, again, cynically analyse the practicality of various elaborate hairstyles in this deadly school; the problem was how dreadlocks were singled out, and Novik humbly apologised, promising to fix it and detailing how she would do better in the future.So yes I love this book and author, not least because that was one of the best and most genuine apologies I’ve read. Isn’t raising awareness the ultimate goal? What can we possibly achieve by shutting down people after one mistake?I also urge you to read the words of THIS CHINESE REVIEWER before marching into battle.

⇓ Actual Review ⇓
If 
Hogwarts
 was a prickly, sentient, professorless school infested with demons, and the lead was an angry, dark 
Queen of Sarcasm
 and prophesied harbinger of death, trying to study and survive...or die, you’d have this book.Do I have your attention yet?
You have to ration sympathy and grief in here the way you ration your school supplies.
Naomi Novik’s new series The Scholomance is, obviously, inspired by the folkloric Scholomance, a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania run by the devil.There are apparent differences, of course; in that no one runs this school except for magic, and that this deadly version of the academy is the closest young witches and wizards can come to a protected and safe environment during their vulnerable teen years, as they happen to live in a world where their magic-filled bodies are to the monsters what marshmallow crunch brownie bars dripping with chocolate are to yours truly:That is, y u m m y.
Nobody gets to live or not live because they deserve it, deserving doesn’t count for a thing.
With an awesome unlikeable MC (just my type), LOL-producing writing, mouthwatering world-building, YA highschool-ish vibe, and chilling, gag-inducing creatures roaming the hallways, bathrooms, and all the nooks and crannies of the insubstantial and magical structure of the place (one of which nearly gave me—Queen of Being Unperturbed By Dreams and Thrilled By What Most Consider Nightmares—nightmares) this could’ve easily been an entertaining five star read, if not for the info dumps.I enjoy info dumps. I really do. I even binge-read Wikipedia in my free time. But there is something called “this is not the place dammit I’m excited for something else move aside,” m’dear.
It’s too easy to call people evil instead of their choices, and that lets people justify making evil choices, because they convince themselves that it’s okay because they’re still good people overall, inside their own heads.
I’ll just continue to appreciate the tackling of struggles rising from mixed ethnicity and not fitting anywhere, applaud the diversity that extends to even food, fall in love with the dominant theme of inequality and privilege so thoroughly explored, make puppy eyes the attention to science and technicalities, and be absorbed by the focus on carefully and creatively crafted lessons and study strategies, all while listening to my book playlist on repeat (which you can find at the end of the review) and waiting for the sequel.
⇓ Storyline ⇓
(Most) all memorable heroes have a prophecy. Well, so does El. It just so happens that hers isn’t a prophecy of saving the world blah blah, it’s one of death and destruction. Charming, right?Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, no one else thinks so.Thus our snarky little main character will have to navigate school without allies, the consequence of which would not be a lonely, dejected life, but rather death at graduation when she will have to pass through a hall of monsters to get out of the damned place without anyone watching her back.She intends to avoid that, of course, which means this dark witch needs to focus on smooth talking the politics and sitting arrangements of school life and establishing herself as a powerful addition to any interested group (much like peacocks tidying their feathers and attracting mates, one might say), while at the same time studying and surviving and making sure she doesn’t slaughter thousands to do so. Easy peasy.So I believe you realise how annoying it is for a shining hero by the name of Orion Lake to swoop in, repeatedly, and turn her into a damsel in distress.
Selfish of me, you’ll say, to be contemplating with murderous intent the hero responsible for the continued survival of a quarter of our class. Well, too bad for the losers who couldn’t stay afloat without his help. We’re not meant to all survive, anyway. The school has to be fed somehow.

⇓ Storytelling ⇓

I didn’t want to actually become a maleficer and then go bursting out of this place like some monstrous butterfly hatching from a gigantic chrysalis of doom to lay waste and sow sorrow across the world as per the prophecy.
A Deadly Education is my first book by Naomi Novik but can I just say that I stan her style??Witty, humourous, and sprinkled with exactly the right amount of absurdity in her genius similes and metaphors, Novik has immediately established her herself as a new fave author of mine with her technique. I’m telling you, even the (admittedly too frequent and unflattering) info dumps were done with such a unique touch that I’m simply impressed! The banter. The hilarious moments brewed and executed so aptly. Ahhh.
“I know you’re just waiting for us to put your statue up, but that’s no reason to carry on like a slab of solid rock.”
The best part of the storytelling was, however, the way the author somehow threw thriller and humour in the same pot and unbelievably got a delicious unputdownable stew out of it. I mean, we would encounter a petrifying monster that had me on the verge of screaming and we are about to die and yet Naomi proceeds to kindly point you toward more books for further information. Like, WHAT. My expression was something between 😱 and 😂; upon messing around with the emojis, this is the closest I’ve gotten: 
⇓ Characters ⇓

◈ Galadriel aka El:
Meet the protagonist; a powerful witch with an affinity for dark magic so deadly even minor spells can turn into catastrophes—lonely, angry, bitter, sarcastic, smart, creative, natural with incantations, and shunned by anyone and everyone. And, whadayaknow, I was never ever annoyed by her snappish ungrateful behaviour because she’s just pure tragedy and has every right to be as she is—I even urged her on if I’m being honest, and yes you now may go ahead and call me crazy yay.
“You feel like it’s going to rain.”“What?”But Aadhya was already waving her hands around and elaborating. “You know that feeling when you’re a mile away from anywhere, and you didn’t take your umbrella because it was sunny when you left, and you’re in your good suede boots, and suddenly it gets dark and you can tell it’s about to start pouring buckets, and you’re like Oh great.” She nodded to herself, satisfied with her brilliant analogy. “That’s what it feels like, whenever you show up.”
It’s painful to be judged before you’ve had a chance. And El, my baby, has always had the worst assumed about her because of her power and the wrongness it projects to others—even as an innocent child. And tired and full of hate, she becomes the angry bitter person everyone now rightly avoids. I understood how she wanted to be wanted for herself and didn’t care for being wanted by the many self-serving people around her. I shared her emotions and bitterness at what kept happening to her. But more than anything else, I loved her acknowledgement of her anger issues. So yes, I spent the entire book chanting go dark go dark kill them all, praying she’d end up going down the terrifying sorceress path prophecised for her. And yes, I am still praying.⤷ I see her as Disney’s Megara ⤵

◈ Orion Lake:
Meet the love interest; initially annoying, generally unbelievable and bewildering, messy, clueless, also lonely bulldozer of a hero who is such a hero that, at some points, it stops being annoying (to me, I mean, the evil soul who can’t stand these Gryffinpuffs) and starts being hilarious and even adorable. How I ended up loving this privileged, sheltered boy acting all gloriously good and gracious, going around killing monsters as if they are the real baddies of this unjust world...is anyone’s guess. It might have to do with how much of a sweet and non-toxic boy he is.⤷ To me, he’s a total Hercules ⤵

◈ Everyone Else:
I think I need to stop rambling before you guys come hunt me down and kill me in the most gruesome ways you can imagine for writing and writing and writing and WRITING nonstop like a typing machine gone rouge. I’ll only say the rest were fleshed out as well and even our Mean Girl was More Than Just A Mean Girl.
⇓ Relationships ⇓
The dynamic of Gal (protagonist) and Orion (love interest) is practically Megara and Hercules from Disney’s 1997 animation. In short:



So thank you, Naomi Novik, for giving me a new cute, crazy, quietly-brewing, enemies-to-reluctant-allies-to-not-yet-lovers, promising 
romance
 with such a hilarious bond that jumps right out of the page, grabbing me by the throat with its grasping hands made of iconic banter and scenes. And thank you, for the beautifully written journey of discovering what loyalty, understanding, and acceptance in friendship feel like—especially female ones.See? I can keep it short, too. #yayme
⇓ Worldbuilding ⇓
This world. THIS WORLD. What can I say to encompass the massive amount of awe-inspiring info delivered in these 300+ pages? A world with magic-eating monsters where the privileged live in protected enclaves and the rest of the rabble fend for themselves and, inevitably, die. A moody school in the place between nowhere and everywhere that relies on belief to stay upright, so dangerous you have to check every step lest a nightmare jump out from beneath the table and eat you alive. And pure madness.You’re probably wondering: How in the world would an academy with no adults and teachers actually function? Why would students be crammed into a building, all as perfect bait for the hungry demons? And trust me, dear Naomi has thought of every criticism and argument and counter-argument (like someone y’all know *winky wink*), and discussed them to make impossible “I’m possible.”To be honest, I’ve never been especially fond of the teacher-student dynamic as to me it’s unnecessary in most cases—I understand that many need someone to explain what they read to them but, for me, there’s nothing I can’t learn through reading a book or being observant and practicing; in fact, I prefer not to have some teacher keep irritating me and telling me what to do. That’s why I found the professorless school Naomi Novik has come up with to be extremely relatable and rather refreshing when every “magic school” book centres around it. In Scholomance, you either study independently or with your friends’ help, or you die.Fascinating and insane, that’s the only way to put it.An Scholomance-library-sized thanks to my superhero for sending me an eARC from Edelweiss!

⤷ A Deadly Education (The Scholomance, #1) ★★★★☆⤷ The Last Graduate (The Scholomance, #2) ☆☆☆☆☆","Harry Potter’s massive cultural impact means that we haven’t seen the last of magic schools set in Britain, and we probably won’t for a long while. In some ways, the fantasy genre’s response to Rowling’s work is tiresome. In others, it’s exciting—because a generation of readers and writers have grown up to bring their own perspective to the limits of Rowling’s work and push it beyond the limits of its author. However, if you’re looking for a transgressive magic academy book that interrogates the limited morality, inclusivity, and perspective of Harry Potter, you should put Naomi Novik’s A Deadly Education back on the shelf and keep looking. A Deadly Education tells the story of Galadriel “El” Higgins, a half-British half-Indian sorcerer attending a magic school where the consequences of any mistake might mean sudden death. El is a loner by nature and circumstance, but walking alone in the halls of Scholomance might mean being attacked and devoured by one of the school’s monsters. This puts El on a crash course with Orion Lake, the shining hero of her year who takes it upon himself to save the lives of his fellow students, including a less-than-grateful El. The set up honestly sounds pretty good—a prickly protagonist, a heroic rival-slash-love interest, a deadly setting, and the potential for deep lore in magic and world-building. Unfortunately, not only does Novik fail to deliver on any of the premises’ strengths, she also chooses to weigh her narrative down with reductive, tone-deaf, and downright racist details. El’s particular class of magic relies on language. El speaks English and Marathi, and picks up Sanskrit, Hindi, Latin and Old English in her study of language-based spells. It’s a little uncomfortable that Novik lumps dead and defunct languages like Latin and Old English together with actively spoken ones like Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish, but that isn’t where Novik’s faux paus end. El approaches languages like computer programs to be downloaded onto her hard drive. Despite languages being the basis of her magic, she has no personal connections to the ones she’s speaking. She views other students and their languages the same way, identifying groups of students as “the Mandarin speakers”, “the Arabic speakers,” etc. Novik seems clueless about the relationships between the languages she’s building her world’s magic around, putting Sanskrit tombs in Baghdad and declaring that the Scholomance has a library aisle containing all of India’s languages. (About 800 individual languages are spoken in India, fyi.)This clinical approach to diversity extends from language into character. El doesn’t try to make many friends, and honestly it’s not hard to see her classmates don’t try to befriend her, either. She doesn’t describe her classmates as people—she describes them as assets. And while that could be explained away by the premise that half her classmates won’t make it out of school alive, and El needs allies more than friends to survive, it doesn’t make it any better when El refers to others exclusively by the language knowledge they offer her. A character named Ibrahim has no personality or backstory, but he conveniently pops up when El needs someone who knows Arabic. A character named Kaito is thoughtlessly grouped in with the Mandarin speakers. An Argentine character exclaims in Spanish when she’s excited or relieved. There’s an uncomfortable distinction between the languages that get written out in the text—Spanish, French—and the ones that get narrated away—a character exclaims in Mandarin. Novik goes out of her way to let us know that the population of Scholomance is diverse. There’s a group of South and West African students (only one of whom is named, and none of whom are important). There’s a “civilized” enclave of magicians in Toronto who value family and human life more than other groups. One character might graduate and go to Bangkok, but he’s looking to secure himself a place in Shanghai instead. Naomi Novik really knows the names of cities on at least four continents, and she’s not about to let you forget it!But aside from names, languages, and cities, Novik has given no thought to what diversity means, or who these characters are if they come from diverse backgrounds. El calls on “Mandarin-speaker,” Yi Liu, exclusively by the name Liu. Is Liu meant to be this character’s first name? Or her surname? El doesn’t call anyone else by surname, but Liu is a Chinese surname, one of the most common in the world. El’s father is a Marathi-speaker from Mumbai, but El has no personal connection to Indian culture. Her father’s family prophesied that El would be a destroyer, and other than that rejection El has nothing to say about India or half of her culture. She refers to her Indian relatives in clinical English descriptors (my father’s mother, my great-grandmother, my uncles), even though she is purportedly fluent in Marathi and should know words like Panaji, Aaji and Kaka. El says that her Indian family is from an old Hindu enclave, and yet they have djinn as servants. (Djinn aren’t a typical part of Hindu cosmology, though they are a significant part of Islamic texts.)Making El biracial seems like an afterthought, not something that affects her character in any way. It just creates some truly unfortunate optics, like when El goes on a three-paragraph description of how unnecessary she finds showers and how dirty she is at any given time. El’s father died making sure her pregnant mother (and therefore, El herself) would live, and yet El barely thinks about him. His name is mentioned once in the entire book. El complains that (presumably white) British people “assume she speaks Hindi” or call her the color of weak tea. But her Indian heritage is a veneer placed on top of a character who is otherwise just a default white protagonist.All this adds up to a character (and a world), that reads as nothing so much as colonial. El feasts on the languages of others for her own edification, power, and survival, but she doesn’t see her classmates as people, and she doesn’t see language as a living thing related to real cultures. And I’m given to believe that Naomi Novik holds the same views, what with how she throws around the word “mana” as part of her world-building without considering its roots and real-life meaning to Polynesian and Melanesian peoples.However, nothing makes the cultural tone-deafness of this book more evident than this passage:Dreadlocks are unfortunately not a great idea thanks to lockleeches, which you can probably imagine, but in case you need help, the adult spindly thing comes quietly down at night and pokes an ovipositor into any big clumps of hair, lays an egg inside, and creeps away. A little while later the leech hatches inside its comfy nest, attaches itself to your scalp almost unnoticeably, and starts very gently sucking up your blood and mana while infiltrating further. If you don’t get it out within a week or two, it usually manages to work its way inside the skull, and you’ve got a window of a few days after that before you stop being able to move. On the bright side, something else usually finishes you off quickly at that point.El’s pithy commentary about imminent death aside, I have a hard time reading anything but casual and thoughtless racism from this passage. The nefarious and deliberate myth of dreadlocks being unhygienic (and by extension, Black people being endemically dirty) is pervasive to this day. And Naomi Novik decides to include this passage in a book that has no major Black characters, in which dreadlocks never even come up in any meaningful way, just to remind us that in this magic world of hers, dreadlocks are dirty! Monster insects nest in them! The consequences are death! There was no good reason to include this passage, and all it does is draw on inaccurate and racist myths and perpetuate them into a world where anti-Black racism is never contended with. Although, I suppose, why would it? El never has need of any languages from the West or South Africans.A Deadly Education bills itself as a subversive, even feminist, response to Harry Potter. But just like J. K. Rowling, Naomi Novik is a white author who uses other cultures thoughtlessly to build her own magic world. Other cultures and peoples exist, but only to serve the aims and needs of white (or mostly white-coded) characters. Novik has no empathy, no care and apparently no ability to Google anything about the cultures she wants to draw on. And the result isn’t just insulting—it’s boring. The world-building in this book is as dry and dusty as any history written by 19th century British colonizers. Using some foreign names and making your protagonist biracial does not shield your work from racism. It does open you up to more pitfalls in depicting other peoples and cultures, if you don’t care to look out for them. It would be nice to close by saying that despite its flaws, A Deadly Education is an enjoyable book. But it isn’t. It’s just a badly-researched, emotionless story told by rote.","My favorite part about this book was the relationship between El and Orion. El’s prickly attitude towards Orion, who does nothing but nice things for her, totally amused me from beginning to end and I found their dynamic to be silly and endearing. The writing style very much rambles since it’s directly from El’s voice, and is therefore peppered with sarcasm and brooding petulance. This book would be better enjoyed by people who like reading dark academia YA stories (it definitely steers younger rather than adult), expositional world building, and lots of inner monologue. You have to be invested in the world of these magic schools to want to go through the info dumps, as well as like the main character to enjoy her style of rambling.As for some of the criticisms the book has faced, I agree that singling out dreadlocks was an oversight on Novik’s part, and likely her attempt at adding extra detail to her world building. After reading the book for full context, I definitely think it was not necessary to the plot at all, so I’m glad she’ll be taking them out in future publications because such oversights are not worth stirring up controversy. I don’t quite agree with the criticisms about El’s biracial identity, because there are many diaspora people who don’t feel connected to their culture, and we should be mindful of not invalidating their experiences that are similar to El’s. To me, this book is not trying to tackle racial diversity (I would hope not, since that’s going to automatically be a losing battle for any white author) but instead touches more upon class privilege with the way that enclaves are set up and conversations that El has with Orion.Regardless, I would still rather read this than Harry Potter."
My Return to the Walter Boys,Ali Novak,3.78,Will this book ever come out. It’s been way to long and I want to read it.,"Hello? Eight years later I’m so excited for Netflix to be making a TV series about My Life with the Walter Boys, but I would love a sequel too!",I NEED THIS NOW
The Sun and the Star,"Rick Riordan, Mark Oshiro",4.21,"edited may 8th to add more of my thoughts Thinking of that one post that says “This reads like fanfiction (derogatory)”.I’m def in the minority and I’m glad to see everyone else enjoying this book and it’ll def be amazing for younger queer kids. But personally, as someone who has stuck with the og series for years, I didn’t really like it.It’s not even a matter of me reading a book that’s not intended for my age range. Like, I promise you, I can tell when I’m not the target audience for a book. And I didn’t even (mostly) have a problem with all the interpersonal, emotional conversations, cheesy convos, and moments that happened between Will and Nico. I thought it was actually much needed and made sense considering they’re two 15-year-old boys in their first relationship.With Oshiro as a co-writer, we’re introduced to storytelling elements that the series didn’t have much of previously such as flashbacks and dream sequences. I actually liked the dream sequences and didn’t mind the flashbacks that much. I also liked how it, for the most part, handled their trauma and other emotions. However, this is where my enjoyment ends. I think Oshiro’s and Riordan’s voices could have been blended a little more because I could pick out passages written by one of them, which was incredibly jarring. While this book tonally fits a middle-grade book, it comes at the genre from a different direction than what the PJO series traditionally is. It feels like a contemporary middle grade shoved into a fantasy middle grade which fundamentally doesn’t work because of what storytelling elements they both differently prioritize. In other words, yes the writing style fits a middle-grade book, it just doesn't completely fit the PJO world. The writing style also didn’t work for me because of how dominated it was by lame jokes that barely had any of the classic Pjo humour we’re used to, and because of how it had SO MANY pop culture references. These pop culture references date the book which is annoying since Riordan has told us time and time again how the book doesn’t follow a certain date. This is a minor annoyance but jfc they were not needed.Unlike the previous books, this book never lets the reader come to conclusions on their own. There is constant repetition of plot points that already happened in previous books. While on one hand, this makes sense because it’s a standalone, half of these reiterations was entirely inaccurate to canon. Like Nico in Tartarus wanting to be around Annabeth, Percy and Jason bc he’s so scared. ok? but when this scene actually happened in MOA & HOO Jason and Nico were barely acquainted?? Like why not Hazel, since she’s, you know, his sister????Similarly, this book doesn’t trust the reader to keep up with its themes. It repeatedly hits the reader over the head by mentioning how Nico and Will are respectively the dark and light over and over again for 480 pages until the themes themselves become redundant and the characters are watered down into cheap archetypes of darkness and lightness. Like ffs we get it!!! Nico is a pessimistic, depressive, grumpy, gloomy wittle bittle ball of darkness with a soul as dark and bleak as coffee. And Will is the sun! So bright! So much Shining! Shining carebare boy who has never done wrong and is the goodness that Nico needs!! No!!! You don’t get it, he’s the Sun!!! (Completely excluding the fact that Will is a battlefield medic and on some level has already been exposed and a bit hardened to the horrors of demigod life).Until we reach the end and they realize that they’re both complex humans who can find goodness in both light and dark. The book is so heavy-handed in its morals that it almost feels like you’re being grabbed by the hand and pointed toward the characters while the narrative gleefully exclaims “See!!! Light and Dark are both good!” This is stupid because the narrative fails to recognize that the characters already kind of recognize that their nature is driven by ambiguity. It’s what made a lot of people (including Will) turn their attention to Nico because this ambiguity made him such a relatable and interesting character in the first place to readers.Also yes everyone, the characters were ooc at times. The dialogue and voices in the book were absolutely asinine at times. Annabeth would never talk like that like what?? I also don’t like how the narrative undermined her and Percy’s devotion to their friends. (The craziest thing is that they were in the story for a fraction of the novel but their voices were still completely misconstrued.) (Also, the literal namedrop of Percabeth in this book had me putting down my Kindle and just deeply exhaling.)Another issue is the frequent plot inconsistencies and the pacing. It’s also pretty well known that Rick Riordan has an issue with keeping his plot points consistent. But this was on a different level. It genuinely felt like there were so many cop-outs from canon for fan service. Like why on earth are a sliver of Maria and Bianca’s souls able to interact with Nico when they’ve both moved on and are reincarnated/in Elysium or whatever? Why is Hades able to retrieve someone’s soul from Tartarus though it’s been said previously he can’t? Why is he suddenly twirling his bowler hat like a shy teenager? Plz bring back turning humans into plants because when did he act like this before? Also when I say this reads like fanfiction, I mean that it prioritizes relationships that the fandom would love to headcanon that otherwise barely exist in canon. As a result, other relationships that actually exist in canon suffer. For instance, in the end, we get a heart-to-heart between Nico and Piper. But when were they ever established as close enough to have such a heart-to-heart? When did we ever see them as such great friends? It would’ve made more sense to showcase Reyna at the end and this is another problem because where was Reyna? Hazel??? Nico’s sister, like hello?? Also, I understand that scene was in part supposed to illustrate Nico and Piper’s shared grief for Jason but if this scene’s additional purpose was to normalize conversations surrounding navigating your own queerness, why couldn’t this scene have included Reyna instead? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but she’s been alluded to as asexual (also potentially aromantic) in toa which was confirmed by Rick online. I think this would’ve been a great opportunity to center asexuality for once in fiction which so frequently tends to be dismissed as not a queer identity. I genuinely think this problem is a consequence of Riordan paring every living thing together without taking time to flesh out backstories and relationship arcs. This book had to flesh out Will’s backstory and balance showcasing his relationship with Nico and their interpersonal communication issues. Consequently, Will’s character arc and his personality were built off of these interpersonal issues he had with Nico that resulted in his character coming off as if he existed for the sake of Nico and Nico's character arc.(Also, wtf was that plot point of Nico having monster physically-personified trauma children and basically splitting custody with nyx…like wtf was that because I kind of want that scrubbed from my brain.)",you know that feeling when one of your favourite authors randomly announces that your favourite character from your favourite series is getting their own book?? yeahhhh :’),"TODAY IS THE DAY PEOPLE, IM HERE TO REMIND YOU THAT THIS BOOK IS NOW OUTMAY SECOND PEOPLE THATS WHEN WE GET THIS BOOK 🎉🎉 uncle rick has blessed us with our deepest darkest desire *takes a deep breath**screams*SOLANGELO FOR LIFEEEEEEEEE"
Invisible,Eloy Moreno,4.30,"Eloy moreno es un escritor brillantísimo. Este es sin duda el mejor libro sobre bullying que he leído en mi vida, me ha parecido muy real y me ha evocado muchísimas cosas, ha sido muy fuerte para mí leer algo así. He leído todos los libros que este autor ha publicado anteriormente, y me han gustado mucho, pero con este tenía mis dudas debido a los temas que trata y a lo que significan para mí, pero de nuevo me ha dejado con la boca abierta. Los conceptos que introduce como el del niño que cree tener superpoderes o el de la profesora y su dragón, me han parecido sencillamente increíbles. El final ha sido espectacular, un final en el que se nos muestra claramente que lo que viene después del acoso no es ni bonito ni enriquecedor, y que marca para siempre la vida de las personas que lo sufren, de un modo u otro.Mi opinión respecto al tema es que estas cosas ocurren por la ausencia de educación emocional que padece nuestra sociedad, sobre todo en el caso de los niños, lo cual nos impide ver a los demás como personas que sufren y sienten igual que nosotros, y los vemos simplemente como el objeto de nuestra diversión, es como si todos los demás estuvieran ahí con el único objetivo de que se cumplan nuestros deseos absurdos. Por eso pienso que es un tema extremadamente complicado y muy difícil de frenar cuando llega a ciertos extremos, porque la empatía y la educación emocional no son cosas que se enseñen de un día para otro y que eso tiene que empezar desde la base, en lugar de prepararnos única y exclusivamente para aprobar exámenes. Ahí dejo mi humilde opinión, por si alguien lo lee y quiere comentarme algo al respecto.","Este libro es TAN NECESARIO que deberíamos leerlo todos. Refleja la situación de muchos niños a día de hoy de una manera inocente y pura como un niño pequeño puede verla, aunque no deja de ser horrible y conseguir que se te ponga un nudo en el pecho.Diciembre 2024.Sigo pensando que este libro es tan necesario. En un 2024 donde, por desgracia, la historia del chico invisible sigue siendo noticia. Ayudémonos todos, así la vida sería más bonita sin duda.","Estoy en shock con este libro porque no me esperaba disfrutarlo demasiado pero me ha pillado por sorpresa lo que me he encontrado. Había escuchado que Eloy era moralista pero es que el nivel es tremendo. A favor veo que es un libro de concienciación, para abordar temas sociales complejos con un lenguaje sencillo apto para todos los públicos. El mensaje en general es claro pero la manera es la que lo transmite... En fin.La pluma: repetitiva, simple, con la misma calidad que los cuentos infantiles. Plagado de metáforas sencillas que, aún así, te desglosa. No da hueco a que generes tus propias conclusiones (algo que yo adoro hacer y aquí no me daba lugar) a partir de los actos o los comportamientos.Hay escenas exageradas, y la novela al completo carece de grises, todo es o blanco o negro. También incluye unas argumentaciones a favor de la meritocracia y basa la empatía en el factor egoísta del karma. En fin todo. La trama: flashbacks. Partes de la situación presente y se van hilando escenas del pasado para que entiendas cómo se llega al ahora. Y cuando pasado y presente se encuentras, ¿qué tenemos? Nada. Nada salvo una conclusión general del propio autor sobre un comportamiento social generalizado.Personajes: de los protas ni conoces el nombre, supongo que para jugar a que podrían ser cualquiera. No he empatizado con ninguno.Forma: puntos suspensivos como si los regalasen, reinvención de signos de puntuación, cambio de voz narradora por la cara, paso de una escena a otra por asterisco y palmo y medio de página en blanco. En general, entiendo el objetivo, me parece un mensaje importante para transmitir sobretodo desde edades tempranas, pero la calidad literaria de esta historia brilla por su ausencia."
Gallant,"V.E. Schwab, Manuel Sumberac (Illustrator)",3.71,"me: Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantSpice Girls: So tell me what you want, what you really really wantme: I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantSpice Girls: So tell me what you want, what you really really wantme: I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really really really wanna READ THIS BOOK ah…I have finally read the book.At this point I’ve already spent hours praising Schwab for being an expert storyteller, and every new book is further proof to that. So let’s skip to the juicy bits. I love the story for what some readers dislike: the “slow” aka skilful and gradual build-up of the story and the “unlikeable” main character (idk if you guys have ever read a Schwab book before, but most characters aren’t exactly cinnamon rolls? Olivia is pretty mellow compared to Lila or a dozen others). What I do agree with is that the themes are very familiar and if you’ve read a Schwab book you know the aesthetics well: life & death, white & black & red, blood & bone, to name a few. I think it’s time we explore new ground here, to give readers something fresh. That said, it was a rounded and beautifully told story from beginning to end. Maybe a little too round, I like messy things. The illustrations are stunning. It feels like the words couldn’t breathe without the drawings and vice versa. I loved the horror elements, specifically that spine-tingling feel that turns reading into a rush. And honestly, it’s just a beautiful novel to (be)hold. One of those that you touch and page through without reading it, simply appreciating an immaculately crafted book.","while schwabs writing will always speak to me, i tend to enjoy the content/plot of her adult books more. thats not to say i didnt like this, i just prefer the complexity and depth of her stories when she writes under VES, instead of VS. because this story is rather simple - everything you need to know is in the synopsis. its a spooky story of ghouls and demons, mysterious family histories, and houses that come with an opposite and a gate in between. im actually surprised this is going to be a spring release as its the perfect autumn read. again, VSs writing is really quite lovely, as expected, but it took me some time to get into the story itself. but i think her authors note does a great job at explaining the reasoning behind this story and what it means to her, so that was nice to read. overall, an eerie story with classic VS charm and style. thanks so much to greenwillow books for the ARC!!↠ 3.5 stars","I was ready to rate this 4 stars because the writing is great, but as I kept reading, the story lacked too much to retain my interest. The atmosphere is mysterious and spooky, but doesn’t have enough complexity to stand on its own. This felt like a half-formed idea the author pulled out of their back pocket due to the surface-level characters and extremely self-contained plot. After examining the writing for a while, I got the impression that it wasn’t edited as thoroughly as the author’s other books. It almost feels like the author was able to quickly pump this story out for publishing and get away with it because her writing is already solid and lyrical, but the story itself didn’t get much time to develop and marinate."
Daughter of the Moon Goddess,"Sue Lynn Tan, Kuri Huang (Illustrator)",4.08,"Eastern folklore: inspired by the story of Chang’e moon goddess meets vivid, dreamy, action packed, adventurous, mythological fantasy with intriguing love triangle plot line ! The world building is dreamy! You feel like you walk in a spiritual world, smelling that beautifully described multi colored flowers, walking at the path to see the different houses of kingdoms and jumping on a cloud to fly between moon and different earths, tasting the delicious foods, being mesmerized and also threatening by mythological creatures including glorious and heroic dragons! This is mind blowing story of young girl who wants to discover her supernatural powers, is bold enough to challenge to her enemies in expanse of her own life to protect her loved ones! Xingyin: daughter of imprisoned moon goddess learns the hard truth about her mother’s past: she’s blamed to steal the elixir which made her immortal instead of her hero archer husband! When Celestial empress’ sudden visits their house after sensing an unconventional existence, Xingyin reluctantly flees away to protect her mother to walk her first steps into Celestial Kingdom to sharpen her warrior skills, finding her true identity and powers. She becomes companion of the prince: the son of empress who threatens her mother to ruin her life. An intimate friendship blooms between prince and her till she’s forced to get an important decision to fight beside a powerful soldier for fulfilling her potential. Learning to be a strong soldier may help her to set for mother free from imprisonment. I normally don’t like love triangles but this story needs that kind of conflict to test Xingyin’s emotional boundaries, learning to survive after true heartbreaks to become the person who she is.  Overall: it’s amazing, fairy tale, epic fantasy! There’s a sequel but it seems like most of the mysteries already unfolded in this book including the big and heartbreaking twist at the last third. But I’m still curious to read its conclusion and the choices Xingyin will make for her own future! Giving my five mystical and dreamy stars! I highly and extremely recommend it!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter<","“Some scars are carved into our bones - a part of who we are, shaping what we become.”
You know, I didn't think I'd be saying this, but I was so here for this romantic angst.That's not all I liked, but it is the most surprising part. Daughter of the Moon Goddess pretty much opens almost straight onto a chase scene, with Xingyin fleeing the only home she has ever known to hide her existence from the Celestial Emperor who imprisoned her mother on the moon. So it's quite exciting from the get-go.Through a combination of chance and quick-wittedness, Xingyin moves from being a servant to a student to a soldier. A bond forms between her and her study partner, none other than the emperor's son, but he has a duty to his kingdom and they can never be anything more than friends with lusty glances.I found the mythology fascinating, as I did all the questing. Mostly, I think, because Xingyin's motives to finally free her mother were an emotionally-engaging and worthy cause. The stakes seemed high, especially if Xingyin should be discovered before she'd proved herself to the emperor.There is a love triangle, if that's something that bothers you, but I found it realistic and felt that it made sense within the context of this story. Plus it adds some delicious tension that I, frankly, couldn't get enough of!The only thing I wonder is if the author will be able to sustain the excitement through the second book now certain aspects key to this installment seem resolved. If the second book is all about winning wars, I'm not sure I'll like it the same.","Daughter of the Moon Goddess is my debut novel—inspired by the beloved legend of Chang’e, the Chinese moon goddess, in which a young woman’s quest to free her mother pits her against the most powerful immortal in the realm. It is an enchanting and romantic fantasy of immortals and magic, of loss and love.A few things you will find in the story:🐉 Chinese mythology & legendary creatures🏹 Fierce female warrior fighting for her family⚔️ A gentle prince & a ruthless soldier💔 Friends—Lovers—Enemies...I believe Daughter of the Moon Goddess is a crossover between Adult and older YA. Content warnings include: violence, blood, gore, alcohol consumption, death, separation, attempted assault (brief), kidnapping, bullying.Thank you so much for reading this! I am both excited and a little nervous at the thought of the book going out into the world.

Catching Fire,Suzanne Collins,4.35,"I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don’t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. Catching Fire was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don’t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass Katniss Everdeen, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything’s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn’t start out that way. It’s very Lord of the Flies, and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale, but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It’s a big party, and they’re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she’s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy, and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I’m not the hero. So, that’s about three times this month that I’ve been on the side of terrorists. I don’t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin’ pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there’s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I’m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you’re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!)When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn’t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called “True Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.” The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It’s a seriously creepy theory, but I’m not kidding when I say that she’s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I’ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don’t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as “violence is not the answer” or, on the other side of the argument, “destroy civilization.” I’m not positive what the right answer is, but I’d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives?So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don’t know if you’ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil.","Dystopian Perfection +++  After barely surviving the deadly Hunger games, days in District 12 turn simple and peaceful; the life of a victor carries tranquility, fame and well-being. Yet new difficulties don’t take long to appear; being the new celebrity of Panem brings a lot of attention, and of the most dangerous kind. The challenge in the previous tournament does not go unnoticed, and the beginnings of a rebellion start to arise. Under the ever vigilant eye of the Capitol, not even the victors, the strongest among the strong, can escape its power. Katniss and Peeta will have to try to appease the social unrest, and prove their loyalty to the government; or else their loved ones, their district, and even all of Panem may burn for it.Can you better perfection? Well, all I can say this was for me one of those few examples that plainly proves that you can. This was absolutely engrossing and unputdownable from start to finish; just as good as the first book, but multiplied by 2x, if not more. I couldn’t care less if it felt a bit like a clone, it was just so damn good! Perfectly paced and action packed. Awesomeness brought to a whole new level. The events in District 12, the tour through Panem, the visit to the Capitol, the arena; everything so equally absorbing and compelling. And so many new lovable and hateful characters added to the mix, yet everyone real, different and unique in their way. Mind blowing character development, considering the staggering amount of characters included in this book. A true work of art, and probably one of the best dystopian fiction I’ve ever read, if not the best period. Highly Recommendable. Team Johanna & Finnick btw.*** The movie (2013) is another masterful adaptation; highly enjoyable and rewatch worthy as much as the book. The film again bringing the world and characters alive in the most unforgettable way. Some minor things left out, but nothing too relevant to matter or mention, except maybe a few scenes from the book between Katniss and Peeta which I thought were pretty emotional and meaningful. Lawrence and Hutcherson as wonderful as before, yet also many more remarkable performances by a superb supporting cast; my favorites being Jena Malone and Sam Claflin, as Johanna and Finnick, respectively. Although they were not the only ones that captured my heart. Another incredible almost perfect adaptation which I never get tired of rewatching whenever I happen to catch it on TV. Extremely Recommendable.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2009] [391p] [Dystopia] [YA] [Highly Recommendable] [Absolutely NOT a standalone.]-----------------------------------------------★★★★★ 1. The Hunger Games [4.5]★★★★★ 2. Catching Fire★★★★☆ 3. Mockingjay [3.5]----------------------------------------------- Perfección Distópica +++  Después de apenas sobrevivir los mortales Juegos del Hambre, los días en el Distrito 12 se vuelven simples y apacibles; la vida de una vencedora conlleva tranquilidad, fama y bienestar. Pero nuevas dificultades no tardan en aparecer; ser la nueva celebridad de Panem atrae mucha atención, y de la más peligrosa. En desafío del torneo anterior no pasa desapercibido, y los principios de una rebelión empiezan a surgir. Bajo el siempre ojo vigilante del Capitolio, ni siquiera los vencedores, los más fuertes entre los más fuertes, pueden escapar de su poder. Katniss y Peeta deberán tratar de apaciguar la agitación social, y probar su lealtad al gobierno; de no conseguirlo, la vida de sus seres queridos, de su distrito, y tal vez la de todo Panem ardan por ello. ¿Se puedes mejorar la perfección? Bueno, sólo puedo decir que para mí este fue uno de esos pocos ejemplos de que lisa y llanamente prueban que sí, se puede. Esto fue absolutamente atrapante e imposible de dejar de leer de principio a fin; tan bueno como el primer libro, pero multiplicado por dos, sino más. No me puede importar menos si se sintió un poco como un clon, ¡esto fue terriblemente bueno! Perfecto en su ritmo y cargado de acción. Pura genialidad llevado a un nuevo nivel. Los eventos del Distrito 12, el viaje a través de Panem, la visita al Capitolio, la arena; todo igualmente absorvente y cautivador. Y tantos nuevos entrañables y odiosos personajes añadidos al conjunto, pero todos reales, diferentes y únicos a su manera. Inigualable desarrollo de personajes, considerando la desorbitante cantidad de personajes incluidos en este libro. Una verdadera obra de arte, y probablemente una de las mejores ficciones distópicas que alguna vez leí, sino es que la mejor punto. Altamente Recomendable.Equipo Johanna & Finnick por cierto.*** La película (2013) es otra magistral adaptación; altamente disfrutable y digna de volverse a ver tanto como el libro. El filme nuevamente trayendo el mundo y los personajes a la vida en la forma más inolvidable. Algunas pequeñas cosas quedaron fuera, pero nada demasiado relevante para importar o mencionar, excepto tal vez algunas escenas del libro entre Katniss y Peeta que creo eran muy emotivas y significativas. Lawrence y Hutcherson tan maravillosos como antes, aunque también otras muy destacables actuaciones por un sobresaliente elenco de apoyo; mis favoritos siendo Jena Malone y Sam Claflin, como Johanna y Finnick, respectivamente. Aunque no fueron los únicos que capturaron mi corazón. Otra increíble casi perfecta adaptación que nunca me canso de ver cuando sea que la llego a encontrar en TV. Extremadamente Recomendable.-----------------------------------------------
NOTA PERSONAL
: [2009] [391p] [Distopía] [Joven Adulto] [Altamente Recomendable] [Avsolutamente NO un libro solitario.]-----------------------------------------------","This is most possibly the  WORST  (or best depending what you go on) cliffhanger I have encountered in all my reading days. It leaves you more than just hanging, you are grasping for your life on a thread that is fraying and there is nothing to do but hold on (well metaphorically of course). One word that can sum up this book is  intense . Everything is just felt more. The compassion, threats, action, betrayal, gestures, words all of it. This has to be the reason why it is so addictive. As expected from this series we are in for a ride. Some things are hinted out, but the full affect of what is going on isn't totally revealed till the very end. Though I felt frustrated at times this is a grand slam of a sequel. You know it's hard to hate Katniss for being the object of the whole love triangle. I usually get annoyed to no end and can't help wonder what people see in the person, but Katniss is different. Though you don't think that Katniss is particularly more special than others, but that is part of what you admire about her. Plus she is critical of herself so you don't necessarily get a good feel of what people think about her other than what is said with dialogue. I totally love this because frankly that is what it's like in real life. It's others that can show you who you really are when you aren't able to do it yourself. Peeta and Gale are both incredible guys and what makes them so great is that they both are good  friends , something that is lacking in other books at times. Don't get me wrong there is a lot more to the series than the love triangle. Suzanne Collins gives us a lot to mull over till her much anticipated final climatic book Mockingjay.BTW Excellent Excellent covers!!! Later added: For those of you who didn't know there is a movie coming out for the first book The Hunger Games! Here is the link to the trailer. Now just to wait for the second movie trailer...and the second trailer has arrived! Click here to view it. I got the chills guys."
Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,4.11,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one! She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray). The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that ""this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!"" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions. That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: ""I must be the Mockingjay"", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the ""normal, average teen"" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like ""Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that."" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of ""realism"" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this ""Diary of an Emo Puppet."" This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title ""girl who was on fire"" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say ""Enough is enough."" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old. I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book). Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and ""give up on mankind""? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:""Because,"" said Harry, ""sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!""""You're seventeen, boy!""""I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!"" a few sentences later .. ""I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.""Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature.","Dystopian Imperfection.  District 12 has been erased from the map; and Katniss, the rebel reincarnation of the mockingjay, will have to prove her worth one final time. Not for herself or her forbidden love, nor her friends or family, but for all the inhabitants of Panem, now in open revolt against the tyrannical power of the Capitol. A revolution arises from the ashes of the destroyed District 13, and Katniss is the leading protagonist, and a pawn in another kind of game.This was a fairly good conclusion to one of the greatest dystopian series of all time; decently entertaining and action packed as all the previous ones, yet not the best of the series, at least imo. I did enjoy it enough, but sadly it felt overwhelmingly heavy on the psychological side. Feeling Katniss constantly despair in first person for almost half the book was far more disheartening self-inflicted drama than I cared to endure. Not that she hadn’t enough reason to, but it was just way too much. Many interesting twists and memorable events, like the siege of The Nut, the rescue of the victors,  Peeta <\3  and the assault on the Capitol  Finnick <\3 . A satisfyingly surprising ending and a perfectly heartfelt epilogue  Team Peeta for the win!  Overall good, maybe even very good, but definitely not a favorite. ** The movies (2014-5) were good adaptations. Were two films really necessary? My heart says no, yet the rational part in me reluctantly has to admit so many developments and plot twists would’ve been far too much to pack in just one release, making it extremely convoluted and impossibly fast paced; so I think two releases were more than justified, despite the obvious money grab. Not that I care for any of them anyway; I’ve watched the previous films more times than I can recount, but these two last movies only once or twice, and I can live without ever watching them again. Not that I think they are actually bad at all, perfectly good acting, admirable special effects and overall great artistic value; I just don’t care about it. Barely recommendable, at least for completionism sake. -----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2010] [398p] [Dystopia] [YA] [3.5] [Recommendable] -----------------------------------------------★★★★★ 1. The Hunger Games [4.5]★★★★★ 2. Catching Fire★★★★☆ 3. Mockingjay [3.5]----------------------------------------------- Imperfección Distópica.  El Distrito 12 ha sido borrado del mapa; y Katniss, la rebelde encarnación del sinsajo, deberá probar su valor una última vez. No por sí misma ni por su amor prohibido, ni sus amigos o su familia, sino por todos los habitantes de Panem, ahora en abierta revuelta contra el yugo tiránico del Capitolio. Una revolución surge desde las cenizas del destruido Distrito 13, y Katniss es la líder protagonista, y un peón en otro tipo de juego.Esta fue una bastante buena conclusión a una de las mejores series distópicas de todos los tiempos; decentemente entretenida y cargada de acción como todas las anteriores, pero no la mejor de la serie, al menos en mi opinión. La disfruté suficiente, pero lamentablemente se sintió abrumadoramente pesada por el lado psicológico. Sentir a Katniss constantemente desesperar en primera persona por casi la mitad del libro fue mucho más descorazonador drama auto infligido del que quería soportar. No es que no tuviera suficiente motivo para ello, pero simplemente fue muy demasiado. Muchas interesantes vueltas de trama y momentos memorables, como el asedio de “El Hueso”, el rescate de los vencedores,  Peeta <\3  y el asalto al Capitolio  Finnick <\3 . Un satisfactoriamente sorpresivo final y un perfectamente sentido epílogo  ¡Equipo Peeta para la victoria!  Dento de todo bueno, tal vez incluso muy bueno, pero definitivamente no un favorito. ** Las películas (2014-5) fueron buenas adaptaciones. ¿Eran dos filmes realmente necesarios? Mi corazón me dice que no, pero mi parte racional reticentemente debe admitir que tantos acontecimientos y vueltas de trama hubieran sido demasiado difícil de empacar en tan sólo una sola entrega, haciéndolo extremadamente compleja e imposiblemente rápida en ritmo; así que creo que dos entregas estuvieron más que bien justificadas, a pesar del obvio intento de agarrar más dinero. No que me interesen ambas en realidad; miré los anteriores filmes más veces de las que puedo recontar, pero estas dos últimas películas solo una o dos veces, y puedo vivir sin verlas de nuevo. Aunque no porque crea que son malas en absoluto, perfectamente decente actuación, admirables efectos especiales y dentro de todo con gran valor artístico; la verdad es que simplemente no me interesan. Apenas recomendables, al menos para completar el círculo. -----------------------------------------------
NOTA PERSONAL
: [2010] [398p] [Distopía] [Joven Adulto] [3.5] [Recomendable] -----------------------------------------------","I keep switching the rating of this book from 5 to 4 to 5 again, changing my opinion with each reread. On the one hand, it has so many wise things to say about war, propaganda, grief, trauma and healing. It touches and breaks my heart every time, like very few books do. But, on the other hand, there is a large chunk of this novel (in part 3 mainly), that objectively makes almost no logical sense. I wish Collins took more time to work it to perfection, like she did with the first two.Going back to 5 again. For that epilogue. And cat.P.S. This reread just makes me even more skeptical about what a story about Snow has to offer, in comparison to this one.__________Update 11/28/14.  So, of course I had to read it again after getting only half of the story from the Mockingjay movie. Unsurprisingly, cried and cried again. My feelings basically remain the same about this installment. Structurally, the novel is quite messy. There is such a big game going on and Katniss' motivations and actions don't always make sense to me. But the ending is brilliant, especially the final chapters. I need something to cheer me up ASAP.___________Let's face it, a series is only as good as its last book. Is a kitchen towel drenched in my tears a good indicator of the quality of Mockingjay? I think it is, considering that I am not a crying-over-books type. I think this book is a FANTASTIC ending of a FANTASTIC series.The book is lying next to me now, so deceitful in appearance, with its innocent, bright, cheerful cover. Who knew there would be so much darkness hidden between its pages, so much heartache? Mockingjay is indeed a DARK, DARK book full of deaths, sacrifices, torture, betrayal and despair, a book which takes you to a very disturbing but very real place.I have no doubt the novel will have thousands of readers livid, especially the crowd of readers who mistakenly think The Hunger Games trilogy is mostly dedicated to Team Gale/Team Peeta dilemma with some revolt thrown in as a picturesque backdrop. These books are about love indeed, but they are also about survival, freedom, and peace. I find it amazing that people are disappointed that Katniss doesn't take a Katniss-becomes-a-superwoman-and-takes-over-the-world-while-deciding-on-which-boy-to-pick route. How realistic is it to expect a child damaged by hunger, oppression, and violence she had to witness and take a part in, and thrown into the midst of all kinds of political intrigue, to achieve that? How many soldiers do you know who came out of a war unscathed or empowered by the atrocities they have witnessed? How many children? This is why this book has such a great effect on me. It takes a very difficult but honest route, portraying the infinitely damaging consequences of war (regardless of the righteousness of its cause) and Katniss's journey to stay true to herself and do the best she can. And the love triangle resolution. Truly, it couldn't have ended any other way.Is Mockingjay a perfectly written book? Absolutely not, it's not nearly as perfectly constructed or clear as The Hunger Games, but just like another imperfectly perfect successful series finale - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - it brings its message across in the most honest and powerful way possible.Suzanne Collins is a genius, she is fearless and I have a great respect for the gutsiness of hers that didn't allow her to settle for an ending all wrapped up in pink paper with a perfect little bow. I am sure she knew that the faint of heart would be enraged. But she stuck to her guns and stayed true to her message and to her characters.The question now is how will I recover from PTSD of my own caused by Mockingjay? It will probably take me months and a score of Georgia Nicolson diaries to get over it. But I love this book anyway, in spite (and because) of all the pain it has caused me.Real."
Divergent,Veronica Roth,4.14,"What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.  Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another. Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of. AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me.","Heh. I'm torn now. I eyerolled so much while reading this book that I may have permanently damaged at least some of my cranial nerves. And yet I read it in one sitting, annoyingly and inexplicably entertained. Go figure.There just may have been some facepalming as well.It's yet another young adult dystopia based on a stupid premise. Seriously, it's plainly ridiculous. If I had to compare it to something equally ridiculous it'd have to be the notion of sparkly vampires. I'm not kidding. Just listen to this:
""Decades ago our ancestors realized that it is not political ideology, religious belief, race, or nationalism that is to blame for a warring world. Rather, they determined that it was the fault of human personality - of humankind's inclination toward evil, in whatever form that is. They divided into factions that sought to eradicate those qualities they believed responsible for the world's disarray.""



How ridiculous is it? Well, it's a dystopian Chicago where, in an attempt to battle the evils of this world people came up with a BRILLIANT idea to segregate into five ""factions"", each of one is based on ONE quality that is supposed to be the uber-defining feature of them. Therefore we have the brave, the selfless, the smart, the truthful, and the kind.¹ Except some people can be more than one of those - the Divergent.¹ You know what this idea is missing? A Sorting Hat yelling out, ""GRYFFINDOR!!!"" as the character decides to make a choice and join the reckless brave. I eyerolled at it in a children's book where it made its appearance. I exasperatedly eyeroll at it now.No, really. That is stupid. First of all, how exactly will our society ever get to the point where such thing becomes plausible? (I mean, seriously - at least we can imagine the world of ""The Hunger Games"" happening given current obsession with reality shows.) And second of all, how exactly is everyone in this world NOT 'Divergent'? They have an option to switch factions after being raised in one; so basically it's okay to internalize the principles of more than one of them. How will that not make them 'Divergent'? So there's that, and the sheer impossibility of a person to live only within the rigid frames of one of the factions' principles.For instance, let's look at doctors, 'kay? In this book, they belong to the faction of the kind. Because, clearly, for this profession you don't need the smarts to learn medicine, the selflessness to sacrifice sleep and rest in favor of helping the sick, the bravery to cut into someone's bodily cavity, and the truthfulness to deliver bad news or admit when you don't know something. Clearly it would take a special brain to use more than one of these qualities not only simultaneously but EVER.............................No wonder this world does not work well. Duh. I mean, how well does complete segregation work to create peace instead of creating new lines of division of ""Us vs. Them""??? Clearly complete segregation would do wonders to solve the violence-causing issues in the world. History showed us many examples of that. And I cannot believe that up until this point in that universe nobody questioned the validity of this structure.
""I think we’ve made a mistake,"" he says softly. ""We’ve all started to put down the virtues of the other factions in the process of bolstering our own. I don’t want to do that. I want to be brave, and selfless, and smart, and kind, and honest.""
Well, duh. Did it take centuries to come to this conclusion?-------------But here's the thing - once you put in the gargantuan effort to overlook this stupidity and suspend your disbelief to the point that it helplessly dangles over an abyss, this book is actually fun - despite all the faults, despite the shallow characters, despite the many elements so traditional to teen dystopias that you can't help but wonder whether they have been mass-manufactured.It's probably the sheer amount of action in this book - nonstop action that makes action-heavy plot itself giddy from action overload. Did I mention action? Tris, the occasionally too-dumb-to-live protagonist¹, does not ever seem to stop moving. Running, jumping, falling, fist-fighting, knife-fighting, shooting, running, punching - all that while she, a special Divergent snowflake, learns to fit in among the Dauntless, the Gryffindor-brave (read: stupidly reckless) faction of this universe.¹ Tris on purpose nonfatally shoots two bad guys (one of whom tried to actually rape her and kill her) - but kills one of her friends (who was mind-controlled via the actions of one of the aforementioned villains) on purpose, when a disabling shot would have worked just as well. And she shoots her friend AFTER she thinks she won points with God by not killing the villain. *eyeroll*
""Somewhere inside me is a merciful, forgiving person. Somewhere there is a girl who tries to understand what people are going through, who accepts that people do evil things and that desperation lead s them to darker places than they ever imagined. I swear she exists, and she hurts for the repentant boy I see in front of me. But if I saw her, I wouldn’t recognize her. “Stay away from me,” I say quietly. My body feels rigid and cold, and I am not angry, I am not hurt, I am nothing. I say, my voice low, “Never come near me again.” Our eyes meet. His are dark and glassy. I am nothing. “If you do, I swear to God I will kill you,” I say. “You coward.”
Yeah, don't piss off Tris. You may not be prepared for what's coming.Yes, almost the entire book is the scenes of Tris training to become super-awesome, occasionally punctuated by the scenes of mandatory self-doubt. She kicks ass (literally) and she is loving it. Of course, in the way mandatory to all YA dystopias, her training just proves that this plain little average humble girl is the sexy badass that is better than anyone else at whatever she chooses to do, and somehow will be number one no matter what she does because she is, well, special.Because, it seems, ever since Rocky Balboa took the second place we have become accustomed to root for the seeming underdog - but that underdog now invariably turns out to be the winner of whatever competition there may be in the book - and the hottest male lead as a special prize.Those rare times the underdog loses. This is not the case in this book. Duh.And yet, annoying as these scenes are, they are still so much fun to read. Silly, shallow, mindless fun - the kind you get when you playing a fast-paced videogame, perhaps - but fun nevertheless. Yes, most of the action here is juvenile and seems pointless as a part of faction training - but hey, so is shooting up the heads of videogame aliens. But it's still entertaining.So here's what I'm trying to say here: Suspend your disbelief, don't think too hard about what's happening, approach it as just fun - and you will be rewarded with a fun ride, like that giant rollercoaster in the amusement park that is worth it while you're on it (and slightly less worth it when you're puking up your lunch into a trashcan afterwards). Would I have given this book the GR Choice Awards? No, and I would not give one to 50 Shades of Grey either. And of course, my opinion is NEVER wrong, right?But for the entertainment value alone I will give it 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. Still, I'm undecided whether I care enough about what happens to Tris to invest time into reading the sequel. ------------So I did read the sequel after all - and here is my review of it. And here is  the review for the final installment in the series, 'Allegiant'. Spoiler: these books get worse and worse.","As seen on The ReadventurerWe all know why Divergent was written. There is no doubt 99% of dystopias published during the last year or so have been trying to at least partially replicate the success of the trilogy. Public wants to read more dystopian stories, publishers want to sell them, authors want to write them. Everyone is happy. I have read a few new dystopias recently and liked or disliked them to various degrees. There are dystopias for any taste, dystopias that emphasize separate aspects of the trilogy. There are dystopias that bank on romance (Matched or Delirium). There are dystopias that take the shock value route (Wither). And then there is Divergent that caters to the crowd who wants more action in their dystopias. And action this novel delivers!In a few words, Divergent is a one long initiation trial. Beatrice Prior is a member of a society that has been maintaining its peaceful existence by separating its citizens into 5 distinct factions. These factions are formed on the basis of virtues they cultivate in their members - Candor values honesty the most, Abnegation - selflessness, Dauntless - bravery, Amity - peacefulness and Erudite - intelligence. At 16 all citizens take a test that is supposed to help them decide if they want to stay with the faction into which they were born or transfer to another faction forever. Beatrice's test results are inconclusive and puzzling. Ultimately she decides to abandon her own faction (Abnegation) and her family and enter another (Dauntless). But of course, the transfer is not easy. The initiation trials are grueling. Divergent is essentially a depiction of Beatrice's road to becoming a Dauntless, both physically and emotionally. Beatrice's unusual test results come to play too, and in a major way.This emphasis on multiple trials and exercises is the strongest and the weakest part of the story. Veronica Roth has a special talent for writing great fighting scenes, pulse-raising and adrenaline-pumping scenes. Her imagination in terms of inventing different tests and challenges seems to be limitless. Something exciting happens to Beatrice every day of her trials. But that is also the weakness of the story. About 85% of the book is dedicated to action and exercises. The actual story starts only around page 415 of this 500-page book. Only then stakes are raised and real action begins. If you ask me, 400-pages is a lot of prep to finally get to the meat of the story.Don't get me wrong, I liked the book (3 stars means ""i liked it"" on Goodreads). Divergent is good entertainment. I liked it, I was engaged in the story, I was even excited quite often. But something was missing for me. The novel has good characters, but they are not quite as interesting and compelling as they could have been; it has a lot of action, but the justification for the amount of violence involved is not quite adequate; it has a cute romance, but it never quite makes your heart contract in that sweet, painful way (you know what I am talking about, don't you?); the concept of factions is a unique one but not quite plausible; the explanation what a Divergent actually is is not quite climactic; finally, except for one plot twist (p 415), the story takes a rather predictable road.I liked Divergent. I liked it more than Matched, Delirium or Wither. I liked it less than Blood Red Road or Ship Breaker. It entertained me. It promotes all the good things - bravery and self-sufficiency, friendships, honesty, determination. It is all about girl empowerment. But as the same time it isn't particularly thought-provoking or chilling. It never truly touched my heart. It is a write-by-numbers dystopia.The verdict? I guess, you'll have to see for yourself?P.S. While I am on the subject of dystopias and have your attention, I want to recommend one of my most favorite dystopias that doesn't get nearly as much acknowledgment as it deserves.

Sassy.*character limitClick here for the rest","Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.","“I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.” — Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead’s questions — and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil’s Snare, Harry’s best mate Ron bellows “HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him “Are you a wizard, or what?” thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry’s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret “shout-out” to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that “neither shall live while the other survives”, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort’s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn’t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn’t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling’s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied."
New Moon,"Stephenie Meyer, Sylke Hachmeister (Translator)",3.61,"Stephen King once said, ""Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good."" I couldn't agree more, Stephen. With that, we shall kick this off with a joke:

Heh. This re-reading is brought to you courtesy of Project: Hindsight. 

I'm sorry folks. I just could not get through this shit book another time. However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously, how is it possible a book with almost no plot can be so long? When I first read New Moon back in 2008, I didn't like it. In fact I'm not even sure why it had three stars because I remember being super frustrated. Even though Edward and Bella's relationship deeply disturbs my soul, Bella is so incredibly boring without him. I'm not even sure how Stephenie Meyer managed 563 pages. Truly, I'm amazed because I can sum up New Moon in one big picture:

But let's get on with it, I'll go into some detail for ya.The book starts off on Bella's 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward. So, she makes a huge production about people not celebrating her birthday, but the Cullens ignore her and Alice plans a party. Before Edward forces her to attend they watch Romeo and Juliet (the book's supposed theme) and they have merry little conversation about Edward's contingency plans once Bella dies. Now, let's not forget they've only been dating for a few months. Yet, here they are making out and talking about killing themselves in the event of the other's death. How romantic. Don't even ask me the logic behind how they can even kiss when his teeth are supposed to be ""venom coated."" Stephenie Meyer gives some bull shit excuse she must have learned from ass-grab 101. But I digress...Finally, they make it to the birthday party. Bella gets a paper cut and Jasper almost single-handedly ends this series on page 29.

 Unfortunately, to my dismay his attempt was foiled by Edward. Eddie pushes Bella out the way and she crashes into the glass plates, slashing up her arm. Pause, let's think about that scene a bit: Who's bright idea was it to have glass plates? With a human. In a room full of vampires. That drink blood. Isn't Alice psychic? Why didn't she see Bella cutting her finger on the wrapping paper? Wait, don't think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we'll never get through this review.Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for...wait for it...being human. Bella, you know you've been hanging out with mythical creatures too much when you start thinking your humanity isn't normal. But anyway, Eddie does what any loving boyfriend would do after their girlfriend is attack by their brother: he ignores her. And because Eddie is ""Alpha Male Edward"" and Bella is ""Submissive Mary Sue Bella,"" she doesn't confront him about it. Instead, she waits for him to be ready. On the third day of ignoring her, he drags he into the words and chucks up the deuces. The exchange goes a little like this:

Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, ""No, I don't want you to come. You're no good for me."" And she pretty much agrees realizing how much of a waste of space she is. Then Edward just pours salt all over her open wound and tells her: 
""Don't do anything reckless or stupid,"" he ordered, no longer detached. ""Do you understand what I'm saying?...I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself--for him.""I nodded helplessly.
 Wow. Relly? You're just going to let him order you around like that? How about you look after yourself FOR YOU first, everyone else second? Awesome Bells. Can I call you Bells? Not only do you have ZERO self-preservation skills, but also no self-confidence. Just awesome. There's only about a million or so girls looking up to you as a role model. No pressure to be a strong female character. You could have walked away from this with grace, but no, instead all your dignity flies out the window when you pull a bitch move and run after Edward through the woods.

Then, she defaults back to ""Fuck my life"" mode and slips into a depression for four fucking months. I find it kind of funny her depression was longer than their actual relationship. Heh. But this wasn't just any depression, it was some serious shit. 
I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it.
 Or how about this: 
Even my outsides looked different--my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that--if I were beautiful and seen from a distance--I might even pass for a vampire now.
 Once again I find myself asking the question: Where are her parents?! Why did Charlie let this go on for FOUR months?! She should have been in counseling or something. But Meyer thinks she can just pacify readers by Renee sending a random e-mail here and there or Charlie just suggesting she seek help, only to be shot down by Bella. Fail. So much fail. All that considered, that's not even the biggest problem I have with this book. Bella soon figures out she can conjure up hallucinations of Edward if she does something reckless or suicidal. This is where Jake comes into play. Bella uses Jake (like everyone else) to get what she wants by asking him to fix up two motorcycles she found and giving her riding lessons. She figures it will be the perfect thing to help her see more of Edward. I suppose she simply forgot how big of a klutz she is and once the bikes are fixed the lessons commence. The first time she gets on she falls off and Jake (the only one with common sense) thinks they should call it a day before she gets hurt. But Bella thinks this is BK and she can have it her way, and gets back on the bike. 





Chick has gone batshit crazy and she promptly busts her ass. But she doesn't care because her mission was a success! She got to see and hear Edward! Her next brilliant idea is to throw herself off a cliff during high tide. The first time I read this I was secretly hoping she would drown, but the other two books already were published, so it was a hopeless wish. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the actual plot. LOL. Funny how that happens when there isn't one, huh? LOL. The She-vamp, Victoria, is scoping out the area trying to get to Bella. But her part is VERY small in this book (like the plot), so we don't really need to talk about her. I suppose the wolf pack is worth mentioning: They're pretty much a bunch of wannabe werewolves that run around with their shirts off. 



That's all you really need to know about them. So, finally Alice shows up in chapter 18 because she thought Bella was trying to commit suicide (close enough Alice). And through a nice little exchange of ""he said, she said"" BS, Edward is off to Italy to kill himself. This causes Bella to go into ""hero"" mode and race to Italy and save Edward. I really don't care enough to give my thoughts on the race to Italy. That entire part was rushed and anti-climatic. There isn't even a fight scene. Instead here is a timeline courtesy of Reasoning with Vampires (Thanks for the link Cait and Jen!):

Anyway, they get back to good old Forks and Bella composes a vote on everyone's thoughts of her joining team undead. Edward is at a steady ""no"" along with Rosalie. But everyone else says, ""Hell yes!"" Like becoming a vampire is a party or something. Funny thing is when Bella asks Jasper he goes:

And she's all:

Hmm, yeah, that's not weird at all. Not the least bit creepy.In the last few pages Edward and Jake have a little pissing contest and Edward proposes to Bella. The End. Yawn. Thank God it's over. Now where's my fuckin' chocolate?My Twilight Review can be found here.***BONUS***Oh, yeah, bonus time. 'Cause what's a review without one?Quick! If I were to light Edward on fire what would he become?

Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. Really cringing at my younger self..And yet....I still loved itSo, I guess I'm cringing at my older self too.
Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire
 When Bella gets a paper cut during her birthday, she (in typical ridiculously unstable fashion) slices her arm open and stuffs it with glass. She becomes surrounded by seven thirsty vampires.While she manages to make it out alive, Edward is horrified by what his family has the potential to do. (How is this a surprise?) (They're bloody vampires.) Edward does the sensible thing and completely erases himself from her life. Bella does the sensible thing and completely erases her mind. She throws herself into this weird fugue state for the first few chapters.
I honestly have no idea how to live without you.
 Codependency for the win. Seriously, their relationship is so messed up when I think about it. 100 year old man, 18 year old girl.  I mean 
 technically 
 it isn't statuary but give Edward a few wrinkles and a stooped walk...and this book would be giving off a whole different vibe.Looking back now, I don't understand how I was Team Edward for this book. Poor Jacob did all that work with healing Bella only to get thrown aside as soon as a little sparkle dances her way. I remember my sixteen year old self absolutely crying when Bella goes into the fugue state after Edward leaves and bawling again when he came back. I kept thinking, ""This is TRUE love.""

Kind of a baller move. Especially since it worked.Anyway. I have a soft spot for these books a mile wide due to a little something called “I was thirteen when Edward Cullen changed my life forever,” and even I had a hard time getting through this one. This series is not well-written and the characters are not likable and the romance is insta-lovey AT BEST. All they have going for them is being fun.Hopefully Stephenie Meyer got the memo in time for my reread of Eclipse.Bottom line: The best part of this whole book is when like 5 whole months are just blank pages.----------------pre-reviewturns out the only thing i needed to become team jacob was 9 years and the harsh hit of reality.review to come / 2 stars----------------currently-reading updateseven when i was 13 i knew this book was...not good.what better time to reread it than in the midst of a reading slump?"
No More Tears: The Dark Secrets of Johnson & Johnson,Gardiner Harris,4.29,"making the executive decision to dnf this because i am boredddd out of my mind! so much potential, but there’s just a lot of history and detail and i want juicy gossip. and YES i did count this towards my reading goal because i wasted too much time on it for it to not count for something!!","Johnson & Johnson has built a health care empire that includes prescription and OTC drugs, orthopedic implants, and surgical products, as well as household products.The company has had its share of scandals, government investigations, recalls, and lawsuits over the years. Internal documents show J&J and its subsidiaries knew about problems with their products but sold them anyway.None of this is new. Being in the health care field I’ve been hyper-aware of these issues. They’ve been reported in the news for decades. The conundrum is it would be nearly impossible for a consumer to avoid their products. A quick google search leads to hundreds of J&J products, too many to list here. Documents show J&J and its subsidiaries knew about problems with some of their products but hid that information and sold them anyway. The most widely reported lawsuits involved:* their baby/talcum powder, which contained asbestos, causing cancer. (please note it is now made with cornstarch)* Risperdal, an anti-psychotic drug, which the company marketed to children and off-label uses despite knowing it caused gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) in males* the surgical pelvic mesh which caused horrific side effects, including chronic pain, and erosion through the pelvic wall, ruining countless women’s lives. Their corporate rap sheet makes the Sackler family look like Pollyanna. Yes despite all this, they remain in business, and doing better than ever. Their aggressive marketing techniques are so successful J&J remains a trusted name despite their track record. They’ve diversified their products into multiple divisions to lesson the impact of lawsuits and massive settlements. To be fair, they are not all bad. The majority of their products are safe & effective. After the Tylenol poisonings from an individual who laced the capsules with cyanide in 1982, the company had a massive recall, and led the way in developing tamper proof packaging. Other companies followed suit with the packaging we see today. The result was the halo effect on J&J. Do not expect the government or the FDA to protect the public. This book highlights the issue with an in-depth look at the pharmaceutical giant’s long history and how they’ve endured despite scandal after scandal. Their legal team are experts at using the law to their advantage. (As an aside: J&J voluntarily recalled neutrogena sunscreen after testing revealed the presence of benzene, a cancer causing chemical. The FDA knew this for months yet failed to take action)So yes, not all bad, but when they are bad, they are very very bad. But the real takeaway is that we, the public, are at the mercy of ALL pharmaceutical companies, trusting that they have our best interests at heart, and trusting the government and the FDA to keep us safe.That blind trust is misplaced, evidenced by the exposés and ongoing legal battles in recent years. Changes must be made and I hope in the coming years this will be a priority in our government. No corporation should get away with deliberately withholding vital information from the public. As consumers we must be informed - ask questions and do your own research into medications and products. Are there lawsuits or recalls involved in the drug or product? Support watchdog groups and consumer advocacy groups. And if you’ve been harmed get legal counsel and join class action lawsuits.This was a book that Marialyce and I read, one that left us disheartened and disgusted.","Reading no more tears, gave me tears! There is a lot of information about the Johnson and Johnson company, which are all facts. It took five years for this journalist to put everything together, all backed by evidence. The book is well researched and it has all the credible sources in it. This book left a disturbing impact on me. It was very well written and thought provoking. Throughout the book, I had experienced several emotions while reading this. I felt angry, upset, mad, confused and frustrated.

"Into the Ice: The Northwest Passage, the Polar Sun, and a 175-Year-Old Mystery",Mark Synnott,3.94,"When I read INTO THE ICE, I was thinking about two other books, both very disparate. The first (you will forgive me if I don't recall the title) was by my fellow Baylor Bear, Chip Gaines, and it was a kinda-sorta autobiography, the story of his career as someone who restores old houses on TV, and I came away from that thinking that Chip Gaines was the most obnoxious, self-absorbed, insufferable person I had ever ran across in print. Generally speaking, if you are first-person narrating your own story, and you come across like Chip Gaines, even a little bit, you are in a lot of trouble. Mark Synnott is a much better writer than Chip Gaines and generally a more accomplished person. Synnott is a mountain climber (he climbed Mount Everest, and is the sort of person who feels the need to remind you about this every so often) and developed a love of sailing in the South Pacific. He then bought a boat, promptly got divorced, bought another boat and got another wife, and conceived the idea of sailing this boat from Maine, all the way up to Greenland, through the ice-bound Arctic Sea, ending up at Nome, Alaska. This is a fiberglass sailing boat, the kind you see in marinas everywhere, not exactly an icebreaker, you understand. Why do this? The answer seems to be that very few people have climbed Mount Everest (including Mark Synnott! Ask him, he'll tell you about it!) but fewer have sailed the Northwest Passage, and Synnott wanted to be one of those people, too. But in order to make this a going concern, Synnott needed a sponsor, and that sponsor ended up being National Geographic, and they wanted to do a documentary that was basically (you will never believe this) NOT about Mark Synnott, necessarily, but was about something else entirely, and that something else was the Franklin expedition.This brings me to the other book, THE MINISTRY OF TIME, by Kaliane Bradley, which is sort-of-kind-of about the Franklin expedition, or rather about a near-future junior bureaucrat in London who finds herself babysitting a refugee from the Franklin expedition plucked out of time. One of the pleasant things about THE MINISTRY OF TIME (other than it not having anything to do with Chip Gaines) is that... er... you don't actually have to know anything about the Franklin expedition other than the key facts that it was populated by a bunch of stoic stiff-upper-lip English types and that everybody died, because of course they did. You can move on to the story.That strategy doesn't work here. Mark Synnott has read an appalling amount about the Franklin expedition, and shares a good bit of it. National Geographic, in its wisdom, decided that the long-lost Franklin expedition is much, much more interesting than Mark Synnott (I know, I'm as shocked as you are) and so that's what the documentary is going to be about, so the story of Mark Synnott sailing a ship there takes second place to that, and it becomes a big part of the book as well. Several points to be made.1. I like Mark Synnott much better when he is talking about the Franklin expedition than when he is talking about himself. There's a passage where Synnott gets crossways with one of his crew, and he pauses to reflect that, you know, people have told me I can be a little overbearing at times. Reader, I was reading this book on my phone, and I did not throw my phone across the room, because it is expensive. Had I been reading a physical book, there's a good chance it would have somehow become embedded in the drywall. ""A little overbearing?"" YOU DON'T SAY.2. There is the question of ""how much do you need to know about the Franklin expedition before you read this book?"" I don't think the answer to that is ""a whole lot,"" but more than the basics would be helpful. There are two reasons for that. First, the reason why the whole Franklin thing is interesting is because it is a mystery, we don't know exactly what happened when and what caused the death of all those people. Second, because Synnott tells the story non-chronologically, skipping around, depending on where he is geographically at the time.3. You don't need to know anything about sailing, though, Synnott is just a good enough writer that you can tell what is going on without you having to know how to splice the bowline or anything like that. Do I recommend this book? I mean, it more-or-less comes down to how much Arctic adventure you're willing to stand. I am generally okay with that, it's why I picked the book up in the first place. If you're fine with the rest of it, go for it. (But don't read the Chip Gaines book, I am begging you.)","A real page turner. I love reading about extreme adventures in cold regions, and Mark Synnott is a great storyteller. He skillfully combines the narrative of an attempt to sail the Northwest Passage in his own boat with a lot of historical background - not only stories about the lost expedition of Sir John Franklin, but also about the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.My main objections are actually raised by the author himself. At one point he begins to question his motives: “This voyage was a dream come true for me, but it was also expensive, had no intrinsic purpose, and certainly wasn’t serving the locals in any way”. And a little earlier he admits:“I’d come to realize that there was something alien about moving through these waters aboard a modern sailing yacht with a fixed timetable, requisite fuel stops, and a need to always keep pushing as fast and hard as possible. Ensconced within Polar Sun’s canvas enclosure or in my bunk deep inside the ship, I often felt removed from the landscapes, the wildlife, and the people who lived in the communities through which we passed. It was obvious that the best way to travel through this realm was by foot and paddle, as Inuit have for millennia with their dog sleds and kayaks, traveling nimbly from one community and hunting ground to the next. And it saddened me that I might be missing the essence of the place that I so badly wanted to experience.” While I don't want to undermine what the author and his crew achieved, the reader's thrill is a bit diminished by the knowledge that they could abort their voyage and evacuate at any time. I have to admit that I prefer to read about more daring adventures, like Adam Shoalts' explorations of the Canadian Arctic - yes, by foot and paddle, alone and self-sufficient for weeks at a time. Still, Synnott's voyage ""makes a hell of a story,"" to quote the author, so if you like that kind of armchair travel, you should definitely read this book.Thanks to the publisher, PENGUIN GROUP Dutton, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.","What a great read for anyone a fan of history, culture, arctic and adventure, like me. Mark was able to blend the details of his Northwest Passage voyage with the tale of the lost ships and sailors of HMS Erebus and Terror with ease. I enjoyed learning about Inuit culture and life in the arctic. Also, there is the unfortunate truth that climate change is threatening these fragile places and reading Into The Ice makes me want to advocate even more for the protection of these areas. I loved the cliffhangers and I wasn’t sure at times if they would actually make it through the passage that season. I can’t imagine sailing through arctic water surrounded by giant icebergs and polar bears, threatened by multiple storms and it definitely made for an epic adventure.I can also relate to the riff between Mark and Ben, it’s hard to live with people closely for so long without tension building up. I was happy they were able to stay friends.I would recommend this book for any fans of outdoor adventure novels. I can’t wait to check out Mark’s other books The Third Pole and The Impossible climb. Thank you to Goodreads for this giveaway win, I was so excited for this one it is totally my niche!"
Ocean: Earth’s Last Wilderness,"David Attenborough, Colin Butfield",4.54,"""We have changed the ocean so profoundly that the next hundred years could either witness a mass extinction of ocean life or a spectacular recovery. I will not see how that story ends, but, after a lifetime of exploring our planet, I remain convinced that the more people enjoy and understand the natural world, the greater our hope of saving both it and ourselves becomes.""a gentle, poetic and insightful, yet also devastating, necessary and urgent love letter to the oceans from a man who's spent his whole lifetime discovering & protecting them","4.5 StarsAs a huge nature lover that has watched and read countless series and books by the legend that is David Attenborough, I was desperately excited to read this newest book ""Ocean"". The book is split into three parts, with part two being the bulk of the book. Part Two is split into 8 sections of the Ocean including Coral Reef, The Deep, Open Ocean, Kelp Forest, Arctic, Mangroves, Oceanic Islands and Seamounts and Southern Ocean. Each section generally leads with an opening paragraph or tale by David Attenborough (captioned DA afterwards) and then leads into Colin Butfield's parts which are by far the larger parts of the book. There are also stunning photographs in each section and fun drawings throughout the book.My favourite sections were Coral Reef, The Deep, Kelp Forest and Mangroves. However every single section I found interesting and engaging. Even though sometimes I didn't learn much new information (I consume a lot of nature books/journals/programmes etc), I still really enjoyed the stories, case studies and scientific information given. ""Ocean"" tells the stories of our many underwater ecosystems whilst also going into detail on specific species, trips by David, scientific information, political issues and of course, Climate Change and how the Ocean is being affected. I adored the more zoomed in stories about specific species from sea otters eating clams to a whale carcass covered in pearl octopus and how krill feed basically everything in Antarctica! Although it can be a little depressing at times, this book does show the harsh reality of the state of our Oceans. I really hope this book makes people think more about their choices and what they can change to help save our Oceans and also our planet.My main gripe about this book is that there was quite a lot of repetition. I understand wanting to teach and force a point, however at times in Colin's sections, it became a little tiring due to the repeated information. Despite this, I have to say it was very well written and incredibly well researched. Some of the stories were brand new to me and I gobbled up that information and loved every second. Overall, a fantastic new nature book that I think a lot of people will enjoy. There is a great balance in stories and information and think it makes it very accessible for those that want to learn about the Ocean's amazing and unique ecosystems.Please note that I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.","I loved this so very much. I’ll start with why it lost a star; I’m reading on my phone (not my fave). I was fortunate enough to be selected by the publisher as an advanced reader and unfortunately the only supported format was on my phone, which I understand given how stunning the photos at the end of the book were, but if I was going to be forced to read a book on my phone I would’ve preferred that the images be scattered throughout their relevant portions of the book. Additionally, there were times that the book felt repetitive. I know it’s flipping back and forth between Attenborough and Butfield’s writing, but there are parts that feel like they are back-to-back Butfield sections that feel repetitive. For instance, CCAMLR is named, defined (mission, etc.) and shortened twice in the span of like 30 pages. But again, I also may be getting lost in the digital formatting.Overall, the book was stunning, and felt vivid, urgent and rich in the way any documentary makes you feel. I felt fully immersed in the scenes and situations outlined throughout the book. If I’m honest, this was made more enjoyable by the fact that I read in Sir David Attenborough’s voice throughout the entire thing. I often feel like it’s a difficult balance to strike in works of non-fiction where I feel like I’m learning but still having fun and not so bogged down by the minutia, and Ocean did that so well. In all of the ways I found “Sapiens” to be mind numbing and boring, I found this to be rich and engaging. I felt like I was learning something new on every page without it feeling too technical or verbose. There were some moments where I felt myself losing track or spacing out, but they were brief and we’ll attribute that to: reading on a phone, some of that repetitive nature, my own shortcomings in attentiveness, etc. etc).Another sincere thanks to Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read ahead !"
Searches: Selfhood in the Digital Age,Vauhini Vara,3.93,"if this wins the National book award for nonfiction you all have to say that I called it here first on March 20thReview from @jcgrenn_reads on Instagram:SEARCHESVauhini VaraThank you @pantheonbooks — out 4/8A smart, complicated, sweeping work studying how tech and AI function as surveillance capitalism in service of the market, but also a study in how artificial intelligence is relatable, interesting, and probably inescapable. Searches stays curious about AI and tech while it criticizes Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, X and the rest all in balanced and thoughtful essay. Vara puts herself in the ring as many of these guys were her contemporaries at the beginnings of the tech boom, and writes with grace and humor.In using ChatGPT to give feedback on her manuscript as she writes (and publishing what it has to say) Vara actively implicates herself in humanity’s allowing of the double edged sword that is technology, specifically AI. Her book comes into our hands and ears at such cost—the paper, the ink, the labor, (the water!) All the resources that create this book are ones we use daily too—Your reading of it comes at that expense as well. In a world where bookish people love to offer blanket critique and boycott of “AI” it seems many of us also have no problem using the Meta platform on our Apple products day in and day out. The book is also interesting in another layer—it allows for AI to just make no sense. An unreliable narrator of sorts, the “feedback” sections often relay some nonsense among other parts that are honestly intensely profound. The only thing scary about that is that WE THE PPL will continue to believe what we read without regard to source as we always have. In conclusion, It’s honestly refreshing to have such a “book person” be so on the pulse of all this, and to communicate it to us so clearly. Someone able to speak straight to the heart of so much we worry about with such beauty creativity and joy—that’s what we need in order to make sense and ensure equity as AI continues to creep into every facet of our lives, whether we want it or not.A brilliant piece of journalism, an honest emotional memoir, and a lovely work of art all in one among other things—If Searches wins Vara a National book award longlisting and/or another Pulitzer nod, you heard it here first.","Vauhini Vara (b. 1982) is a technology journalist and writer; she spent nearly 10 years at the Wall Street Journal covering tech companies. Her 2025 memoir, Searches, is one of the most creative, ambitious memoirs I've read in a long time. This memoir is composed of a series of largely chronological essays about the technology that's become pervasive from the '90s onwards, and how these technologies have fundamentally changed how we function in and even perceive the world. Vara focuses the lens of these stories on her own experiences, sharing intimate details about her technological life, such as her Google search history, her Adsense demographic data, her Amazon product reviews, and her chat transcripts with early versions of ChatGPT as feeds it chapters of her book and asks for feedback and reflection. One of the most powerful chapters in my opinion was chapter 10, Ghosts (adapted from this 2021 long-form article), in which she presents iterations of a very personal story she prompted ChatGPT to finish about her older sister, who died as a young adult after several years of battling Ewing sarcoma. Though the audiobook version of this chapter gets very repetitive as the same story is read repeatedly with Vara's voice narrating what she wrote and a voice actor, Anastasia Davidson, taking on what sounds like a synthetic voice narrating ChatGPT's contributions (a narrating arrangement followed throughout the book), it's a fascinating meta commentary on the creative process in our post-ChatGPT era.There are a few other reasons precluding me from 5-starring this book that also stem from its adaptation from the print/Ebook version to an audiobook (which I think overall was very thoughtfully conceptualized). Listening to Vara's very long Google search history, Amazon product reviews, and presentation of survey results about what it's like to be alive as a woman today (chapter 16, which lasts for around 1 hr 20 min and is apparently collated from Mechanical Turk surveys Vara paid women to fill out and presented largely without commentary or analysis) were like nails on a chalkboard for me. I presume these are parts of the written book that people will generally skim rather than read with interest. I also lost interest in most of the long dialogues between Vara and ChatGPT, as honestly I read enough of what ChatGPT writes that I don't need to listen to it for hours longer. I unfortunately also found Chapter 8, I am Hungry to Talk, which is presented in the audiobook as Vara narrating an Spanish language essay in the background while Davidson translates in English in real time, jarring while listening (probably as I understand some Spanish and my brain was attempting to process both languages at once).I do think Vara's analysis on on-point and important, and this memoir is worth a read and many reflections (though do as I say, not as I did, and pick up the physical book or Ebook, rather than the audiobook). And while you're at it, take a look at what demographics Google has assigned to you that influence your ad tracking, and contemplate a) how Google got that impression of you (correctly or not) based on what you inputted, and b) what it's like to live in a society where we all have this vapor trail following us around digitally. I'll share mine from my primary browser (despite largely blocking ads with add-ons) and leave fellow GR users to contemplate what's true and what's false:Relationships: MarriedHousehold income: Moderately high incomeEducation: Bachelor's degreeIndustry: Not enough infoEmployer size: Large employer (250-10,000 employees)Homeownership: HomeownersParenting: Not parents(ChatGPT was not used to write, revise, or comment on any part of this review ;) )Further reading: reflections on the digital ageFilterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture by Kyle Chayka | my reviewThe Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI by Fei-Fei Li | my reviewThe Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity by Amy WebbCo-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI by Ethan Mollick | my reviewCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia | my reviewMy statistics:Book 123 for 2025Book 2049 cumulatively","This book does what it’s trying to do well and creatively. Though opposed to AI, I thought the interspersing of AI-generated feedback between chapters was innovative. It showed the AI’s storytelling is inferior to Vara’s lived experience. A super interesting read but one I worry will lose relevance as more generative models come into being. Thank you for NetGalley and Pantheon for the ARC."
Children of Radium: A Buried Inheritance,Joe Dunthorne,3.72,"Is an inventor responsible for his or her inventions?Growing up, Joe Dunthorne believed that his family orchestrated a brave, cunning escape from the Nazis in 1935. However, the truth is much darker.As a Jewish chemist, Siegfried Merzbacher (Joe’s great-grandfather) was tapped to lead a chemical weapons program in Germany.This book delves into the morality of Siegfried’s choices. If he refused, someone else would lead the programs. While he proceeded in good faith, often experimenting on himself and his family, should he be responsible for what we know now? What about the danger of his family in the event of a catastrophe? And should he refuse, would he be put in the concentration camp located just around the corner from his apartment?The first half of this book is unique and provides a lot of food for thought. However, the last portion of the book delves into Siegfried’s sister and veers away from the main story.Further, the ending isn’t very strong, but Children of Radium would make an excellent book club pick if one wants to discuss the ethics of invention.*Thanks, Scribner, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion.The Green Light at the End of the Dock (How much I spent):Hardcover Text – Free/Nada/Zilch through publisherConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta My Bookstore at Pango","I'm gonna need a minute, Children or Radium was haunting in a way that very few books are. It was an extremely gripping read, I had a hard time pausing the audiobook because I wanted to know more. I learned quite a few things that I didn't know previously. Likewise, some events were put into perspective, now that I have more information about them.As I was listening, I kept being shocked by the things I was learning, like the radioactive toothpaste (I had no idea!), which made me dig into it deeper. I still can't believe it was actually a thing, and that people were considering it to be some kind of cure. Different times, that's for sure.Mr Dunthorne's writing style shines through, even in the audio version, as does his humour. I found myself laughing out loud multiple times. The research that went into this is very much appreciated, though I feel like there's even more to say, the book was far too short for such an interesting subject matter.I'll have to get a physical copy, this is a book worth having.","It's sometimes hard to understand the motivation for the fact that people perform nefarious things without thinking of the consequences. However, for Siegfried Merzbacher, German-Jewish chemist, this was both his life's work and a way to keep himself and his family alive in the pre Nazi era. His work in producing radium toothpaste (Doramand), proceeded to making gas masks, and then to making chemical weapons for the Nazis. For two years he did this, before escaping to Turkey with his family before the war actually started. Later, when he learned his work aided in killing Jews including his family members, he had to live with that fact for the rest of his days.Joe Dunthorne, the author, is the great grandson of Siegfried Merzbacher, and he was intent on finding and tracking down his great grandfather's story. Traveling to towns in Germany, where the soil is still irradiated, Joe tries to understand and reconcile his great grandfather's past. Using Siegfried's rambling two thousand page memoir as his guide, he attempts to absorb and deal with his family's past."
Off the Spectrum: Why the Science of Autism Has Failed Women and Girls,Gina Rippon,3.99,"female-centred book on autism by an actual neurobiologist i manifested this, excellently written and i will be getting my hands on a physical copy. the more i learn about female history in regards to autism the angrier i get.","✨ Thanks to NetGalley and Seal Press for providing a digital version of this book in exchange for an honest review.For years, we heard that autism was mostly a ""boy's thing."" Sure, girls could be autistic too, but they were seen as outliers. What if we were wrong? What if we couldn't find as many autistic girls simply because we weren't looking for them?This book is written by a neuroscientist, so it comes with actual science, which was sometimes a bit tough to read (I found the behavioral part easier to digest than the neuroscience one, but that's just me). It was fascinating—and depressing—to see how girls are being failed at every step. They don't get as many referrals, and when they finally see a specialist, the tests meant to diagnose them miss the mark because they're designed for autistic boys. No diagnosis means no support. And it goes on and on because all the data we use for diagnosis is based on those already diagnosed (boys).Here's a little story time: I'm one of those girls, even if I'm a woman now, obviously. I got tested and the results said, ""Well, you don't meet our threshold, but you meet enough criteria for us to think you're not neurotypical."" That's probably the worst answer to get. Now it's too late for me as an older millennial, but if things could change for the girls and women coming after me, that would be enough. The part about the tests (there's one set used basically everywhere to diagnose) was weirdly validating for me (even if it won't give me a diagnosis), so I'd like to thank the author for that.It's also a super interesting read if you're into learning about how research works and how science constantly recalibrates itself. We learn along the way and make changes. It was really cool to see this process in the context of autism research.","Vote: 3.4Disclaimer: is not a full 4 stars only because by background I am a neuroscientist so I found the neuroscience part a bit too simple for me personally (which on the other hand is also one of the strengths of this book though).I quite enjoyed the book. First of all, I was absolutely not aware of the gender issues within autism, also, despite being transmasc myself, I did not know about how higher the rates are for trans people.I found the book very well written, especially for a non-expert audience. It is rare to come across scientists that are able to be detailed but understandable enough in their writing when they produce a book on their topic of expertise. The book is accessible both to a larger audience and to an audience of experts, while not boring the latter. It adds another evidence to the pile of evidences that show how research and science and medicine overall have been tailored around the needs of cisgender white men, and how this approach has left undiagnosed and untreated all those who did not fit in the box developed for them. Most importantly, the book left me with a lot of curiosity and the interest to look further into the topic, and I love when my interest is triggered to the point I want to expand my knowledge even beyond what I read.I do think some of the sentences in the part talking about autism among transgender people could have been phrased better, but overall the topic was handled graciously and efficiently in my opinion."
Proto: How One Ancient Language Went Global,Laura Spinney,4.28,"Fascinating, well-researched book. In Proto, author Laura Spinney (with assists from the various other academicians she mentions by name throughout) takes a sweeping, multidisciplinary approach to historical linguistics, attempting to trace the origin, spread, and evolution of the vast Indo-European language family from its ancient beginnings through to modern times. Because of the sometimes meandering nature of the writing -- and the topic itself -- I occasionally had a hard time keeping track of which bits are solid fact (such as DNA analysis of human remains from different archaeological sites), which bits are widely-accepted points of agreement, and which bits are still mainly theoretical, but I was thoroughly engrossed and learned things I never knew I needed to know about the history of Eurasia. I've been both entertained and educated!** I received a Review Copy of this book via NetGalley **(May 2025 Bloomsbury edition)","This book was fascinating and extremely well researched. Overall, it was a little too academic and in the weeds for me. I love languages and history, but at times this felt too granular. There were a lot of interesting tidbits that I will remember!Thank you to libro.fm for my ALC.","3.5 I have an interest in the topics of early human history and language development and found the data in this book compelling and digestible, but the presentation and organization did not blow me away. Especially in audio format, I found myself zoning out when there weren’t clear and consistent connections made to thread the two topics of culture and language. Still, an enjoyable experience, though unfortunately not one I will likely remember long-term. Thank you to libro.fm for the free educator ALC."
"So Very Small: How Humans Discovered the Microcosmos, Defeated Germs—and May Still Lose the War Against Infectious Disease",Thomas Levenson,4.44,"This standout book of 2025 is a triumph of science writing, blending rigorous research with an approachable style that welcomes readers regardless of their biochemistry knowledge. It’s a compelling exploration of scientific discovery, human flaws, and our place in a microbial world.Key ThemesNonlinear Scientific Progress: The narrative traces the erratic arc of breakthroughs. It took centuries to link microbes to disease after the microscope’s invention, yet the COVID-19 vaccine emerged in months, showcasing science’s unpredictable leaps.Human Bias as a Barrier: Dogma—whether religious, political, or scientific—often stifles progress. Paraphrasing Max Planck, the book notes that science advances “one funeral at a time,” as new ideas battle entrenched beliefs.Collective Responsibility vs. Hubris: The text critiques those who reject vaccines or quarantines for personal freedom, endangering society. It reinforces a vital truth: what benefits the group ultimately benefits the individual.Favorite Quote“We coexist with billions of our own kind and a vastly greater number of other living forms with evolutionary interests of their own.” This line encapsulates the humbling reality of our shared existence with microbes.","An interesting work of popular science/history of medicine that follows the centuries-long saga of germ theory - from the discovery of germs themselves, to their first identification as the source of disease, to the era of antibiotics and current problems with them. It is a neat and comprehensive story, told through the lives and work of many scientists, both famous and lesser known, and their patients.But I have to admit that I was a bit surprised and disappointed that the author completely ignores the topic of bacteriophages, which are 1) fascinating 2) the most promising alternative to antibiotics. So I recommend to combine this book with another one, The Living Medicine: How a Lifesaving Cure Was Nearly Lost―and Why It Will Rescue Us When Antibiotics Fail by Lina Zeldovich , which focuses on bacteriophages.Thanks to the publisher, Random House, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.","This book explores the centuries-long journey to understand the role of germs in disease, revealing how human biases and overconfidence hindered scientific progress. From the discovery of microbes to the antibiotic era and beyond, it examines the interplay between hubris, human ingenuity, and our understanding of the microbial world.This book is informative, entertaining, and sometimes heart-wrenching. The progress of medicine during the nineteenth century was painfully slow, as this book demonstrates, and far too many lives were lost that could have been saved if people had trusted evidence rather than tradition. The book also stresses the importance of humility as we’re faced with the evolution of drug-resistant strains of infectious diseases, now and in the future.Thanks, NetGalley, for the ARC I received. This is my honest and voluntary review."

Ancestors: Identity and DNA in the Levant,"Pierre Zalloua, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (introduction)",4.19,"Super interesting topic. I’m a biochemist with a special interest in genetics and genealogy, and this book was a very fascinating read. Even though I feel like the flow was kind of off and dragged a lot through a few parts, it was awesome to see how Zalloua was able to interweave the science and genetics with history to try and trace the origins and evolution of the levant throughout time. This is a work of nonfiction, but at certain points throughout the book, it reads like prose, the words woven together so beautifully that you couldn’t decipher it as “scientific text”. I was really impressed with that.Zalloua, of Lebanese origin, doesn’t particularly believe in the idea of “ethnicity”, and leads us, as the reader around to the idea of how and why it is different from our genetic ancestry. To juxtapose that, he also talks about our identities and how they are forged by the people around us and our culture… especially for those who are indigenous to the Levant. He even brings up the shadiness of genetic testing companies and their somewhat ambivalent code of ethics, which I think is ESPECIALLY relevant to what’s happening now with 23 and me going down and the millions of peoples private DNA genomes going down with it. Zalloua essentially predicts the impact and implications of it here first. I would give this a 3.8/5 because lowkey this book put me into a slump but it was definitely worth reading for me","This is a history of the Middle East and the Levant, with a special focus on Lebanon, told from the perspective of population genetics. It tells the story of waves of migration, beginning with the emergence of modern humans, and the formation of distinct communities through their DNA, attempting to combine broad accessibility with scholarly rigor. (For example, the flow of the narrative is uninterrupted by endnote numbers, but then the notes section contains all the additional details and citations, traceable by key phrases.)The book juxtaposes rather dry, textbook-like sections that tell the story of the spread of certain ancient genetic signatures, and very lively stories dominated by the author's personality, such as his attempt to collect some DNA from isolated populations in Chad to make a point about the concept of indigeneity, or to find some ""Phoenician"" artifacts in the National Museum of Lebanon.I wasn't entirely convinced by the structure of the book, including this combination of such stylistically different segments and some misleading signposting (e.g. it is suggested that the general outline of Levantine history will be told in a few thousand words, leaving the reader to expect that we will then move on to some central issue, when in fact most of the book is the outline of Levantine history). Also, there are some moments of sloppy writing that can be misleading to those who don't already know what's going on (e.g., the Eastern Roman Empire was not replaced by Byzantium as a different power/state, it's the same thing, and Central Asia is not between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea). But it was interesting and I learned a lot.Thanks to the publisher for providing me with a free eARC through Netgalley. Publication date April 29, 2025.","As a Lebanese of Maronite descent, I was longing to read such a book. It answers questions we’ve been carrying for years - questions that rarely find answers in mainstream discourse. This work offers a perspective so often overlooked, yet so essential to understanding ourselves and our history. And the ending which hides a surprise; was exactly what I needed. I find it so fascinating that Pierre decoded his genome—giving him the ability to understand his ancestry and the stories it carries with much more clarity. Despite the author’s adversity toward current consumer DNA testing companies, I’m still interested to decode my own genetic making to unravel the history of my own ancestors. What I appreciated most about this book is its ability to place pan-Arab and other pan-nationalist identities in their proper marginal context. It powerfully challenges dominant narratives by showing how these ideologies often rest on fragile foundations. Particularly striking is how the book debunks the myth that the Phoenicians originated from the Arabian Peninsula. Zalloua draws on both genetic evidence and historical geography to highlight the implausibility of such claims—especially in light of early human migrations out of Africa, which moved into the Levant through the Sinai, not the Arabian interior."
"More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity",Adam  Becker,4.20,"I like when smart people explain, in very scientific but accessible terms, exactly why Elon is a dumbass.","...or, how to con a billionaire.This is a beautiful mess of a book. It is a critique, really a polemic, of Silicon Valley. Yet it is not limited to Silicon Valley in any scope. It uses individuals, usually those associated with Silicon Valley, as a way to focus its discussion.It is about Futurism, but not in general, and not exclusive. It is about an ethos, associated with Silicon Valley and the wealthiest of its cohort. This ideology always has some relationship with Futurism. It often has a relationship with Rationalism. Dropped into a closing footnote is TESCREAL, standing for “Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singulatarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and Longtermism” a cluster that frustrates my computer’s spell checker in its and per the author, is more of a ‘yo dawg, I heard you liked jargon’ ism-orgy. Maybe sum it up as ‘Why the Rich are Wrong.""The chapters are grouped by concept. Largely about potential futures, such as extra-planetary (or -solar) exploitation, General AI, and Existential AI risk, they also include chapters on things like Rationalism or Effective Altruism. It describes each, usually using one of its figures as a framing device, then brings in the critics to elaborate on the feet of clay each has. The book is a great example of where the last chapter ought to have been the first. The introduction and first few chapters come off as a series of independent essays. Patterns arise, and are paid off in the conclusion, where the author talks about those patterns. The journalistic qualities here are unimpeachable. The author does the work that so few have, in finding credentialed responses or knowledgeable complaints. Most writers on these subjects perform more of a Naked Emperor act, frequently with an exhortation to touch grass. This book takes them seriously as a threat, and finds people who are capable to engage them: think “here is why the math is wrong.” This is invaluable. It does the work that allows you, dear reader, to do the same and talk to someone who holds one or many of these beliefs and provide a substantive argument.The author manages to include interviews with many of the figures here. These are impressive, not takedowns or gotchas, but doing what a good interview should do in allowing someone to present a reasoned articulation of their ideas, while providing what the reader needs to vet those ideas. It is too bad that more of the people did not accept an interview request as all the people interviewed come off better than they appear from the facts, maybe still wrong but still reasonable.I do not feel bad about burying the lede here as the book itself does it, but the thesis is that the futurism of contemporary silicon valley is evil. The surprise is always racism: eugenics, specifically. The philosophy amounts to the idea that colonialism is great, but real colonialism has never been tried.It is extreme to write it that plainly. It is not. The bigotry and old-timey wrongness here is not hidden in dog whistles. It is not merely that the originators of the ideas were wrong, but now we can separate the good parts from the bad. Rather, the book has the receipts. The number of shocking quotes from public figures will leave you irate at the U.S. media. Not since Postman have I been upset in this way.(The funny aside is that, Character Limit established that Musk has one plan. He used it in Twitter and is using it as Czar. But the “One Plan” is not limited to Musk, as others like Andreessen share it. Not the having one plan, and not that one plan being something that would make the Elders of Zion blush but dressed up all capitalisty. They all have the same plan. They all want to be the same sort of global government. I feel that the only reason why the whole tech sector does not realize it is one massive Molotov-Ribbentrop scenario is how under-reported some of this is.)There are two problems. The first is that the book is inconsistent in its evisceration from a structural sense. It feels more like a reference book than an consistent take, as different topics get different degrees of scrutiny, most notably the ones with too much rather than too little.The second is a few bad arguments on the part of the author. I am omitting them from the review. It is a polemic, and should be read in that spirit as someone out to make a point (but I will probably blog on them and link that here). The one one that I must mention is, comparable to the ""poetically true"" of the previous book is when the author has a ‘just [expletive] Google it moment. I mean, I understand that they are not here to educate me OH WAIT THEY ARE THIS IS A NON-FICTION BOOK I PICKED UP TO DO JUST THAT. Worse, the underlying assertion is, as far as I understand, “aggressively technically correct.” It is right, but through reductive phrasing. It would have been better as a citation to someone else. I feel like I overuse the 'if you are like me, you will love this book' formula, so let me be precise. This book fills a need. It is not unique in doing so, but it is rare. If you want a detailed exploration of the contrary position to contemporary futurism, this is ideal. It is clear to read and well-sourced investigation. As an introduction it is scattershot; as a manifesto its call to action needs developing, and as a persuasive text it will not change hearts and minds. It is still cool and readable.My thanks to the author, Adam Becker, for writing the book, and to the publisher, Basic Books, for making the ARC available to me.","In many ways, More Everything Forever is the angry rant that all sensible people want to hear right now. The consolidation of power that is happening in Big Tech and the AI space in particular is frightening because of the clear lack of empathy and compassion that its leaders show the world. The book is at its best when it is skewering so many of the single-minded concepts that drive the extremely rich to believe that they have the answers for everything. Really, that only answer is more, better, faster technology.Becker rightly points out that the celebration of focus, business progress, and action we see from many of these technology leaders is always coupled with a suspicion of the humanities and fulfilling the goal of a college education to make a person whole. It is indeed this lack of an education in art, literature, history, the social sciences, and philosophy beyond reading Golden Age science fiction and possibly the creepy works of Ayn Rand that makes so many of these tech billionaires believe that every solution is technological. While he misses this moment’s weird Silicon Valley shift further right and into religious sensibilities that probably slipped more starkly into the light after he finished composing the book, this discussion is where the book is most astute.While Becker speaks the language of so many of the subcultures of futurists, it does feel like he sometimes discounts the value of an idea because they are being applied in a ham-fisted way by people who lack any concern about the comity of man. While this longtime science fiction reader appreciates him unpacking the value of this genre for its speculative power, he denounces its value based on the authors rather than the ideas, writers from a certain moment in time, and whose values may not align with our own. Just because a bunch of billionaires choose to read a certain novel only for how they seem to inform their personal philosophy, it certainly doesn’t mean these books don’t have value and that they have not formed the building blocks to get us to future works that provide an enormous amount of value. I’m not going to discount the value that Isaac Asimov had in advancing our way of thinking about robotics (and so much more) just because he had some views and took some actions that are not aligned with modern morality. The book does the same with long-term thinking in general, but that’s a larger subject to unpack that warrants a future blog post.Those quibbles aside, the book shines brightest when creating effective arguments against the assertions of extremely rich people who believe that their business success means they understand exactly how the future should be built. Becker is correct in saying that we cannot take directly from science fiction to plan the future. Many genre books are cautionary, and deeply misreading them seems to be more popular these days than ever before. His points here are thoughtful and useful for those engaged in direct discussion about how we need to weigh the value of long-term planning against the opportunity cost for helping people right now.I’m reluctant to criticize the book too much for its shortcomings because we need this perspective. His intense dislike for What We Owe The Future is warranted and well-explained, even if mocking actor Joseph-Gordon Leavitt for his tearful read of the tome might be a trifle mean.When Becker concludes that - Spoiler Alert - the fact that we have 3,000 people working hard to get further up the Forbes Billionaires list is the crux of the problem, he’s provided ample evidence. This extreme inequality being celebrated while we know people are starving, climate change is going to affect the poor disproportionately, and the breakdown of democracy is in full swing means we need to act. His simple acknowledgment that we used to have a sensible approach called progressive taxation that made sure people didn’t become too powerful and power-mad is salient.While addressing this issue is important, the book leaves solutions to the reader. That’s fair, although I don’t think we need to throw the concept of space travel out the window because we know that there are so many problems on Earth. Solving the problem of extreme wealth inequality should allow us to do both, with a deep focus on solving immediate problems, and not just dreaming that all problems will be solved in the future by the advent of technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence.Definitely a thoughtful book and one worth reading..Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for access to an ARC."
What's Left: Three Paths Through the Planetary Crisis,Malcolm   Harris,3.93,"I understand that there are benefits of being exposed to different ways of thinking, but I can't say that makes it any easier to wrap my mind around new ideas, ... and maybe I'm just at a point in my life (and thinking) where it's difficult to accept ... ah, but therein lies the rub ... what exactly is it that my mind can't wrap itself around?This is pretty dense stuff, and maybe it'll seize the public consciousness, but much as I enjoyed the fact that, while reading it, it made me think and reminded me of lots of things I've studied, ... indeed, as I read, I couldn't help but think about Harari's exceptional offering, Sapiens, ... and, yes, I found myself agreeing with innumerable points, but, ultimately, I was unwilling to buy into the whole. (But, not to belabor the point ... it did make me think and, yes, rethink many of my day-to-day assumptions.)And, no, this isn't fair, but when it was all said and done, my biggest takeaway is that: if Harris is right about what it will require for us ... our communities and our governments ... and the world ... to not only rise to meet, but actually do what needs to be done to confront the accelerating challenges associated with the climate crisis, then, well, we're doomed. Alas. But that's my take.I expect it would be easier to sit around and discuss the book rather than to attempt to craft a cohesive review, so I think I'll just suggest that this might be the perfect book for you if you're interested in (at least two of the following three) climate change, economics, and communism, and you've progressed along the climate change doomer curve from Oreskes & Conways' compact (but powerful) The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future to Wallace-Wells' at-this-point-iconic The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming to Boyd's migraine-inducing I Want a Better Catastrophe: Navigating the Climate Crisis with Grief, Hope, and Gallows Humor and, along the way, you found yourself unpersuaded by the more hope-oriented literature ... including, say, Hayhoe's Saving Us: A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World, and now you were looking for a counterargument to Hsu's Capitalism and the Environment: A Proposal to Save the Planet, or, even if you agree with Raworth's Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist or Mazzucato's Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism, you just don't think they're roadmaps for addressing the challenges ahead.I bought and read this (very) soon after it hit the bookstore shelves, influenced in part by this NYT review - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/bo... - which, to my mind, accurately describes the book and, in retrospect, probably should have persuaded me not to buy/read it, but ... somehow managed to do exactly the opposite. For context, that review artfully distilled it all down to this: “What’s Left” is painful to read. Not because it is poorly written, or wrongheaded, or inadequately researched — but because its rationalism and its futurism belong to an era, an epoch, a framing that is no longer ours. Of course we may still prefer to discuss bold and sensible solutions. We probably should. But we have to reckon with a present reality that is not just more dangerous, but heading in a worse direction.As I spend my days waffling between doom and hope, naively (and optimistically?) searching for a path to something better for - not just my kids and students (and former students), but - the next generation and beyond, I can't say I found the answer here. But that doesn't mean I'll stop looking (or reading).","I have ready many books for over a decade about the very real, urgent crisis of global change and have mixed feelings after reading this book. The book is divided up in chapters dealing with clinate change from the socialist, progressive and revolutionary POVs and further building on what solutions could be from those perspectives. It is the author's POV that all three of those strategies have to come together for action to happen. Whoever is in charge of these decisions for the future of the planet, there defintely needs to be compromise! This part of the book works well.However, there is a lot of assumption from the author about global change being reduced if these strategies work together at some point. I also feel that I did not learn much new information to what I have already read over the years about this catatrophic issue. From POV, I hope I am long past deceased before the planet gets bad, but it is already happening.Recommended for those wanting to know more about global climate change.Thanks to Netgalley, Malcolm Harris, Little Brown & Company for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.Available: 4/15/25","First things first, shout out to Kayleigh George with Little, Brown and Company for the ARC. I GROVELED for an ARC of this book because Malcolm Harris is a thinker I deeply admire and I’ve loved all of his books.

Bird School: A Beginner in the Wood,Adam Nicolson,4.83,"Not only are the ""wood cuts"" AI, they're not the correct birds.",This is a truly special book ; a beautiful exploration into the world of birds.A mediation on the world of our avian neighbours Adam Nicholson decides to take a closer look at the birds around him on his Sussex farm and educate himself into their world.What follows is an incredible read ; the daily habits; the migratory patterns; nesting ; survival ; scientific and biological studies - composed with heart and vital details to educate and inform.Chapters are broken down into specific birds and bird types - birds we are familiar with ( if you are of certain generations ) and the rise and decline of certain species.The recognition of birdsong ( I’m now addicted to the Merlin app as well) and the beauty of every bird.This is a book for beginners in birdwatching but I’m sure will provide further information for already established watchers.The wonder and beauty of birds astounds but there is also a call to arms - a need for us to recognise the perilous nature that birds are under; the decimation of their habitats and food . The impact of climate change and man’s ever changing desires to control all around highlights further concerns for the future of birds - the statistics are horrifying But at the heart of this book is the desire to help us all appreciate the special and fragile relationship we have with the feathered community around us.Highly recommended - a natural history book of 2025,"Returning this one without starting it and I was so excited initially. The ARC had ai generated image(s) that advance readers identified and gave the publisher crap for, rightly so. The publisher replaced the offending image for the general retail release, but I'm no longer interested in dedicating my limited time to a book that may or may not be using real images of birds. There's a few 'public domain' and 'stock' photos printed in black and white at such a close crop that I honestly cannot tell if it's a real photo or not. You can find a bit of the discussion around this on bluesky if you look for the author's name, the book title, and the word images. Considering the fortunes of the author and the publisher, you'd think they could have swung the cost of legitimate artists and photographers' work for a book about appreciating the natural world in its full context instead of falling for the trap of 'the tyranny of the view'. Oh, the irony. It's so loud, it's drowning out the dawn chorus."
"Rethinking Medications: Truth, Power, and the Drugs You Take",Jerry Avorn,3.30,"This started out as a 5-star read for me, but about halfway through it lost its way. Instead of focusing on the pharmaceutical industry and its issues, it turned into a memoir of the author's medical career. Then the author's political views took over, and factual objectivity went out the window in favor of weasel words such as ""likely,"" ""anticipated,"" ""expected,"" etc. Also, after describing the failures of the FDA and other consumer-protection agencies in the first half of the book, the solutions presented involved more government agencies and more money and more studies and more regulation--all stuff he showed didn't work in the first half of the book. I definitely recommend reading the first half of the book. Unfortunately, the second half dragged its rating down to 3 stars for me.","Hai guys!

The Mind Electric: A Neurologist on the Strangeness and Wonder of Our Brains,Pria Anand,4.35,"I love the way Anand wove her story within stories of different neuro diseases. Her opinions of how the medical community overworks their employees, how doctors seem to be treating patients as problems and annoyances, and in turn how people may prevent getting treatment or think that they’re over reacting. If you’re a fan of Oliver Sacks, you’d like this one.Thank you Atria Books and Net Galley for an advanced copy of this book.","In “The Mind Electric”, neurologist and author Pria Anand has crafted a work that blends the genres of memoir and medical nonfiction that centers on the miracles and eccentricities of our brains.While the book is loosely structured across different neurological conditions and symptoms, I found that there was much more meandering across different topics and perspectives than I’d initially believed. Anand opens with “The Theater of Illness”, going back through history to the (incorrect) diagnoses and treatment of diseases, and the skewed perception of female “hysteria” the related symptoms it was associated with. From there, she weaves through a number of different neurological conditions and illnesses, including epilepsy, sleep paralysis, kuru, anxiety, delusions, schizophrenia, and pain (both the experience and the medical treatment for it). In between, Anand shares her experiences as both a patient (during her own pregnancy and as woman of color in the US), a medical resident experiencing sleep deprivation and the endless deluge of patients and illnesses, and as an established physician. She also dives into the history of medicine, exploring different illnesses and breakthroughs that have emerged over time, and the dated racial and gender-based assumptions that still persist today in medicine.Anand’s writing is clear, precise, and descriptive; especially in a work of scientific nonfiction, the storytelling was central and suitable for readers of all different academic backgrounds. I found the balance between more personal and emotional experiences well-juxtaposed to the more academic and educational topics, encouraging a natural flow across each chapter.Very much a recommended read when “The Mind Electric” is published in June 2025!","This was an engaging and moving collection of medical tales by Anand, a hospital neurologist, about the diseases that can and do affect the human brain. It is told partly in case study, in fable, in history, and in autobiographical memoir. I liked the duality the author weaved as both clinical physician and narrative storyteller, taking readers on a journey that explored the strange, complex, and often debilitating diseases that can afflict patients and their brains. She isn't shy about discussing how peculiar symptoms - particularly those voiced by women, minorities, and displaced or impoverished people - were or have been summarily dismissed as ""hysteria"" at the start. Or are/were foisted off as psychological problems like stress, anxiety, or delusion. It was also fascinating to learn about the various disorders that can attack the brain, from everything from epilepsy, to facial blindness, to vision loss, to dementia etc. It's definitely worth a read if you're at all interested in the complexity of the human brain.Thank you to NetGalley and Atria Books for the ARC in exchange for my review.BOOK BLOG"

"My Oceans: Essays of Water, Whales, and Women",Christina   Rivera,4.64,"Christina Rivera writes with poetic precision and fearless honesty, crafting every sentence with intention and care. Every.single.sentence in this book is stunning and intentional!!! Her voice moves fluidly between the personal and the collective—inviting us into stories of motherhood, loss, and womanhood while drawing unflinching parallels to the grief of a world in ecological crisis. She gives voice to the natural world in a way that feels both urgent and sacred, reminding us of our deep entanglement with it. She has written a soul-stirring invocation that encourages us to feel more deeply, and to live awake. It’s one of those rare reads that brings you back home to yourself and reminds you of your greater responsibility to non-human world. Give it to everyone you know!!!!","How to describe this book? How to provide a short summary?Rivera’s writing is like her surname, a riverbank, with water always in sight, always at hand, the fauna and the flora, the ecosystems living in harmony, the sounds echoing in their natural rhythm.This is one of the best essay books and one of the few on the junction of climate science and motherhood that I have ever read.Rivera’s writing style and how she shapes her essays into stories that connect and inform each other are impressive.She masterfully blends topics involving the ecosystems, the climate crisis, the collective errrs when we see someone subject to violence and injustice, grief, her anecdotes, important facts about whales and oceans and gives us this relevant. engaging and important book.Any minor and brief disengagement for a smaller part of a much larger topic, maybe a couple of paragraphs or so were due to my own disinterest. Even in those moments, I kept reading, and had a reflective, informing, illuminating experience.Rivera’s wonderful at her craft and she is able to evoke emotion, and invite the reader to critical and analytical thinking without the tediousness of fact heavy writing.Thank you to #netgalley and the publisher for the ARC.","You know those books that when you sense you’re nearing the end, you take a minute and just hold the book to your chest, keeping yourself from finishing the story for just a little while longer? The books that make you sad that they’re over when you finally do close them? This is one of those. This book of essays is part climate science, part memoir and it’s just beautiful.Rivera takes the powerful love we know as mothers and turns it toward the sea. It’s evident that both of these loves are ones experienced divemaster and mother of two, Rivera, knows well.Each essay is in turn fun to read, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking. In a time when it’s easy to zoom out and ignore the world around us in favor of daily tasks or doom scrolling, Rivera’s essays caused me to zoom back in and take a hard look. A couple of them made me feel like I’d just gotten the wind knocked out of me.The result, for me, is a feeling that won’t leave my chest just yet.It’s a good thing then, that I can tell that these are stories I will visit again and again as I continue to contemplate what it means to mother during a time of climate crisis (and explore my newfound love and appreciation of manta rays!)"
"Uncommon Measure: A Journey Through Music, Performance, and the Science of Time",Natalie Hodges,3.52,"I loved Natalie Hodges' narrative approach in her memoir. As a young girl, all Hodges wanted to be was a violin soloist. Practicing diligently for five and six hours a day, up until the wee hours of the morning, her life was consumed by music. Twenty years later, her professional quest has become unlikely, and she has to cast about for another way to live. In the maelstrom of this decision, Hodges takes up the writing of this memoir.This book is so tantalizing. Hodges marches through quantum physics and the science of time, suggesting that we may be able to change our relationship with the past by writing about it. I'm willing to consider this as long as the facts stay true. Sometimes what's needed is a new perspective. She writes about music's connectivity with the flow of time:""Music sculpts time. Indeed, it is a structuring of time, as a layered arrangement of audible temporal events."" Time and thinking process are some of the greatest challenges Hodges faced during performances. She found herself obsessing over making errors and true to her fears, she often would.  ""If you can't get into that flow--if your nerves get the best of you and you're dragged onto the shore of self-consciousness--well, chances are you'll mess up that tricky run . . . The flow is staunched, the fabric rent; you feel punched in the gut, knocked out of the music's time and back into your own. And then, afterward, you can feel the seconds and minutes passing; you trudge through, it's all linear, you just want it to be over, you just want to make it to the end."" Although I'm not a musician, I can sympathize with her performance anxiety. I hate public speaking but have a huge admiration for those composed souls who speak so well in front of groups. Now, I have a new appreciation for the musician who has put hours and years of practice into their performances. Hodges explores the improvisation of Gabriela Montero, a celebrated pianist, and the brain studies that show her brain is working differently than the brains of those who deliver practiced performances. Incredibly fascinating! She enlightened me on Bach's Chaconne in D minor, which she describes as one of the most difficult pieces a violinist can play. I listened to it on youtube. I'm not a classical connoisseur. To me, it didn't sound beautiful, but the more I listened, the more compelling it became. Some say Bach wrote this as a memorial for his first wife, Maria Barbara, who died while Bach was away from home. Hodges explains that this has been largely debunked, but still the story persists, perhaps because of the deep emotion, perhaps grief that hangs heavy within the Chaconne. And her chapter on the tango. Exquisite! A delightful memoir, Hodges relates her relationship with her Korean mother and her father. The story of her life with her parents and her music is the counterpoint melody throughout this beautiful work. I'm always happy to see beautifully written prose, and whether you're familiar with classical music or quantum physics is of no matter; this is skillful, eloquent prose with clarity of thought that provoked my curiosity at every turn.","I actually bought this book for my wife rather than myself. She is the musician in the family and devoted many hours learning to play the piano from an early age through college. But I ended up reading this first. It is a memoir of the role that music played in the author’s life. Her mother had loved playing the violin as a girl, and while she encouraged and supported Natalie, she did not force the violin on Natalie or demand the amount of time and effort that Natalie put into the instrument. This is a girl chasing her dream. She was certainly very dedicated and disciplined in the chasing of that dream. It was the parts of the memoir about Natalie’s relationship with her mother and her instructors that I enjoyed most. There were sections in which Natalie delved into the relationship between music, improvisation, time and quantum physics that were not as engaging for me. I did see how writing this book was helpful to Natalie in understanding what music represented to her.","Natalie Hodges started playing the violin at age three and after numerous performances and awards, she has altered her path in her mid 20s and decided to take a step back from her career as a soloist. This is her story.With support from her mother and three other siblings, Natalie has been surrounded by music and the love for her violin just about all of her life. It wasn’t uncommon for her to play five to six hours a day – sometimes until 2 a.m. – when she was growing up. She was inseparable from her violin. However, she started to question after practicing complicated pieces over and over again why she would continue to make mistakes in the same place of the music especially on stage. She began to have doubts in college about her ability to continue as a soloist. It didn’t help when a teacher told her she didn’t have much of a chance. Her mother (pegged as a Korean Tiger Mom) was a Harvard graduate in English and went to law school. She became a prosecutor and administrative law judge. She spent a lot of time helping her children to excel in academics and classical music. When Natalie asked her “When you quit (violin her senior year in High School)…how did you know?” She said, “I think you just know, if and when it is time. For you, the important thing is that you don’t regret and the important thing is that you choose.” Natalie discovered in her college years that it wasn’t easy to leave something that you’ve surrounded yourself with. “Why keep trying to love something that doesn’t love you back.” She now had a sense of “empty time” in her life and had to go through some adjustments.It’s a short book with 179 pages but it takes some time to digest and could be one of those books that you’d want to read over again to pick up some other thoughts that may have been missed. She reveals personal thoughts on prejudice with a Korean mom and relationships with her father. This is an interesting book especially for musicians like her that try to make sense out of their performances. Natalie said after a while, “I began to experience a unity of body and mind…I felt them working together in a rhythmic tandem.” Through interviews and research, she has now taken music to a new level through science --- letting go of control and trusting your body with a connection to others.After reading this book, I had to google Natalie Hodges with one of her violin performances; it was pure joy. I’m sure her talents have touched a lot of people."
The Serviceberry: Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World,"Robin Wall Kimmerer, John Burgoyne (illustrator)",4.37,"Goddamn it. I’m going to have to buy this audiobook and use it as comfort blanket when I need to go for a long walk to get away from the world. If I log this more than 20 times this summer, you can reach out to ask if I’m okay.","Gift Economy 101…Preamble: --It always gives me a great thrill to see talented thinkers/communicators from diverse backgrounds bring their gifts to address today’s escalating global crises; indeed, it’s a responsibility. --Kimmerer, a Potawatomi botanist who wrote the 2013 best-seller Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants, has now brought her indigenous and ecological lenses to also consider how the (social) world works (and fails). Thus, the obvious tools to consider (and challenge!) is in political economy:i) “politics”: group decision-making, see the foundational video series “What is Politics?”ii) “economy”: society’s production/distribution/reproduction: Talking to My Daughter About the Economy: or, How Capitalism Works—and How It Fails--My goal here is to cheer on this direction by highlighting the frameworks and (since it's a very short book) add further connections… Highlights: 1) Indigenous Animism vs. Colonial Commodification: --Kimmerer cites anthropology describing indigenous communities where the “currency” is relationships. We can add to this the anthropology on egalitarianism as a group adaptation protecting individual liberties against domination (challenging the myth of equality vs. liberty: Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior) and the centrality of care (Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding). --In contrast, capitalism colonized such relations with its viral drive to severe us from the web of life, rendering “the environment” as inanimate “natural resources” with no (market) value until it is commodified (privatized/extracted and sold). Long-term communal relations (i.e. community) is colonized into market exchanges, which are instantaneous transactions between strangers (see Graeber’s fabulous Debt: The First 5,000 Years). --Given the anthropology that every human society can trace back to indigenous relations, we can add that Western Europe’s capitalism didn’t just colonize foreign lands; it had to colonize its own indigenous relations through “primitive accumulation” (the original accumulation birthing capitalism) violently privatizing land/“Commons” via the “Enclosures” (creating the land market). The dispossessed lost their connections to land/community and were forced into wage labour in “dark, Satanic mills” (William Blake, 1804) (creating the labour market). …Communal medieval relations (“golden age of the European proletariat” 1350-1500, age of “feast days”/festivals, anti-feudal/anti-commercial social movements) were crushed and branded as heresies (including targeting women in witch-hunts): Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation--It only makes sense that such direct and deep everyday “indigenous” relations in the web of life are coded in cultural values of responsibility/gratitude (Kimmerer’s “indigenous world-view”), where our surroundings become animate. We still long for this as we continue to be enchanted by stories; the most obvious being stories featuring magic (ex. The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Babel), which directly reanimates the world around us. 2) Cooperative Abundance vs. Manufactured Scarcity: --Kimmerer asks: “what is economics, anyway?”. Note: mainstream economics, “the dismal science”, is merely one school (lens) of economic thought, i.e. Neoclassical economics, the one most convenient for capitalists: Economics: The User's Guide.--Kimmerer notes that scarcity is at the center of Neoclassical economics. Price requires scarcity. Nature provides an abundance of clean air, which is essential for survival (“use-value”) but its abundance means no price can be charged (“exchange-value”, capitalism’s value system). …Until we pollute the air so much that we need to buy clean air. Thus, Kimmerer points out capitalism’s “manufactured scarcity” (artificial scarcity). We can think back to colonization's dispossession of land (modern example: Why Can't You Afford a Home?), rendering people dependent on capitalism’s wage labour/debt. Kimmerer: […] because I have not thought much about economics since my introduction to it in high school decades ago, I realized that I had just been accepting the principle of scarcity as if it were a natural fact.…Kimmerer refers to the Algonquian concept of the “Wendigo”, the spirit of insatiable cannibalistic hunger. We can connect this to our crisis of addiction/ alienation: The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness, and Healing in a Toxic Culture--In contrast to manufactured scarcity, Kimmerer considers cooperative abundance through relations in the Commons. For a debunking of the “Tragedy of the Commons” (which conveniently assumes capitalist individualism and no communications), see Mexie’s video.…Kimmerer provides indigenous examples of Commons stewardship: the “Dish With One Spoon” treaty, as well as the general principle of the Honorable Harvest (coding care into the value system): i) learn about nature’s care-takers, so you can take care of themii) introduce yourself, be accountable for your request, ask for permission, abide by the answeriii) never take the first/last, take only what’s needed/given, never take more than half; leave for others, harvest via minimal harmiv) use responsibly, never waste, sharev) give thanks, reciprocate care--Kimmerer’s general examples include care-work (citing Genevieve Vaughan; we can add Folbre’s The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values), information Commons (from public libraries to Wikipedia/freeware), and mutual aid (including during crises: A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster). We can also add the greatest contributor to recovering the standard of living which capitalism derailed in “dark, Satanic mills”: public health interventions (esp. sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics, publicly-funded medical research). Public health and other social welfare programs are, in essence, new Commons to push back against colonization’s manufactured scarcity. For the significance of public health in context, see this passage (from Less is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World) as well as Perilous Passage: Mankind and the Global Ascendancy of CapitalWell, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?[Jonas Salk replying to question of who owns the new polio vaccine]…see comments below for rest of the review…","The Serviceberry by Robin Wall Kimmerer is a thought-provoking extended essay that explores the gift economy in the natural world. Using the example of a serviceberry tree, which forms a symbiotic relationship with birds, Kimmerer examines how we can foster sharing, generosity, and abundance in human communities. She highlights that, unlike market transactions, the gift economy operates without the expectation of direct compensation, relying instead on trust and mutual care.Kimmerer draws parallels to systems like public libraries, which thrive alongside market economies by offering communal benefits without profit motives. Through her reflections, she challenges readers to rethink consumption and encourages a more mindful approach to resources—urging us to ""harvest honorably"" with responsibility, restraint, respect, reverence, and reciprocity."
Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence,Anna Lembke,3.90,"This book is moralistic hogwash parading as science. Lembke repeatedly uses inappropriate data (Page 38: She quotes a ""famous seventeenth century physician"" who thinks pain and inflammation are part of the healing process. Guess what?: 21st century research has found the exact opposite to be true: Pain impedes healing, and inflammation IS disease); over generalizes anecdotes from her work with severely addicted individuals to the general population; and uses bogus statistics (She lists lots of increases in drug use as percentage rates without giving a baseline. An increase from zero to one is a 100% increase, but that doesn't make it a significant trend).While Lembke has had her own brush with a behavioral addiction, she apparently has never suffered from chronic pain or she would not be so cavalier about the suffering and debilitation it causes nor would she make claims about it being good for anybody.I'm done at page 66 where she states, ""Science teaches us that every pleasure exacts a price, and the pain that follows is longer lasting and more intense than the pleasure that gave rise to it."" Science teaches no such thing and that statement is hogwash. Even according to Lembke, this is only true of the long list of pleasures that have addicted her clients (or maybe just those pleasures she disapproves of), but it's not true of those that meet her approval, like watching a sunset or taking a walk. Yes, sunsets and walks are nice, healthy, life affirming activities, but so is a glass of wine over dinner with a friend and other moderate indulgences with potentially addictive pleasures by non addicts. Yet, according to Lembke, pleasure is dopamine is pleasure and it's all bad; it all leads to pain ... except maybe sometimes?","Moral puritanism disguised as science. The author uses her credentials to make it seem like she is coming from a rational, scientific point of view, and then uses the kind of anecdotes you see in tabloids to cause scare/terrify you. For example, she tells the story of a four year old sodomizing his little brother as an example of the impact of widely available pornography on our society—as if such a bizarre, singular event had any statistical significance, and wasn't just meant to terrify you.There is no other way for me to interpret her polemic on ""availability"" and touting the success of prohibition as tacit approval of the war on drugs. This is what happens you spend your whole life wielding a hammer. Your love of romance novels and sexy vampires looks like a nail. Having a beer or surfing reddit every day looks like a nail. Everything that brings you any amount of joy that isn't ""productive"" is on the same spectrum as being an opiate addict or hooking yourself up to a masturbation machine for hours a day. Sorry, ""the dark side of capitalism"" is not the fact that you can now buy really good weed without fear of jail time—It's that if you do anything other than work your job and raise your kids, you should feel bad about it.If you really enjoyed this book despite all that, I would highly encourage you to read Dr. Karl Hart's ""Drug Use For Grownups"" for a different perspective. I don't agree with everything in it either but I think it's a better bellwether for progress in the world of addiction medicine.","I have written nearly a thousand reviews on this site. The review that I wrote for this book has gotten hundreds more likes than any other, and it was the most negative one I ever wrote.

Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know,Adam M. Grant,4.13,"I will save you 6 hours of your time:Whatever you think you know, don't be afraid to re-think it.The end.","In 1933, the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that “the fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.” While this is just as true today as it was in the early twentieth-century, the problem actually runs deeper; almost everyone recognizes arrogance and overconfidence in others—but never in themselves.Since the time of Russell, what’s become known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect has been experimentally validated. Research shows—and personal experience confirms—that those who are the least knowledgeable in a subject tend to be the ones who overestimate their own knowledge and abilities, while those that are full of doubt know enough about the topic to better gauge the extent of their ignorance. And so the telltale sign of a lack of knowledge is, paradoxically, arrogance and overconfidence, whereas in those with actual expertise you often see the opposite: humility, doubt, and open-mindedness. Far more people fall on the side of overconfidence. This is due, at least in part, to widespread access to the internet, where people can quickly read articles and watch videos (of varying quality and credibility) on any conceivable topic, creating the impression that one has attained deep knowledge in a subject when only a very superficial understanding has been gained. Overcoming this unfortunate state of affairs is the subject of organizational psychologist Adam Grant’s latest book, Think Again, which seeks to show us how to overcome our own unjustified overconfidence by developing the habits of mind that force us to challenge our own beliefs and, when necessary, to change them. Grant begins by telling us that when we think and talk, we often slip into the mindset of three distinct professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. We become preachers when the unwarranted strength of our convictions compels us to convert others to our way of thinking; prosecutors when our sole aim is to discredit the beliefs of others; and politicians when we seek to win favors from our chosen constituency. What all of these mindsets have in common is the assumption that our beliefs are infallible, and that no one could possibly have anything to teach us. Trapped in the prison cell of our own dogma, we don’t set out to learn anything or update our own beliefs; our job is simply to convert others to our way of thinking because, of course, we are right. These habits of mental imprisonment can happen to anyone at any level of knowledge or experience, and intelligence itself has actually been shown at times to be a disadvantage, as those with high IQs have the most difficulty updating their beliefs. As Dunning himself said, “The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don’t know you’re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.” You may think all of your beliefs are correct (otherwise you wouldn’t hold them), but there is little doubt that at least some (probably many) of them are false or oversimplified. If your mind remains closed, you’ll never discover which of these beliefs require updating. The key question, then, is this: If most of us are unaware of the extent of our own ignorance, how can we hope to overcome our own resistance to change? The first step, as Grant recommends, is to detach your sense of self from any specific beliefs. If you identify with a specific set of fixed core beliefs, you will be far less likely to change your mind in the face of new evidence or better reasoning. Grant recommends instead to ground your sense of self in mental flexibility, taking pride in the fact that you’re willing to change your mind and update your beliefs. To achieve this, you must consider all of your beliefs to be provisional hypotheses and then seek to disprove them, in the process becoming more knowledgeable by being wrong more often. Using this approach, you will have discovered the ideal mindset for personal development and learning—not the mindset of a preacher, prosecutor, or politician, but the mindset of a scientist. The scientist, Grant tells us, has one overarching concern: the truth. The individual that adopts a scientific mindset will be equally motivated to challenge their own beliefs as the beliefs of others, testing hypotheses against the evidence and continually updating their beliefs in the process. Of course, as Grant points out, being an actual practicing scientist does not guarantee the adoption of this mindset. There are plenty of dogmatic scientists that don’t abide by the principles of their own training. The scientific mindset is not, as Grant is describing it, the mindset adopted by scientists necessarily, but rather the ideal mindset that follows the principles of science as an open-ended pursuit of knowledge that is constantly updated in the face of new evidence. In one interesting study described by Grant (the book is filled with fascinating examples and studies of a similar sort), two groups of entrepreneurs were provided training. One group was taught the principles of scientific thinking while the control group was not. The researchers found that the scientific-thinking group “brought in revenue twice as fast—and attracted customers sooner, too.” As Grant wrote:“The entrepreneurs in the control group tended to stay wedded to their original strategies and products. It was too easy to preach the virtues of their past decisions, prosecute the vices of alternative positions, and politick by catering to advisers who favored the existing direction. The entrepreneurs who had been taught to think like scientists, in contrast, pivoted more than twice as often.”Individuals that enjoy the prospect of being wrong—and so expand their knowledge more often—tend to be more successful and tend to hold more accurate, nuanced beliefs. It’s not that they lack confidence, it’s that their confidence is of a different nature. Flexible-minded individuals have confidence in their ability to learn and to unlearn beliefs that are outdated or are no longer serving them well. Their confidence lies in their ability to change and to adapt rather than in strength of their convictions concerning any single set of beliefs. As Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman put it, “Being wrong is the only way I feel sure I’ve learned anything.”There is definitely a line to walk, and the reader may wonder just how far they should take this advice. To constantly question every one of your beliefs would result in paralyzing doubt. Sometimes, it is the strength of our convictions that give us the energy and perseverance to pursue and accomplish our goals. So this is surely a balancing act, and while we all have to find the sweet spot between timidity and arrogance, conviction and doubt, there is little question that too many of us tend toward the extreme of overconfidence. After showing us how to become better rethinkers ourselves, in the second part of the book we learn how to open other people’s minds. Grant shows us how world-class debaters win debates, how a black musician talked white supremicists out of their bigoted views, and how doctors persuaded anti-vaxxers to get their children immunized. In every case, we learn the same lesson in the art of persuasion: to change someone else’s mind, you have to help them find their own internal motivation to change. This is not easy. The mindsets we typically slip into tend to have the opposite effect. Act as a preacher, and people will resist being told what to think (even if the facts are on your side). Act as a prosecutor, and people will resent your condescension and will become further entrenched in their original views. Act as a politician, and you’re just saying what you think people want to hear. None of these approaches are effective as tools of persuasion. It turns out that your best bet is to adopt, once again, the mindset of a scientist—and to try to get others to do the same. This will transform disagreements from battles to be won and lost into a collaborative pursuit of the truth. The most skilled negotiators, debaters, and persuaders all use similar tactics: they first find common ground and points of agreement, ask more questions to get the other person thinking deeper, present a limited number of stronger points, and introduce complexity into the topic to move the person’s thinking away from black-and-white and into shades of gray. It turns out that complexifying the issue is always key. Most people exhibit what psychologists call binary bias, or the “basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories.” If you can show people—through the use of skillful questioning—that the topic they think they understand deeply (Dunning-Kruger Effect) is actually far more complex than they originally thought with more than two distinct positions, then you can plant the seeds of doubt that eventually lead to real change. One example Grant uses is climate change. We tend to think that people fall into one of two categories—climate-deniers or alarmists—when in fact there are six distinct positions people can take from dismissive, doubtful, or disengaged to cautious, concerned, or alarmed—with shades of nuance in between. It’s often the recognition of this complexity that can get people talking and engaged in productive debate. In the final part of the book, Grant shows us how to use the skills of rethinking to engage in more productive political debates, to become better teachers, and to create more innovative cultures at work. Grant provides a host of compelling examples, but my favorite is the middle-school history teacher who gets her students to think like scientists by rewriting textbook chapters that failed to cover important historical events in sufficient depth. Her students pick a time period and topic that interests them and then, through independent research, rewrite the textbook chapter, in the process cultivating the skill to always question what they read. This is a far better approach than simply delivering a lecture and forcing students to regurgitate the information on a test. -----Bertrand Russell was once asked in an interview if he was willing to die for any of his beliefs. His response was this: “Of course not. After all, I may be wrong.” It’s a shame that most people adopt the opposite attitude, and Grant’s latest book will go a long way to remedying this. Think Again is a timely exploration of the importance of humility and the capacity to rethink your own positions while helping others do the same. But in the spirit of the book—and to “complexify” the topic—it’s worth considering when displaying doubt and humility might actually backfire. Grant wonders this himself, and points out, for example, that displays of doubt and humility have been shown to have negative effects in the workplace in those who have not already established their competence. It can also be less effective when delivering a presentation to an already sympathetic audience. Does Grant downplay the frequency of these types of situations? Another area where excessive doubt and humility might backfire is an area that Grant fails to consider in much depth at all: arguing with bad faith actors. When discussing politics, Grant seems to assume that in most cases both sides are equally motivated by the truth, and that each side has simply failed to understand the complexity of the topic or the merits of the other side. But we know that this is not always the case. In politics, people have a host of motives when arguing that sometimes have very little to do with the truth: the desire for power, money, influence, and sometimes simply the desire to offend and get a rise out of people. Grant does not cover how to handle these situations—or how to identify them—and it is highly unlikely that the tactics of the book will work in these situations. Additionally, it seems that the masses respond better to confidence when electing political representatives, because we know that Trump was not elected based on his knowledge or competence—and certainly not on his humility. When dealing with bad faith actors, perhaps a good strategy would be to start with a simple question, one Grant mentions in the book: “What evidence would change your mind?” If the answer is “nothing,” then it’s probably best to walk away. Either way, a chapter or section on bad faith actors and the questions you can ask to identify them would have been a welcome addition to the book. But of course, this book is not the final word on the topic, and Grant wouldn’t want it to be. As we gain better evidence and more experience, it’s our responsibility to continually rethink and update our beliefs. As Russell said, “If you’re certain of anything, you’re certainly wrong, because nothing deserves absolute certainty.”","Caveat: I'm probably not the target audience for this book. Saw 0 new arguments here, and also saw a lot of badly designed studies being masqueraded as ""data-driven proof"". Will not recommend – specially if you're an engineer, computer scientist or investor – and are in an environment where you're constantly seeking evidence that you're wrong and can do things betterRay Dalio's Principles is Taleb's Skin In the Game are far better books if you're looking to understand what it is that you do not knowThe first third of the book is about convincing the reader that being open to changing your mind is a good thing. The second third is about suggestions to get other people to change their mind. And the last third is about making societal level changes.The book has statements like “how many of us even admit being wrong, and seek disconfirming evidence” (most of us who do not come from privilege, and are constantly second guessing themselves hardly have this problem thank you very much). It also included some terribly designed studies which no one who uses modern apps and tools would take seriously. And some of it claims are just patently false (like ""no pollster had Trump as a frontrunner in the republican primary"" – Trump was literally the top contender in every single poll!)I can't wrap my head around how this is so highly rated. But to each their own, I guess"
Elon Musk,Walter Isaacson,4.35,"Walter Isaacson really is a fantastic biographer. It also helps that the material he is working with here is fascinating... there's no denying that Elon Musk has had a very interesting life and is himself quite unlike any other human. Though often not in a good way.We start this book in his childhood in South Africa and follow him through his difficulties with his father, his move to the United States, and several tumultuous businesses and relationships. He certainly did not have his wealth and success handed to him, but earned it through a combination of being brilliant and being an asshole. Isaacson is neither judgy, nor overly forgiving, and Elon Musk gets portrayed as the volatile idealogue he is. I do believe, after reading this book, that he is genuinely motivated by his own desire to better the planet and humanity, though his definition of bettering is suspect and he is not afraid to trample the little people to achieve his lofty goals. He's a genius, I guess. A savant. And a total dick. Thank goodness I can be fairly sure our paths will never cross.Edit: After reading some of the comments, I wanted to add one more thing. Despite what some people seem to have assumed, Isaacson is far from uncritical of Musk. This is not propaganda written by a fanboy; Isaacson portrays Musk as chaotic, mean, immature and obsessive. He documents his childish outbursts and what he calls his ""demon mode"". Having read Isaacson before, I didn't expect any less.","For a biography, this read like a series of vignettes written for Popular Mechanics and Vanity Fair at the same time, and submitted whilst the editor was taking a nap.Isaacson’s reputation as a biographer preceded him, I had seen an interview he gave where he talked about this book extolling how much he worked to present a fair and balanced narrative about the life of controversial entrepreneur Elon Musk, saying he’d followed him for two years and set up a hard condition that he’d have access to everything so he could tell all the good, the bad, and the ugly without Musk having a say in the final published product. It seemed refreshingly honest, conveying an image of a spunky writer looking for the truth and willing to get down and dirty to show the life of a world-changing billionaire as is, no sugarcoating and no punches pulled. We’d finally see the true Musk without the mask of public performance on, as he truly is in private. Who could resist that promise of unvarnished honesty?And instead, we got an author with a severe case of uncritical worshipping at the altar of Tech Bros, one of those techno-evangelicals that think technological advance will save humanity from ourselves and that don’t waste a chance to let us know it’s folks like Our Lord and Saviour Elon Musk, blessed be his cringey self, who take scientific progress by the throat and make it go forward kicking and screaming. They’re the saints of the Church of Innovation, who may be crazy, unethical, narcissistic, toxic arseholes, arrogant, selfish, abusive, mercurial, untrustworthy partners, horrible parents, and inveterate man-children with irreparably messed up personal lives, yes, but don’t you see The Innovations they bring about? So please forget the uncomfortable truths about them and please also forget the hard questions about ethics and morality in favour of focusing on The Innovations.Because it’s The Innovations that matter. Walter Isaacson circumvents asking the hard questions and doesn’t dare challenge Elon in the least when he does or says something questionable. He asks one question, Elon answers with something vague, grandiose, often bullshitty, or downright laughable, and Isaacson merely relays it, often very repetitively, and never goes beyond the occasional comment in passing that timorously will offer a possible different reality than what Elon has said. And he also uses euphemisms and softened synonyms to describe Elon’s erratic moods and behaviour, like when he repeatedly uses “reality-bending” or “reality-defying” to describe Elon’s claims and demands instead of the harsher but also more truthful “lies” and “unreasonable.” He never questions it when Elon cheaps out on materials or blatantly says regulations are for stupid people and only suggestions until proven otherwise, preferring instead to breathlessly talk about how much Elon saves on costs and how innovative his “thinking outside the box” in defying regulations and norms is. He never asks the questions he should about safety or the ethics of his ideas and experiments, let alone his companies’ practices. If you were hoping to see discussion of the realities of Tesla’s failures and Neuralink’s questionable ethics or Twitter’s changes since the disastrous takeover, you won’t find it here. Failures here are merely presented as obstacles that The Innovations’ favourite child-priest Elon will solve with his uncanny ability to see what nobody else does. When something goes wrong, like in the failed first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket, it’s going to be a poor hapless engineer’s fault for not doing this cog just like Elon said it should be, and never Elon’s fault. All credit to the boss, all the blame to the underlings, who, in the end, are the ones who do the hard work. Isaacson admits that Elon isn’t good at sharing power, but you won’t catch him admitting Elon isn’t good at sharing credit or giving others their due either. Long live the king, and if the kingdom goes to hell, the peasants are to blame, and please let’s not think too much of the aristocracy’s propensity to revolt against this particular king, shall we?Granted, it is one thing to be cautious toward the hand that is feeding you, and no matter what Isaacson wants to believe about his own supposed neutrality, Elon’s was the hand feeding him these two years. His objectivity was compromised, to say nothing of his neutrality. The billionaire is, by Isaacson’s own account, very persuasive and charismatic in his erratic way, and he lived with this man for two years. How can you even pretend to be objective in this scenario?But it’s another thing altogether to make excuses for Elon, and Isaacson does it here not just by omission. Whether deliberately or for lack of proper editing, the excuses made for Elon’s eyebrow-raising behaviour revolve around his claimed Asperger’s Syndrome. Is Elon emotionally abusive? Oh, ya see, he is autistic and can’t read the room. Is Elon an unreasonable arsehole that drives people sick with his gruelling work schedules and demands? Oh, ya see, he has Asperger’s and is “laser-focused” on the task. Is he a toxic drama llama that hurts his family and relationships? Oh, ya see, he has Asperger’s and his brain isn’t wired for empathy. Has Elon got himself ousted by his own partners and is hated by employees? Oh, ya see, he has Asperger’s and has no social and teamwork skills. Does Elon have a ridiculous talent for sticking his dick in crazy? Oh, ya see, he is “a fool for love” and also has Asperger’s. Has Elon stubbed his toe on a Tesla’s tire that day and now can't walk with a big sore toe? Oh, ya see, he has Asperger’s . . .And the thing is, we don’t know he has Asperger’s or not, and neither does Elon. He was never diagnosed by a professional. It’s a self-diagnosis. And you know what’s worse? That everyone, Isaacson included, just took that self-diagnosis as gospel and repeats it to explain and justify everything insane, toxic, borderline illegal, and unreasonable Elon does. The amount of Elon acolytes that mindlessly say he has Asperger’s as if he’s been diagnosed by the best professional in the world and can’t be doubted is disturbing. Only Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, is the one that says here it is merely a self-diagnosis, and Isaacson dutifully notes it down and relays it in her words, to quickly forget it and repeat the Elonite crowd’s collective excusatory bleat that Elon is an Aspie and that explains his Elon-ness. Is this an attempt to deflect criticism by claiming a disability? If Elon is truly autistic (one of his sons is, so it’s not that improbable that he might be as well), then criticism of him carries the taint of ableism. And to be honest, I don’t get the impression that they use his supposed Asperger’s for anything but excusing him. Asperger’s for Elon has become a mantle of self-justification that his employees and friends have picked up without a second thought.But, there’s another problem with this: Elon hasn’t stopped the self-diagnosis at autism. He has also self-diagnosed as Bipolar. He claimed he was Bipolar to explain what he describes as his most hellish year, 2018, when his love life was a poisonous brew of mutual abuse with Amber Heard and Tesla and SpaceX were having serious problems. This pattern says he’s prone to self-diagnosing without a basis, just grabs what looks plausible and claims it for himself. I’ve seen some charitable souls trying to defend him saying maybe Elon did go to therapy incognito and never told. Ha! I’m sorry, but no. Elon very explicitly rejected going to psychotherapy when his concerned friend told him to, and when his first wife wanted him to go to couples therapy, he bailed out immediately. He has been asked to go to therapy when he was in hell in 2018 again, and he didn’t want to go. This isn’t a man who admits to having mental health issues to take care of them but one that is happy to claim mental health issues when it suits him. He’s like that kind of idle old lady that reads a book or magazine article about mental health issues and suddenly decides this is what she has and tells all and sundry about her poor, poor mental health self-diagnosis to get pity and validation and excuse her own shittiness. We all have known this type of self-diagnosed hypochondriacs at some point, so why is Elon given a pass with his made up self-diagnoses? Why does Isaacson not challenge him on this? These fake sufferers are a bad reflection on legitimate mental health sufferers, and Isaacson acts as an enabler here.I don’t think Isaacson even wanted to write a biography as much as to write about the tech advances Elon’s companies pioneered. He’s not a good biographer at all, when you look closer. He doesn’t know how to handle the personal life of his subject, and it’s all the more noticeable when Elon’s early life is dealt with quickly and perfunctorily by 22% of the book, meaning that over two thirds of this book are about Elon’s companies, which is what Isaacson truly admires and wants to write about. For all that Elon’s supposed hard childhood in South Africa and the environment of violence he grew up in are used as explanations for why he’s a relentless fighter that doesn’t know the meaning of “no” and “risky,” this period of his life is hardly given a few chapters and the instances that supposedly were character-shaping for Elon aren’t analysed or even described at large. It’s terribly superficial, and I didn’t get the impression that Elon’s childhood was particularly hard at all. Oh, sure, he and his siblings keep saying it was and can’t shut up about what a bad man, very bad their father is, but when you want to know precise examples of why it was so hard, you are given examples like the bullying at school (that Elon seems to have provoked by calling the other boy names) and the “veldskool” camp that sounds like a rougher-sounding Boy Scouts with more violence than would be acceptable in the US. Is that the “hard childhood” he claims to have had? It seems more like bad and violent incidents than regular occurrences. To me, it sounds like he had a regular childhood with bad times here and there mostly as a result of toxic masculinity than deprivation or abusiveness like you usually think of when you’re told someone has had a hard childhood. His father, however, was truly a piece of work, and Elon is more alike to him than anyone in his circle wants to admit.The bits of adult Elon's life are also so very superficial and barely mentioned in passing in short paragraphs. The author doesn't seem to even want to discuss the comical evolution by Elon from bro! to bruh . . . much, because he doesn't delve into his progression from liberal techie that got his behind kissed by Obama to conservative hat-wearing cows-less faux Texas cowboy that's racked in a fanbase of Republicans that'd make Donald weep with envy. Just as he avoids the hard questions about his early life and his companies, Isaacson also doesn't like to give Elon's politics and ideological swings more onpage time than he can help.Perhaps Isaacson should’ve stuck to writing about the tech companies and their innovations and not attempted a biography for which he’s clearly not prepared. Or willing. But even the overwhelming number of tech chapters (this book has 95 chapters and most of them about Musk’s tech dealings) isn’t done well. I already mentioned the issues with acting as a mere relayer of information that circumvents questioning, ethics, morality of tech practices, and so on, but an additional problem is the deficient editing. Seriously, where was the editor? This book is repetitive, isaacson uses the same phrases over and over, and sometimes even goes about the same thing in different chapters. That’s why I said it’s written like vignettes, all put together on the run, a collection of notes put together more or less coherently, and submitted for publication with . . . uh, I hesitate to say there was editing, because it doesn’t seem to me like there was any. And if there was, it is so poor it’s no wonder this book turned out to be a 700-page bloat.There’s not much we can find new in those chapters either. At least, not if you don’t live under a rock and do read the news. There’s some new information here and there, mostly not quite relevant in the grand scheme of things as it pertains mostly to Elon’s private life, which is ultimately his to live as he pleases. But there is one bomb dropped here that is relevant: the revelation that Elon meddled in Ukraine’s defence strategy by turning off Starlink at a key point when they were going to attack the Russian fleet at Sevastopol in Crimea. Elon dropped this bomb on Isaacson by text, and Isaacson duly relayed it with zero criticism, not even a word of concern on the worrying fact that Elon had taken this decision after he was talked by the Russian ambassador into believing that this would escalate the war so much nukes would become a reality, and that after turning Starlink off on the Ukrainians, Elon again made sure to tell the Russian ambassador that he’d done this and that Starlink would not be used for military purposes. Isaacson knew this for a year, sat on it, and then relayed it in his book with no comment, no criticism, no nothing. That alone would make me question his integrity, if there was nothing else. Sadly, the only time I can tell that Isaacson does question Musk’s official line is when he asked Elon about his motives for buying Twitter. True to his grandiose sense of messianic mission in life, Elon babbled a speech about truth, freedom, justice, reasonably-priced blue checks and a hard-boiled twittering bird’s egg, but this time at least Isaacson didn’t just let him talk, he managed to insert his own suspicion that the true motivations might also be as much fun as the desire to own the playground because as an awkward nerd with zero social skills and a shitty personality, he yearns to have the playground where the awkward nerds with zero social skills and shitty personalities can and do shine.Is Elon a free speech champion as he claims? Mmm, let me copy Isaacson’s method for a bit and relay to you an incident between him and Bezos (bold is mine):They met in 2004 when Bezos accepted Musk’s invitation to take a tour of SpaceX. Afterward, he was surprised to get a somewhat curt email from Musk expressing annoyance that Bezos had not reciprocated by inviting him to Seattle to see Blue Origin’s factory, so Bezos promptly did. Musk flew up with Justine, toured Blue Origin, then they had dinner with Bezos and his wife MacKenzie. Musk was filled with advice, expressed with his usual intensity. He warned Bezos that he was heading down the wrong path with one idea: “Dude, we tried that and that turned out to be really dumb, so I’m telling you don’t do the dumb thing we did.” Bezos recalls feeling that Musk was a bit too sure of himself, given that he had not yet successfully launched a rocket. The following year, Musk asked Bezos to have Amazon do a review of Justine’s new book, an urban horror thriller about demon-human hybrids. Bezos explained that he did not tell Amazon what to review, but said that he would personally post a customer review. Musk sent back a brusque reply, but Bezos posted a nice personal review anyway.There it is. Goodreads users and other frequent readers and reviewers, how do you feel now knowing free speech champion Elon Musk stoops to gaming the system to promote content he wants popularised for his personal or his dependents' gain? He asked Bezos to order Amazon do reviews of his wifey’s book, so what’s to stop him now that he owns Twitter from doing this very thing with content there he wants promoted and made popular? People who want to game ratings through reviews to favour the book of the woman they’re sleeping with will also promote only content they agree with or that their circle/family/paying customers want seen.I, personally, feel disgusted. If I loathe the ‘likes’-harvesters and book influencers that will do anything, even unethical stuff, for visibility for their reviews, why would I think differently of a man with the power to decide what is and isn’t relevant online?By now, you’ll probably be wondering if this is a hagiography or merely a poorly edited and poorly laid out bonafide biography, and I’d say it’s both. You’d have, to use Isaacson’s much-favoured expression, to use reality-defying logic to do an obvious and open hagiography of someone like Elon given what he is like and the life he leads and the companies he runs, but it can be done low-key by omission and by justification, which is how it was done for this book. A better editor would’ve done much for the book’s presentation and layout as well, so it at least would’ve been a readable and entertaining biography. You don’t have to like the subject of a biography to like the biography itself, I didn’t come to this book as an Elon hater, I was very willing to read it out of curiosity and desire to learn more, so I expected something worth this author’s reputation. Yet I came out of reading this with a poor image of both subject and author. That the last paragraph is a risibly fanboyish “Sure, he’s crazy and toxic and cringey and a man-child, but . . . lookie there! Innovations!” just cinched it for me.","I am the translator of the Chinese edition of this book, and it is expected to be published simultaneously with the English edition. I am fortunate to have finished reading this work before 99.9999% of readers worldwide. I must say that this book is very thorough in its investigation, follow-up interviews, and information comparison, regarding a contemporary technology entrepreneur. Its depth of interviews is unparalleled in most successful entrepreneur biographies. Walter shadowed Elon for a staggering two years, interviewing not only Elon's mother, brother, colleagues, and friends who supported him, but also his father, ex-wife, ex-girlfriend, ex-colleagues, and former business partners who had conflicts, friction, arguments, disputes, and even coups with him. These individuals also agreed to be interviewed by Walter, and the total number of named interviewees reached 126. This is rare even in a single entrepreneur biography. Therefore, what you are about to read is not merely flattering words about Elon, but a more complete and objective account of significant events based on the collision of information from multiple sources. Moreover, Walter claims that Elon did not interfere with the creation of this book.I believe this is the work that Walter has put the most effort into, possibly even more than his previous book, Steve Jobs. It may also be one of the most important biographies in the Chinese and English publishing world in the years around 2023.-----------------------Updated Sep 12th, 2023.5 Questions You might want to know about this Musk’s 688-page new biographyQ: How does this Elon Musk compare to the previous Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future?A: Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future was published in 2015 and covers events up to 2014.This Elon Musk was published in 2023 and covers events up to April 2023.As it's widely known, the past ten years have been incredibly significant for Elon Musk's business, with many remarkable stories unfolding during this decade. Let me give you an example. After Steve Jobs passed away, there were rumors that the most likely person to succeed him was Jony Ive, who was the Chief Design Officer at Apple and shared similar design philosophies with Jobs.Similarly, at Tesla, there's someone who shares Elon Musk's vision, and his name is Franz von Holzhausen. He's the Chief Designer, and most of Tesla's design work happens under his leadership. So, if you find Tesla's industrial design appealing, don't forget this name.In Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, this important figure appears for the first time after 75% of the book; while in Elon Musk, he first appears at the 30% mark of the book. So, you can imagine how much more of the story about him and Musk working together to create Tesla products (including Cybertruck and autopilot system) is in the new book.The early appearance of characters doesn't necessarily mean that the earlier content is superficial, or that Isaacson didn't delve deeply into Musk's early history. In fact, for writing this book, Isaacson interviewed many people, including Musk's former partners who orchestrated an internal coup at PayPal to oust him, as well as his fierce rivals at Tesla, ex-wives and girlfriends he had disputes with. This also includes Jeff Bezos, who competed fiercely with him in the aerospace industry, and Bill Gates, whom he vehemently criticized (Isaacson interviewed two former richest man to write about this richest man... quite impressive).Previously, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future probably had only a few dozen hours of interviews with Musk himself, although it also interviewed people around him. In contrast, Isaacson shadowed Musk for 2 years, so there's no need to ask about interview duration and frequency. The follow-up interviews mainly took place from 2021 to 2023, up until the final chapter that covers the Starship launch test site, and beyond that, it doesn't touch on recent events like the showdown with Mark Zuckerberg.Isaacson, to write about one person, managed to interview 126 people. As someone who also writes books, I'm quite envious of Isaacson's firsthand resources.Q: Which chapters of the book are particularly exciting? A: Personally, I find the chapters detailing the “surge” of Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity to be the most exciting. As someone who is interested in the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing industries, I think Elon Musk's ability to drive cost reduction and efficiency improvement is astonishing. There's hardly another entrepreneur like him anywhere in the world.Elon's experiences during several critical and challenging periods, such as those in 2008 and 2017, are also quite relatable and gripping.Additionally, the chapter about Ukraine is particularly astonishing. Just a few days ago, it made headlines in the news carried spoilers from the book. The insider information provided in the book is exclusive and incredibly detailed. We owe Musk a debt of gratitude for helping us avoid a crisis that could have escalated into a major conflict between Russia and Ukraine (a super war), thanks to his timely and correct decisions. Lastly, for those interested in the Twitter acquisition process, it occupies a significant portion of the final 1/4 of the book. The entire event unfolds in a rather chaotic manner (What a mess!), but Isaacson's narrative clears up the confusion and provides a well-organized account.Q: What are the limitations of this book?A: The limitations of the book lie in the fact that you have to rely on your imagination for certain aspects. For example, you'll have to imagine what Elon Musk's father was like or how much his siblings resemble him; these details might be more visually apparent in photos or videos.I would recommend that everyone watch the documentary series, The Elon Musk Show in 2022. The content of the documentary closely mirrors the content of this book.There's an old saying in English: ""In me the tiger sniffs the rose."" The book primarily presents his ""tiger"" side as he conducts his business activities, while the documentary, through the narration of his former wife Talulah Riley, showcases his ""tender"" side.Readers may have a similar experience while reading the book.Q: What are the differences between Elon Musk and American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer?A: That’s an odd question. Considering the close proximity of Nolan's new movie release and the publication of Musk's book, both of which are biographies of prominent figures, we may take this opportunity to compare the writing styles of different authors.Everyone would agree that Nolan is a master of manipulating the timeline of a story. American Prometheus is very much in line with his style of directing. Although the English version is over 700 pages, a little bit thicker than the Musk’s biography, there aren't many long, continuous narratives. Instead, it consists of many fragments interwoven together.However, one complaint I have is that reading American Prometheus is a much more mentally taxing task than watching the 3-hour movie about Oppenheimer. It's not just because reading a book takes longer than watching a movie, but because the author has provided detailed descriptions of the lives and events of dozens or even hundreds of minor characters like Chevalier, Tatlock, Strauss, etc. When you first read it, you can get lost in the maze of these side stories and struggle to identify which biographical details of these characters are important for understanding Oppenheimer’s life.Nolan filtered out those things, leaving behind their important intersecting stories, or story fragments strongly connected with Oppenheimer, and cleverly interwine them into a more complete biographical film. If you watch the movie first and then try to find a plot in the book, you'll discover that Nolan has essentially exhausted many of the plot fragments from the book, leaving no additional descriptions.But Isaacson's Elon Musk is not like this. His descriptions of many story segments are more complete. If a director wants to adapt the biography into a movie in the future, they can almost take shortcuts because many scenes, details, and dialogues can be directly used to create complete story segments. This is thanks to Isaacson's extensive firsthand information resources. I can't help but speculate that, based on the storylines he has revealed, if he were to dig into his database and archives and write an 800-page or 1000-page biography still consistently focused on Musk without any digressions, it wouldn't be too difficult.Isaacson's introduction of all the minor characters (supporting roles), I believe, is just right. He only introduces the stories that can help us understand Elon Musk. Even though there are hundreds of characters in the book, you won't be confused by these names. To put it bluntly, Isaacson is acutely aware in his writing: they are all ""tools"" to help us understand Elon.Q: What is the underlying theme of this book?A: The underlying theme of this book is that Elon Musk is a great boss but not necessarily a good person – still a little bit different from the theme of Steve Jobs.The definition of a great boss is someone who can lead a team to achieve exceptional goals and create significant societal value, regardless of the means used to achieve those goals.The essential characteristic of a good person is having empathy at or above the average level of ordinary people.Can we expect someone with such remarkable business achievements to also be a universally likable and compassionate individual in their interactions with family, friends, and colleagues? Isaacson tends to believe it's not possible, and I share the same view.A person's character is a holistic entity, and the aspects of their personality that surface in different social relationships are facets of that whole. We cannot demand that the parts of a person that make them unlikable in their personal life (such as their coldness, ruthlessness, or devilish traits) be completely ""formatted"" while retaining the aspects that dazzle us, like their impressive business accomplishments. This is something that cannot be achieved.The above perspective provides a key to understanding Elon Musk as an individual and comprehending the essence of this book."
Playground,Richard Powers,4.20,"This novel totally shows off Richard Powers’s signature style - mixing deep emotional moments with sharp takes on current events and a really cool look at how humans and nature connect. Honestly, it deserves a spot on the shortlist for the 2024 Booker Prize.At its core, the book is all about protecting the environment, with a big focus on the ocean. But unlike his earlier works, which were all about the battle between destruction and preservation, Playground follows Evie, a marine scientist, as she endlessly explores the ocean and marvels at its wonders. Powers paints the underwater world so beautifully - every creature comes off as innocent, charming, and mysteriously wise. Once you’ve seen the magic of the deep, it’s hard to forget.Then there’s Todd, another main character who dives into today’s hot topics like AI and social networks. His story - and his connection with Rafi - brings out a bittersweet vibe about loneliness, friendship, and where things ultimately lead. Todd’s crew of tech geniuses have whipped up AI and social platforms that seem to have taken on a life of their own, maybe even in a bid to create a never-ending, perfect game.The book’s “playground” is this multi-layered world: Todd’s social platform, the ocean seen through Evie’s eyes with its countless swimming creatures, the evolving friendship between Todd and Rafi, and even Ina’s artistic universe. But bit by bit, everything starts to fall apart. The ocean suffers from human actions taken in the name of progress, and though we don’t know exactly what price we’ll pay, it’s clear that true harmony between humans and nature is slipping away. That leads to a radical new path, one where AI starts pushing boundaries. Still, the roles of who’s in control and who isn’t remain up in the air.Powers’a storytelling pulls you right into these heavy themes. With multiple narrative perspectives bouncing between different times and places, you quickly get a feel for each character and their intertwined stories. After just a few chapters, you’re pretty confident you’ve got the plot figured out.But then, I was totally caught off guard. I’d assumed the “I” narration was just talking to us, the readers, and that the third-person sections were simply there to tell different characters’ stories. So when an important twist hit in the second-to-last chapter, I was nearly floored. Turns out, Powers had set up this entire playground where readers are actually cast as a super-evolved, all-knowing AI—one that’s picked up on every story and has the power to rebuild a world where the lost can come back. All those third-person bits? They were stories the AI was feeding Todd, drawing him into a new game of reunions and farewells. Everything is reset in an instant, and it’s never too late to change course. It’s a brilliant twist that pulls you deep into this ocean of fiction, stirring up both sadness and awe. At that moment, Powers nails it - showing off the wild possibilities and potential terrors of AI. Whether it’s a trick or a miracle, it all depends on how you look at it.A fun little detail is in the dedication where Powers writes to Rayray: “750,000 thanks to you, better yet, let's make it a million.” I was stumped until I noticed those same numbers popping up throughout the book.Yeah, that’s the playground.4.6 / 5 stars","This may be one of my favorite books ever. It certainly is my favorite of Richard Powers so far--and I am a big fan of Powers. I loved The Overstory. Powers manages to do so much in a single work--more than seems possible--and Playground shows just how much he can do. He juggles multiples story lines and seemingly divergent themes--managing to pull them together in a grand finale that is like the thundering yet melodic conclusion to a great symphony.On one level, the story revolves a set of characters. Todd Keane and Rafi Young meet as young teens. On the surface, the two boys seem quite different. Keane is the son of a successful businessman, securely white and privileged while Rafi comes from an obviously dysfunctional home in an impoverished community. As poor and an African American, Rafi is at an obvious disadvantage at his elite school, while Todd seamlessly belongs. But both boys comes from pain-filled (and pain-inflicting) families, each dysfunctional in its own way and equally incapable of nurturing their children. Rafi seeks refuge in literature. Todd, who as a young boy dreamed of being an oceanographer, is drawn to technology. After experiencing a tragedy, he gives himself entirely to coding and exploring the newly emerging technology that becomes the Internet.And always throughout the book there is the theme and activity of game playing. As well as that of ecology, seen through the lens of the ocean and the overwhelming multiplicity of life it contains.As Rafi and Todd abandon chess for the more intensely challenging game of Go, Evie Bourlieu is submerged into a water tank by her father to test out a new apparatus for breathing underwater. This experiment is the catalyst for Evie for a lifetime devoted to submerging herself in the depths of the ocean.Somewhere in an island in the Pacific ocean, the inhabitants are trying to recover from an exploitation of their land by Europeans that first enriched and then devastated them. Now the western world is back with a new offer.The title of this book resonates throughout this book in many levels, many tones, many different keys. Sometimes completely unexpectedly I would realize that I was witnessing yet another echo, another game, another form of play.Play that is absorbing, exciting, freeing. And sometimes--maybe ultimately and inevitably--lethal.I was left breathless at the beauty of Powers' descriptions of ocean life, full of poetic lists that overwhelmed--only to leave the reader that much more grief-stricken by how much death we have caused, what desolation we have wreaked.I found The Overstory exciting and fascinating but Playground moved me to tears (not usual for me when reading). This is Powers at his most passionate. And the balance between the personal--the friendships, the ways in which we love, and help, and hurt each other--and the more abstract themes which become personalized, particularly through Evie but through the people on the island as well--is delicate and beautiful.I love books that push me to think as well as enable me to feel.","It didn’t take a supercomputer to figure out we’d get another remarkable novel about artificial intelligence from Richard Powers.In 1995, Powers published “Galatea 2.2,” his Pygmalion tale about training a neural network called Helen to take a graduate exam on Western literature. At one point in that haunting story, after Helen has finished “reading” fiction and poetry, she’s given a CD-ROM containing recent news, human rights reports, political exposés and police bulletins. Overwhelmed by the horrors of human behavior, Helen announces, “I don’t want to play anymore.”Well, almost three decades later — a millennium in computer time — Helen’s got her mojo back. Powers’s new novel, “Playground,” leaps across the circuits that enable large language models and delivers a mind-blowing reflection on what it means to live on a dying planet reconceived by artificial intelligence. The book won’t be officially released until Sept. 24, but it’s already been named a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and longlisted for the Booker Prize.Although “Playground” is nowhere near as mammoth as the author’s Pulitzer-winning opus, “The Overstory,” it follows a similarly fragmented structure. But trust me, any disorientation will eventually melt into wonderment.The main narrator, Todd Keane, was once “a soldier for the digital revolution” and is now its king. He’s a world-famous tech genius who created an app called Playground. Part Facebook, part Reddit, Playground has hooked billions of daily users by gamifying engagement in a self-contained economy that runs on Playbucks. Closely shadowing the influence of social media, Playground affords Powers the opportunity to satirize and mourn the platforms that have colonized our lives.When we meet Todd, he’s been diagnosed with. . .

Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,James Nestor,4.15,"Over-promising, potentially dangerous, pseudo-science book that uses limited to no data to substantiate its claims. We don’t need another rebuke of science in the world these days...Nestor’s sentences like “doctors use scary words to describe breathing like hypercapnia, hypoxia...” undermine actual researchers and physicians. This book uses the classic trope of the medical establishment dismissing obvious, home-remedy style solutions. Friend, if even 10% of the claims in this book were true, physicians everywhere would be prescribing breathing exercises immediately. What are those claims? The author states that breathing can cure scoliosis, strokes, asthma, bacteremia caused by injecting E. Coli into a patients veins, etc. Nearly every disease category is invoked. Only in his final disclaimers at the end of the book does he say “if you have stage 4 cancer, these breathing exercises won’t cure that.”This feels like a Theranos-style use of data. The author uses Stanford’s name like he’s a full professor there, but he’s not affiliated at all and merely participated in a study on nose-breathing vs mouth-breathing. He uses qualifiers like “in several unpublished studies”...readers should beware of claims like that. Why would something so effective be unpublished? Oh right, the medical establishment trope. He interviews several “pulmonauts” — a word he created that is an insult to astronauts everywhere. These are people who have tried weird things with breathing and believe they’re effective. One main thesis is the equivalent of intermittent fasting for breathing...”what if we breathed less?” Look out for future books on things-we-all-do mixed with what-if-we-did-them-less. Book ideas: blinking? itching? moving? Have at it, Mr. Nestor. Can breathing help calm us down? Probably. Do people have actual breathing problems? Of course. Are we all breathing wrong and nearly all our ailments can be cured by just following this author’s breathing exercises? Doubtful. If all this is true, put in the effort and run some scientific studies, Mr. Nestor. Prove your claims, get them peer-reviewed, and show the world. It’s too easy to write a misleading book these days. How is this a NYTimes bestseller? Perhaps it should be in the fiction category...","In terms of single subject science books, Breath is a bit light on the science and heavy on the anecdotal evidence. Though there doesn’t appear to be anything outrageous or obviously harmful here, there also doesn’t appear to be deeply researched double-blind scientific studies following statistically significant populations either. The observation of one yogi who can seemingly control body temperature doesn’t make much of an observation about humanity at large, and it might just be an aberration or a falsified data point. But again, the recommendations of nose breathing and engaging in yoga-style breathing exercises seem fairly benign and may even improve overall health. But the science seems about as settled as various diet recommendations, the science of which seems to change by the year.","One GR reviewer calls this ""4 parts good info and 1 part crackpot,"" which I think is fair. Maybe even a little too kind -- I'd call it 3 parts good info, 1 part chat & anecdotes, and 1 part crackpot. It drove me nuts that there were no footnotes, and the bibliography isn't in the book but on his website. On his website. Grrrrrrr.But that doesn't change the fact that for me, this was exactly the right book at exactly the right time. A few days ago I noticed that my breathing pattern was short and shallow and fast and uncomfortable, and I couldn't seem to shift it. It was as if my upper torso was locked, and I couldn't extend my inhales or exhales. It was a strange and disconcerting experience. This library loan came through that same day, and along with a breathing app I'd had on my phone forever, I set to work/play to try to loosen things up.The resulting changes in my body came so swiftly that I decided I'd better keep a daily log to track them. Otherwise, I knew I'd be looking back on this experience and doubting things could have happened that... dramatically.Starting with the day I opened the book and began experimenting with its techniques, I've had 4 consecutive nights of good sleep. Four nights. It has been years since I could say that. YEARS. The chronic sinus/nasal congestion that's been a feature of my life forever has moderated by about 50%. And my posture problem, that over the years I've alternately bemoaned and physically struggled against? That resolved itself in 18 hours (half of which I spent asleep).And it's not like I haven't experimented with breathwork before. I've even done Grof's Holotropic Breathwork, many years ago (which I'd actually forgotten about entirely, until I encountered it in this book -- that's how little impact it had on me). But like I said above, right book, right time.My experience is just another anecdote, though, so take it for whatever it's worth. Be aware that there's some very fair criticism of the book out there. For example, here's a 3-star review I agree with: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And here's a 1-star review with a perspective worth considering: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...But for me personally, implementing the breathing advice in this book has been, and is currently in the process of being, transformative. And when the price drops a bit, I'll buy a copy to keep. (I add that last sentence for the benefit of my GR friends who know what a cheapskate I am.)"
"Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 1 - The Birth of Humankind","David Vandermeulen (Adapter), Yuval Noah Harari, Daniel Casanave (Illustrator)",4.36,"I read Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari.Now there is a full-color illustrated book version that is simple and easy to understand.Attract more people to read, especially young people and children.I like this book.Waiting for volume 2, 3...","I think many of us are familiar with the best selling nonfiction title, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by the same author, and this is its graphic novel counterpart. I have not read the former and really enjoyed my time with the latter. The illustrations are detailed, beautifully colored, informative, and add to the experience. Anthropology was one of my majors in undergrad, and I loved revisiting those topics and also the newer research that’s been discovered/uncovered since I last studied. I think the graphic novel is a great crossover for both adults and younger readers in learning about a most fascinating topic. I received a gifted copy. Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader","One of my favourite books of all time, in graphic novel form, works incredibly well. This is only the first volume, its quite a sizeable book even at 250 pages but is a quick and enjoyable read.Often humorous, it is a great look into the history of humankind (as its predecessor was). Just with, of course, a lot more lively and vibrant illustrations. This is possibly the most entertaining way to learn about history, even for somebody who may have not been interested enough to pick up the original book or was intimidated by its length. This would make an ideal starting point for the younger generation to learn about the history of humanity too. The first part depicts Yuval himself educating his young niece Zoe by taking her to meet biologist Professor Saraswati. There are a whole host of characters who take us through various parts of the beginning of human history, such as Prehistoric Bill. Very excited for Volume 2! And I hope “Homo Deus” - Harari’s second book about the future of humanity - is also put into the graphic novel format in the near future."
"What Happened To You?: Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing","Bruce D. Perry, Oprah Winfrey",4.43,"Possibly one of the best DIY self help, brain fix, auto mind penetration for better, more massive mental reconstruction, books ever written Combining the scientific with the personal emotional to better understand the reasonsOther authors might have just focused on the theoretical, neurochemical, brain architecture, epigenetic traits, etc. way, the just psychiatric psychological foundations, or on personal, emotional examples, but by combining the science and knowledge offered by Perry with the wisdom and real life experiences of Oprah, the book reaches new levels of accessibility to help readers find out how broken they really are. And accepting and understanding what caused years and decades of self doubt, fragility, and mental problems is the key to the solution in the form of a fresh, better, and more stable self. The medical, neurological part of PTSD and trauma manifested and shown with real life examples that might be disturbing and too much for some readersThe above mentioned balance stays perfect throughout the whole book, Perry delivers the understandable, broken down science which is spiced and exponentiated by Opray, who is not getting weaker by opening herself up to what happened to her, but stronger by accepting, forgiving, and thereby creating a positive, better, and healthier self. That´s another key element, not believing that one is this body, emotion, diagnosis, or mind, but that´s it´s just the current, changeable state one can form to whatever kingdom or hell one wants to live in. Including another extremely challenging part, not forgiving, but accepting the perpetrators and the impact they had without triggering flashbacks. The baby makes the child makes the teen makes the adult brain and identity.Understanding that one can get out of her/his skin, break the doom loop, escape the self made mental torture chamber, can just be achieved by reflecting on how the present state of mind has been reached, what made one the person one is. Desillusion of self and ego, something close to enlightenment, might be an a bit too big, unrealistic option for beginners, but the central, most important key element on the way is the same. Accepting that one doesn´t have to be the person, described by adjectives, mindsets, or mainstream psychological traits, one was made and used to be, because change is possible. And just that milestone leads to Healing and an end of sufferingJust by understanding and realizing how miserable one really is, the step towards finally growing scars, on wounds festering for years, can be done. Gratitude, exercise, mindfulness, meditation, Buddhism, perseverance, and discipline are necessary to reach this extremely tricky goal. Social nets and family can help, but the most essential part is to transform and metamorphize from helpless victim or mentally sick and unstable patient who suffers, takes pills, goes to therapy for years, and never dares to dig down to the core of the problems and confront oneself with them, to someone developing auto self repair functions and resilience. Don´t fight or flight, meditate and find inner peaceThe key problem, I found in close to all similar works, is to never understand that an untrained monkey mind is an accelerating self destruction train that is getting more and more momentum by changing neural passways, by deepening all problems by conditioning the personality to more fear, fright, avoiding behavior, and mental problems. While awake, the demons, memories, and injuries keep popping up as they wish to, old associations are mixed with the current life and one doesn´t even want to know what happens while sleeping. Of course, perfected mind control and years of practice are a damned hard challenge, but without that tricky psychological workout, one ends with a different, weaker, far less armored, and save brain and mind.  Personal drivelWhat motivates me to reach these therapy, Buddhism, meditation nonfiction works is mostly an egoistic wish to pimp my mind to perfection, because I have the extreme luck of not having real traumatic problems, just the usual WEIRD first world problems with childhood, parents, family, the usual ridiculous stuff when compared to people who suffered real, long time mental, physical, and sexual abuse. Those might find one of the most successful ways to deal with their issues, to find a better way back to a normal life. Because the more I understand how severely my minor mini traumas influence who I was, am, and will be, the more respect I have for people who find ways out of the abysses of things done to them, so terrible that close to all average people wouldn´t find a way back out of the screaming nightmares haunting them.Other great, similar books that are dealing with improving ones´ psychic bodys´ defences:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...More to find in my 0 mental strength shelve.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditationhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogen...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful...","This was such a much needed read. I’ve always been of the opinion that your beginnings, your childhood, your what-happened-to-you moments shape your being. Your past shapes your present, your wounds can translate into something you don’t even recognise started with some form of trauma.The audiobook was great. It felt like I was listening to a podcast. There are case studies presented alongside the science of the mind and how the two intertwine. The science never felt too much. It was easy enough to follow and understand. This allowed me to reflect a lot. Truth be told, it’s something I’m always thinking about. Healing from trauma is a lifelong journey and I think my biggest takeaway from this book is that it’s never too late, it’s definitely possible and the brain is malleable. It allows you to look at your difficulties, your circumstance with grace and compassion, as well as those of others. And that your chances of healing are better with a loving support system. Whether that it is with your own family or your own found family.A random tidbit: annoying to know that us weak humans are social creatures and need people/community to really survive and have a healthy mental well-being. That’s my plan to live like a hermit out the window.","Audiobook… read by Bruce D. Perry and Oprah Winfrey …..8 hours and 27 minutes“Biologically speaking….continuous trauma can weaken remaining neutral pathways to the thinking part of the brain and strengthen neutral pathways to the survival part, thus bypassing the thinking part, which makes some children less capable of coping with adversity as they grow up”.

The Mercy of Gods,James S.A. Corey,4.18,"Everything about this book is incredible. I loved everything about it. It's a very smart, original and gripping tale, full of unique and touching characters and the writing is absolutely fantastic. Every page was perfect, and I can't wait for the rest of the series.I never read The Expanse, I just watched the show, so I can't compare and I went in without any real expectations, mostly because of the blurb. I'm so glad I did.Definitely a future reread.","So, being in a probably unusual position in not having read or seen the show of the Expanse series, also by SA Corey, I didn't know what to expect. I knew I loved Daniel Abraham, and so I was just hoping I would get more of what I love about his fantasy novels, and I could not have been more wonderfully surprised. This book is fantastic.It has everything I've come to love about Abraham's writing: nuanced characters with real, human emotion and motivations; characters who make decisions that are understandable but incredibly painful for the reader; and, probably my favorite thing that isn't as common as it should be--consequences for the characters actions, both the long and short prices paid for decisions. And the stakes could not be higher, while still feeling intimate and personal. There were several times in the book where I even pulled IRL a fake, clickbait youtube thumbnail pose by putting my palm on my forehead or against my temple because I was just that distraught by what I knew was to come.I don't read a ton of scifi, but I could not put this one down. The aliens feel alien. They're also awesome. The Carryx are unknowable, unbeatable, and possess unimaginable power. The world is fleshed out in a believable but not overwhelming way, and buzzwords and technobabble is easily understandable. It is possible this is my favorite sci-fi novel.Reading this book gave me the feeling I get when watching horror movies--feeling claustrophobic; not knowing what the conditions of the 'game' were, so to speak; dreading what would come next but not knowing who to trust; a sense of profound despair at the seemingly insurmountable odds.At its core, though, this is a book about trauma, and how we deal with it. How we each cope with loss so unfathomable that no one can avoid breaking. A book about what you make of life when you think you have no choices. A book about the things we as humans do to eke out a liveable existence, no matter the circumstances, and how each of us differs in our responses. I love the way this book handles mental illness, mental anguish, Stockholm Syndrome, and the idea of resistance versus surrender, of dying on your feet or serving on your knees. An absolutely tremendous read. My only caveat is that I have not read the Expanse, so I do not know how to compare it. I'm afraid I may be leading Expanse fans astray if it is appreciably different. Expect a full review on my channel in the next day or so.Thank you again to Netgalley for the ARC.","Utterly addictiveI finally read my first S.A. Corey book and started with The Mercy of Gods. I got caught up in the hype and wasn't quite ready to dive into The Expanse series, given its length of eight books.The Mercy of Gods was brilliant. Set in the distant future on a planet where humans have lived for over 3,000 years, the story unfolds in a civilization that has forgotten its origins and started anew. This new human society faces a severe threat when the alien race, the Carryx, arrives and takes away the brightest humans. The kidnapped humans are then forced to compete against other alien species, with extinction as the price of failure.There were several things that really drew me into this novel. The concept itself was incredibly captivating. This story reminded me a bit of Red Rising and Hunger Games but with a darker and more “sciency” undertone I appreciated that the aliens felt truly alien, rather than just humans with different appearances. Aliens are not supposed to act like humans as lots of modern franchises tend to do. S.A. Corey also did a phenomenal job at consistently adding intriguing layers and twists to the plot which consistently made me want to come back to the story – the stakes are really high! Probably my favourite part of the novel is that it felt horror-like in parts. The haunting scenario of a sophisticated alien race forcing humanity into a deadly game, were particularly compelling.I have two minor nitpicks. First, I didn't fall in love with any of the characters, although Dafyd, the protagonist, was definitely my favorite. The characters are not bad though. Second, while the aliens felt incredibly ""non-human,"" the humans felt almost…too human? Given that this human civilization has lived on another planet for 3,500 years, I expected their culture to be significantly different from Earth's in 2024. While there were some differences, I hoped to see more substantial cultural changes. However, I understand that the authors might have aimed to keep the humans relatable for readers, especially considering the aliens are not relatable at all, which could explain why they felt so much like modern humans.Fortunately, the plot was so compelling that this didn't detract significantly from my enjoyment of the story.I would definitely recommend adding this book to your tbr.4.5Thanks to Orbit for an arc in exchange for an honest review."
Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,Charles Duhigg,4.00,"Synopsis: Supercommunicators looks at what makes some people exceptional at connecting with others. Executives, politicians, community leaders, and CIA operatives were all interviewed and highlighted in Supercommunicators to prove that communication is more about listening and making others feel heard rather than speaking.Why does this book beguile? After his book, The Power of Habit, I was incredibly excited to get Duhigg's’ latest book as an ARC. I love learning about communication and ways to communicate better and more effectively. Supercommunicators is a great book if you’ve never explored material around empathy, listening, or communication. If you’re looking for a first book to launch you into the world of more effective communication, Supercommunicators will help you immensely.However, if you’ve read books like Dare to Lead by Brene Brown or Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss, most of this material will repeat what you’ve read. Because I’ve studied this material for a while, I found nothing groundbreaking or noteworthy. There were many good reminders of principles already learned, but nothing revelatory. I also feel strongly this book can be 100-150 pages shorter. Some of the anecdotes went on for far too long and felt disjointed from the point trying to be made.","This book shows us how to become Supercommunicators. Supercommunicators are individuals who consistently excel at conveying their ideas and connecting with others.We should ask ourselves 3 important questions in most of the conversations:1. What's this really about?2. How do we feel?3. Who are we?Specific techniques and approaches are discovered, offering practical strategies to improve communication.This book is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to enhance their communication skills.I need Daniel Kahneman's System 2 thinking to digest this book.","This is my first book by Charles Duhigg. I have heard so much about his previous books around adjusting your habits to reach your goals. For years I have obsessively read business books and articles related to my field of work. Communication has always been pivotal in reaching goals in a corporate environment. This book is elaborating the various communication styles based on the following three elements: ""What´s this really about?"" ""How do we feel?""""Who are we?""Training your amygdala NOT to take over a conversation with sudden emotions, but rather manage your conversation styles according to the above elements is easier said than done. Therefore, I really loved the examples and consequences that Duhigg elaborated, when the conversation is not led in style. The examples vary from convincing agents in the CIA right the work culture of Netflix and to private households. Obviously, asking questions as well as listening are major skills that a human being needs to master to lead an effective and efficient conversation. I also love the the win-win approach instead of the outdated approach to come out of a conversation as a so called ""winner"" whilst making your counterpart feel as a ""loser"". Communication is a field that I always see room for improvement in my work as well private environment. Hence, I feel lucky to have read this ARC. Thanks to NetGalley and Charles Duhigg. Crystal-clear recommendation for everyone who seeks to improve their conversation style as well as manage difficult conversations.Find me on instagram"
Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things,Adam M. Grant,4.11,"Everyone should uncover their hidden potential.Certainly, discovering the hidden potential in others is more challenging.Adam Grant has conducted research and identified methods to build character and create opportunities.The book is filled with fascinating real-world examples, from Olympic athletes to classroom teachers, illustrating how these principles can be applied across various contexts.By the way, I am also on a journey to discover my hidden potential.Good luck to all of us.","Edit (May 2025 reread): Even better the second time.God, I love Adam Grant.This book does exactly what it says on the tin: how to meet and extract your own hidden potential. We often get it wrong in evaluating what we and others are capable of, but through some really interesting examples, Grant will demonstrate how we can better meet goals, find fulfillment, and help others do the same.I get it. From the outside (meaning the covers, titles) his books look like self-help books for people looking to climb the corporate ladder. DON'T BE FOOLED! Grant is an organizational psychologist but his observations and insights touch on every part of our lives. His books have - no joke - changed my life many times over. He did it again in this book. Later today, I'm going to be taking his advice about turning practice into play and taking focus breaks.This was one of my favorite nonfiction books of 2024!Click here to hear more of my thoughts over on my Booktube channel, abookolive!","Adam Grant has been my favorite nonfiction author for several years now. His new book, Hidden Potential, delivers again and for me, was an excellent example of the right book at the right time! This book highlights the character we develop when we’re willing to try new things, make mistakes, and start before we truly feel ready. It’s about our growth. The early chapters of Hidden Potential especially resonated with me, and so did the epilogue. “Becoming a creature of discomfort can unlock hidden potential in many different types of learning. Summoning the nerve to face discomfort is a character skill-an especially important form of determination. It takes three kinds of courage: to abandon your tried-and-true methods, to put yourself in the ring before you feel ready, and to make more mistakes than others make attempts. The best way to accelerate growth is to embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort.”Most of suffer from imposter syndrome at one time or another. As Adam points out, when we feel others are overestimating us, we’re often underestimating ourselves.

Dopamine Detox : A Short Guide to Remove Distractions and Train Your Brain to Do Hard Things,"Thibaut Meurisse, Kerry J.  Donovan (Editor)",3.93,"DNF @ 33%Absolute, unhelpful nonsense. This ""book"" is more like one of those blog posts on predatory websites that swear to offer all the answers to life's problems while bringing nothing of any substance or value to the table. The only people who will benefit from it are those who want lives full of all work and no play - and even then, only those who are neurotypical and already have cushy, comfortable, privileged, financially secure lives.Lessons proposed by this book include:Don't rush and hustle and try desperately to make money; think patiently and play the long game (and I guess just pray you can pay your bills in the meantime). Don't check your emails or use message notifications; just let everything rot until later (better hope you didn't miss something important from work or family). Don't eat so much junk food; just buy healthier foods, which the author never acknowledges as being more expensive and ironically requiring more time ""wasted"" to prepare it. Don't communicate with your friends online; go exercise instead. Don't play video games or watch YouTube or start a series on Netflix; write a book or do work instead. And if you think you enjoy those recreational activities, you're invalid, and your brain has been ""hijacked.""Give me a break, here!This nonsense claiming to be a book is garbage at best and actively harmful at worst. It oversimplifies everything in a manner which often comes across as dystopian and as if the moral is that life sucks and anything fun (or the enjoyment thereof) is evil and dysfunctional. Also, poor and/or mentally disordered individuals don't exist. OCD? ADHD? Never heard of 'em. People who can't copy Jeff Bezos and wait for several years for their dream business to become profitable while eating multi-million-dollar losses along the way? Y'know, the majority of people in the world? Nah, we don't exist. (This book literally uses that as an example of good forward-thinking!)But more than that, the reason I DNF'd this garbage: it began to feel like being actively gaslighted with how frequently the author insisted readers' brains are ""being hijacked"" and repeated shallow points that amounted to ""fun bad even in moderation, work good always, you are being hijacked even if you don't believe you are, you are not satisfied by leisure activities or the internet even if you think you are."" No, just no. When I reached the point where it instructed:Using your action guide, complete the prompt below by being as specific as possible: My brain is being hijacked when…I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and knew I couldn't finish reading this, even though I was only even still hate-reading for how bad it is. One paragraph later, this decision was cemented with:When you are calm and focused, doing your main work can be surprisingly easy. You might even be excited, looking forward to making progress toward your biggest goals each day.The author had spent the previous 30% or more insisting upon the overly simplistic definition that the act of looking forward to a reward and being excited for it was the result of dopamine addiction. Being excited for an email from a friend, an achievement in a video game, or a fun video? Evil, bad, sign that the villain of the internet has hijacked your brain. But apparently being excited and looking forward to the reward of progress toward an approved goal is Totally Different and good and not at all governed by the same mental mechanisms.Maybe the author means well, but the air this presents is similar to that of being gaslighted into a cult. Everything else of a similar nature is bad and must be completely cut out. No. Just no.Moderation is the key. Balancing work and the life you actually like living (yeah, protip author: a large number of people in this world don't like their jobs and only have them out of necessity to survive) is important. Finding time for both fun hobbies and productivity is the goal, not erasing every hint of fun and working yourself to death. Distractions are hard to combat, but it's not because our brains are ""hijacked.""And y'know what? Maybe it's because I'm not neurotypical, but for me ""just don't access this distraction and instead do this other thing"" is the most useless advice ever. Telling me over and over that the things I feel genuine enjoyment from - the things which make life a little less worthless to me - are not ""really"" satisfying and that I'm some kind of victim? Lowkey triggering and high-key useless.I just wanted tips on balancing distractions and productivity, man. Not this tripe.Oh, by the way? There's apparently a workbook that goes along with this. It's referenced constantly, but in order to get it you have to use the Big Bad Internet to go to the author's linked website and provide your name and email address to sign up for a mailing list. I'm not about to hand over my info and do not want to be on the list, so I have no clue what the workbook contains. I do, however, find that rather scummy and worth a little shaming.","Really nothing groundbreaking… 70 pages of saying “spend less time on your phone to be more productive!” Not wrong, but this is really not an insightful, life-changing discovery either 😂(The irony is not lost on me that I finished this book & immediately grabbed my phone to mark it complete on Goodreads…)",I read the whole book in just 2 hours. Best book for social media addicted and distracted people. Read this book and get rid of hijacking your brain.
Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI,Ethan Mollick,4.01,"This is an interesting and useful book, and if you're an academic or educator who's trying to find a good strategy for dealing with the AI revolution then I strongly recommend reading it. Everyone I know in this area is having problems: the whole landscape has changed overnight now that students have access to ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and similar platforms. People have tried banning students from using them, which doesn't work, and they've tried ignoring the problem and hoping things will somehow just sort themselves out, which works even less. Ethan Mollick, a US professor of business studies, realised at an early stage that a more coherent approach was to embrace the new technology and learn to use it as well as possible. Even if you think this is absolutely the wrong thing to do, you should read about his experiences to see what embracing it might involve; a great many of your colleagues will be taking this route. Mollick has some extremely sensible advice to offer; at times it may seem paradoxical, but we're in a paradoxical situation. He repeatedly says that AIs are not human beings - in particular, he considers it clear that they are not conscious - but he also says that you will be better at using them if you treat them as though they were human beings. We don't yet have a good way to conceptualise AIs, and they behave much more like people than like the machines we're used to. He says in particular that it will be helpful to tell the AI what kind of person you want them to resemble, and gives nice examples of how useful it can be to have an AI who's been instructed to be, inter alia, the object of a sales pitch, a critical reader of your essay, or a potentially interested but uninformed member of the public. He repeatedly urges you to be sceptical and gather information. The abilities of current-generation AIs are often hard to imagine until you've actually tried them on a given task: a striking example which many people have discovered independently is that ChatGPT can't spot a one move threat at Tic-Tac-Toe, but if asked will immediately write you a Python script that plays the game perfectly. Who would have predicted that?Mollick not merely encourages but requires his students to use AI, and shows you how much they can get out of it. The teacher can dramatically raise the bar, since every member of the class now has a competent virtual team working for them. You don't have to limit business students to describing the website they would build; even if they can't code, you ask them actually to build a prototype, relying on the AI to take care of the implementation. Mollick says he can't code, but found this worked for him, and he's passing on his experience. The technology is improving all the time, and things which were difficult or impossible a few months ago may be quite feasible in the next release. ChatGPT 3.5, which took the world by storm in November 2022, is already starting to feel quaint and old-fashioned. When the voice-enabled version of ChatGPT-4o becomes generally available (looks like it will be Q3/Q4 2024), we'll hit another inflection point. Video capabilities are evidently in the pipeline, as are other less in-your-face but possibly even more important improvements related to planning and reasoning. The impact on education will be revolutionary. Mollick quotes well-known studies showing that personal tuition gives students a two-sigma advantage, moving an average student to the 98th percentile. We are within sight of a world where all students in all but the poorest countries will be able to get expert personal tuition in all subjects.Where is this going long-term? Mollick honestly says he doesn't know, and there's little point in speculating; what makes sense is to keep up with events and understand what new options are materialising, whether we like them or not. It's possible that AI development will plateau or at least start levelling off. But that isn't what it looks like right now. It's not accidental that we see the Apple of Eden on the front cover.Such extraordinary times we're living in.","As someone who keeps up with Ethan Mollick's Substack and as someone who's quite interested in AI, I picked up this book instantly.It's a solid layman's introduction to the current state of LLMs. Well-written, but if you've been playing around with AI yourself, there's likely nothing new here. This book is written for the rank beginner and does a good job at highlighting all the different ways LLMs can be used today, with examples.Personally I was disappointed with how the book seemed content to give only a broad surface level overview of the state of LLMs. It would have been interesting for it to have dived deeper into the differences between Claude, GPT-4, Gemini etc, and it would've also been cool if it touched upon the implications of local models. However, I understand also that it's a rapidly changing space and devoting too much time to the nitty-gritty of what's happening today runs the risk of making the book obsolete in a few months. And to be fair, Ethan Mollick does in fact give his thoughts on the current frontier models on his Substack: https://open.substack.com/pub/oneusef...All in all, it does what it does well. If I were to meet someone who is completely ignorant about LLMs and what can be done with LLMs today, I'd recommend this book. For more detailed dives on AI, I'd recommend reading the articles on Mollick's Substack as well as keeping up with TheZvi's weekly AI roundup.","I wanted to love this book -- and while it's funny and humorous, it's basically a long blog post or online message board discussion. The conversations with AI are amusing - but not substantive.The author talks about anthropomorphization -- and dismisses people talking to their pets as the same as talking to their cars or other inanimate objects. And yet - he wants to make a case for AI being some kind of ""alien mind"" - when he's making a stronger case for it as a mirror of our own expectations. Throughout the book he talks about how AI is filling in the most probable or likely response -- so if you say ""To be or not ___ "" it's going to say ""to be"" since that is the most probable. If you say ""The alien ate a banana because ___"" you'll get more variety every time you ask the question because it's not a topic or subject reflected in the AI training corpus. AI is just another way for us to summarize back all the stuff we've written/created with words or images -- to us. It's more like a fun-house mirror than an intelligence. My cats are more intelligent and capable of communication than an AI -- so where does this leave us? Humans want to imagine that AI is more intelligent because it sounds like us and tells us what we want to hear. AI is very conformist - it will rewrite and reshape your thoughts and ideas to make them more appealing based upon the corpus of information it has already digested. It will align your communication to meet the greatest common denominator. You can ask it questions and it will tell you to analyze ""Heart of Darkness"" vis a vis Jane Austen's marriage plots -- and come up with some reasonably interesting points based on what it expects are most probable points from what we have already fed it. NOT because it's thinking of these things. Rather, AI acts as a sophisticated tool for summarizing and regurgitating information in a manner that aligns with human expectations.I'd like to see a deeper exploration of AI's capabilities and limitations beyond surface-level interactions examining the fundamental nature of AI and its true intelligence compared to human and even animal cognition. The author quotes someone who says that humans are just a historical point in the evolution of ""intelligence"" as if that is an autonomous being or subject. I'd contend that it is not -- we aren't merely vessels for ""intelligence."" There's no hierarchy of value based on ""intelligence.""However, I do appreciate the author's optimism that AI will remove the boring/redundant tasks from human labor and his call to consider universal basic income and healthcare as real needs as humans move toward an era where we should focus our attention on tasks and activities that are more intrinsically rewarding to us and which do not require a 40 hour (or more) work week. The mythical 4 day work week has been promised for decades, the practicalities of achieving a reducing ""full time"" work weeks remain uncertain. Striking a balance between dystopian and utopian visions of AI's impact on society is crucial for informed decision-making."
A Brief History of Time,Stephen Hawking,4.21,"This book puts me in mind of the story about how a Harvard number theorist, through some malfunction of the scheduling computer, got assigned to teach an introductory course in pre-calculus. Being one of those individuals to whom math came so easily that they couldn't grasp how difficult others found it, the professor had no idea what to cover in such a course. So, he went to the chair of the department, who told him: ""You'll want to start with the real number-line and then progress to inequalities; from there, move on to quadratic equations, then trigonometry and the wrapping function, Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, and, if time permits, conic sections.""The professor thanked the chairperson and went off to meet with his first class. Next week, he was back.""What should I teach them now?"" he said.A Brief History of Time is like that -- Professor Hawking doesn't seem to notice when his treatment progresses from the obvious to the arcane, ending with his concept of ""imaginary time"" (very nearly incomprehensible in this overly brief presentation).Fun nonetheless.* * *August 30, 2022 addendum --Time to jump in here, I fear:Having garnered over 650 ""Likes,"" this far-from-serious scribble is by far my most popular review ever — and, truth be told, undeservedly so.For a more thoughtful consideration of a somewhat related book, try my take on Jim Holt's Why Does the World Exist? here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8...","It is not clear to me who is in the target audience for this book. At times it tries to explain basic concepts of modern physics in simple language, and at other times it assumes a familiarity with the same subject. For the first time I think I ""understand"" why absolute time is not consistent with relativity theory or that space-time curvature supplants the notion of gravity, and for that I thank the author. There are a few other things I believe I have a glimpse of having (finally) slogged through the book.On the other hand, there are many places where he writes as if it were clear what he is talking about even though it would require a good deal of background knowledge. To give but one example, he starts talking about summing up over possible world histories (I cannot locate the quotation) without explaining what that would mean. Trained in statistics, I have some idea that he is talking about mathematical expectation in the context of quantum mechanics, but I don't know how another reader might make any sense of it (and I certainly don't have more than a vague notion). There are irritating writing practices that could have used some editing, e.g., the use of the naked pronominal adjective ""this"" when in the middle of a dense explanation of an abstruse concept(e.g., ""This had serious implications for the ultimate fate of massive stars.""). My biggest complaints, however, are about his philosophical opinions. Obviously he is entitled to think as he wishes about the ultimate questions, but his assertion that his hypothesis of a finite world without beginning or end would leave no place for God seems beside the point. The classic divide has not changed: some folks look around and say stuff just is, and other folks say there's a power behind the stuff that has at least as much going for it as we do. That argument hasn't changed with his theories. At one point in the book he claims that the late John Paul II told gathered scientists that they mustn't inquire into the Big Bang because that was God's territory. I would wager with anyone reading this comment that such an assertion is just plain false. JPII was a flawed mortal, to be sure, but he was no dope; it certainly sounds to me like someone hearing what he thinks the pope would say. (And the Galileo jokes are pretty dumb -- does anyone think that JPII, who apologized for the embarrassing Galileo fiasco, would go after this guy? It must be all that influence the Vatican has had in Britain over the last 400 years that has him scared.) Other philosophical complaints involve his use of entropy (he defines it first within closed systems and then uses it to explain why the ""thermodynamic arrow of time"" and the ""personal arrow of time"" must run in the same direction -- leaping from a box of molecules to the entire universe!), his droning on about what black holes are like when he doesn't know for sure they exist, his statements about ""random"" and being 95% certain a theory is true (does that mean about 95 out of 100 theories like that are true??). His opinions may be very rich, deep, though-provoking, but how would I (or most general readers) know? You can't really evaluate a judgment unless you know something in the field. And so that is why I ultimately cannot recommend this book: if you know physics inside and out, you might find his opinions interesting. If you don't, you can only walk around parroting what he says about black holes as if you had a clue what you were talking about. What we all really need is a remedial course in physics!","‎‏‏=وداعا هوكنج=صرت حرا الآن---------هناك لذّةٌ ما ،، في أن تفتحَ كتاباً تشعُّ من سطوره ألوان الفضاء شيءٌ ما في فعلِ المعرفةِ ،، والتأمل فيها

العشرينفيقول_______________________________________________‎وبالتأمل وراء، فإن من السهل التعجب لآن ‏أحدا لم يفكر في ذلك من قبل ، فقد كان ينبغي على ‏‏نيوتن وغيره أن يتبينوا أن كونا ستاتيكيا لن يلبث أن ‏يبدأ سريعا في الانكماش بتأثير الجاذبية‏ولكن ‏لنفرض بدلا من ذلك أن الكون يتمدد . فلو كان يتمدد ‏بسرعة بطيئة إلى حد ما ، فإن قوة ‏الجاذبية ستجعله ‏في النهاية يتوقف عن التمدد ليبدأ بعدها في ‏الانكماش . أما إذا كان يتمدد بسرعة ‏أكبر من معدل ‏حرج عين ، فإن الجاذبية لن تكون قط قوية بما يكفي ‏لوقف تمدده ، وسوف يستمر ‏الكون في التمدد للأبد  ‏وهذا يشبه ، نوعا ، ما يحدث عندما يطلق أحدهم من ‏فوق سطح الأرض ‏صاروخا لأعلى . فإذا كانت ‏سرعته بطيئة إلى حد ما ، فإن الجاذبية ستوقف ‏الصاروخ في النهاية ‏وسيبدأ في السقوط عائدا ومن ‏الجهة الأخرى ، إذا كانت سرعة الصاروخ أكبر من ‏سرعة ‏حرجة معينة ( حوالي سبعة أميال في الثانية ‏‏) فإن الجاذبية لا تكون قوية بما يكفي لشدة إلى ‏‏الوراء ، وهكذا فإنه سيستمر في الانطلاق بعيدا عن ‏الأرض إلى الأبد . وسلوك الكون هكذا كان ‏يمكن ‏التنبؤ به من نظرية نيوتن عن الجاذبية في أي

A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,4.22,"A Short History of GoodreadsSurveys show that nearly 40% of all Americans believe the history of literature started in 2007, when Amazon sold the first Kindle; indeed, Amazon Fundamentalists hold it as an article of faith that Jeff Bezos actually wrote all the world's e-books over a period of six days. This is, of course, nonsense. It has been conclusively demonstrated that literature is far older than the Kindle; books already existed thousands of years ago, which were the direct ancestors of today's e-publications. For example, careful examination reveals that The Odyssey and The Gospel according to Saint Mark are primitive versions of Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters and Bared to You. Similar relationships have been shown to obtain for all modern books.Problems arise, however, from the fact that these archaic protobooks still exist today; indeed, some have adapted to the e-reader environment and begun to thrive there. It is entirely too easy for an unsuspecting internet shopper to purchase a copy of Pride and Prejudice, incorrectly believing that it is part of the Twilight series. From the standpoint of formal literary theory, it is admittedly incorrect to say that Pride and Prejudice is ""worse"" than Twilight. They are simply different; neither one is ""worse"" than the other, since they have developed in different environments. From a practical point of view, however, a person who buys a Jane Austen novel is almost certain to be disappointed. There are no vampires or werewolves; sex is barely even hinted at; most upsettingly of all, the book will be full of long sentences and difficult words. The combination of these factors can only lead to an intensely unpleasant reading experience, which may discourage the reader from making new Amazon purchases for days or even weeks afterwards. Particularly given the fragile state of the US economy, this is evidently not an acceptable state of affairs.People have always exchanged recommendations and warnings with their friends, but it became clear that a more systematic approach was needed. There had to be a place where book-consumers could post advice and help each other avoid these infuriating mistakes, so that everyone could be sure of reading nothing but up-to-the-minute YA erotic paranormal romances. Thus was born Goodreads.This work by Manny is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License","Good grief if I had even one textbook half this enthralling in high school, who knows what kind of impassioned -ologist I would have grown up to be. I hereby petition Bryson to re-write all curriculum on behalf of the history of the world.I would run across things half-remembered from midterms and study guides and think, ""You mean this is what they were talking about? You have got to be kidding me."" It's never condescending, always a joy.In fact, what I loved most is the acute, childlike sense of wonder seeping through the pages. How fantastic little we know about the world in which we live. All the great scientific leaps fallen through the cracks, all the billions of leaps that will never be made, every scientist who with an amiable grin shrugs to say, ""I don't know. We don't know. Who has any idea?"" The world is a magically baffling, enchanting place, and after nearly everything there is infinitesimally more.","Okay, so here's my Bill Bryson story. I was in The Gladstone, a public house not too far from this very keyboard, with my friend Yvonne, who will remain nameless. We had been imbibing more than freely. A guy approached our table and asked me in a sly surreptitious manner if I was him. Him who? Was I Bill Bryson? Now it is true that I bear a very slight resemblancebut you could also say that about Bjorn from Abbaand a zillion other white guys with beards and gently rounded fizzogs. Anyway, without missing a beat I said yes, I was him. So the guy immediately asked me if I'd sign two of his books, and before I could say ""Come on mate, I'm not actually American, can't you bleedin well tell?"" he had zapped out of the pub. Only to zap straight back with two hardbacks of Bill's deathless works. What could I do? He opened them up reverentially and told me one would be for him and one for his mother. Friends, I signed them - ""Best wishes, your friend Bill Bryson"". He was so grateful, so very very pleased. We drank up and got the hell out of there. I look back on this disgraceful incident and shudder. That's the last time I'm impersonating a famous author.Short note on the book in question:There was no way our Bill could write a gently humorous book about the history of all of science without sounding like a fairly smirky know-it-all, so that's what he does sound like, which can be just a trifle wearing. LOTS of good info in here, but it's like being forced to live on Indian takeaways and nothing else, great for a while and then GET ME A SANDWICH! Or like being stuck on a long airplane ride with a very garrolous and opinionated fellow who thinks he is the very model of the modern travelling companion, regaling you with insightful and humourous anecdotes by the bucketful while you're wondering if it would be so bad if you faked a heart attack and you could whisper to the flight attendant ""I'm okay really but GET ME AWAY FROM THIS GUY!"""
The Selfish Gene,Richard Dawkins,4.16,"- What some people seem to find hard to understand is that there's a part of you, in fact the most important part, that's immaterial and immortal. Your body is really no more than a temporary shell for the immortal part, and houses it for a little while until it dies. But what you do during that short time is very important. If you live well, the immortal part of you will become absorbed in something much bigger than you are. It will grow and change and achieve things that you can't even dream of. Start thinking of life in these terms, and you will have a completely new perspective on it.- Hey, I didn't know you believed in—- In genes? Well of course I do. What did you think I was talking about?","Didactic, patronizing, condescending and arguably neo-intellectual twaddle. I do not believe in a God, certainly not any God that's been conceived by man, but I also believe Richard Dawkins is a self-satisfied thought-Nazi who is as fundamental in his view of religion as any right-wing minister. Fundamentalists of all faiths scare me, and atheism is just as much a faith as any religion. The existence or non-existence of a God cannot be proven, nor can the existence or non-existence of a soul, and faith is an abstract experience with implications that are fundamentally unresponsive to study. As such, pursuits like Dawkins' often boil down to one type of faith (in ""reason"") vs. another type of faith (in a ""God""). Many people love Dawkins. He is certainly intelligent, and writes as such, but he lacks wisdom and imagination. To me, that's the flaw in all of his work, from The Selfish Gene to The God Delusion. The idea that one human being can know enough about the nature of the universe to make the sweeping declarations Dawkins' makes is preposterous to me, and no more credible than the sweeping declarations of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson.NC","If you are bored look up the Community Reviews, sort by 1-star. They are very entertaining. One of them as a uni professor advising a student to burn down the book store where they bought this book. Then we have the creationists, then the person who thinks it is all a capitalist manifesto. There are those who think he is arrogant, depraved, uses philistine language (!) ... How can anyone be a creationist and not believe in dinosaurs and such? Do they believe that the earth is flat? Are they the sort of people who pay astrologers money to cast their charts because of course your fate is determined by the stars at the moment of your birth? Jesus wept. Or he would have. I'm reading Josephus at the moment, it seems that the only mention of Jesus at the time he was living was in Josephus but that it might have been added later... That's a whole other story, and one which Dawkins might have liked, but these one-star creationists certainly won't."
Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,Neil deGrasse Tyson,4.08,"Imagine you are standing with your face up and your mouth wide open underneath a waterfall of Skittles. At first, a few Skittles get into your mouth and you can taste them. Awesome, you think. I love Skittles.Then, the Skittles become overwhelming, as more and more try to force themselves in, and millions and millions puddle around your feet, piling up past your knees.That's kind of how this was.I'm all about learning new things, but there were SO MANY FACTS IN SUCH A SMALL SPAN. By the time I hit page twenty, I realized I was mentally absent as my eyes and mind processed words but failed to commit those words to actual thought. I wanted to love this book.

Nothing like an astrophysics book for beginners to remind me why I’m not an astrophysicist! Even at the basic level, with Tyson’s clear, funny and accessible writing, I found a lot of these concepts WAY over my head. Nevertheless, it is fascinating stuff. My big takeaway was humility: just how small humans are in the grand scheme of things, and there is something freeing about that. It reminded me of a fake headline on The Onion news satire site that made me chuckle: Obama Reassures Americans: ‘The future, and I’m talking three billion years from now, is still bright.”The amount we don’t know about the universe is staggering. Dark matter, dark energy . . . how can we be completely unaware of forces that make up the bulk of our universe? But also, how amazing is it that we can find this stuff out from our little speck of a planet in the suburbs of Nowheresville, Milky Way Galaxy? This is a short book, perfect, as the title says, for people in a hurry. If you would like your mind exploded by science, and get a few chuckles out of the deal, check it out!","We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, within 224 pages, attempts to cover the entirety space and time. He does a pretty good job.  However,  this is not  Astrophysics for Dummies. There are assumptions made for the audience - you do need a bit of a working knowledge on particles and space to fully understand the significance of the text. That being said, I could still (mostly) follow along even in the areas where I knew little to nothing about.This is somewhat similar to Bill Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything but with less emphasis on human accomplishments. Like Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson provides great analogies when he explains the creation (and subsequent formation) of the universe. If we combine both books, it feels like we get a Short History of Everything.However...he does waste page space needling his audience about religion, which I could've definitely done without in such a compact book. (It felt rather distasteful).I really liked how Tyson could break down complex topics.
Matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to move.
And how he was able to inject humor in such dry matter.
The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.
I would like a sequel called 
Astrophysics for People with Time on their Hands

The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,4.34,"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book bound to appear on a large number of coffee tables and favorite lists, and be picked up even by those who normally would not find the time for reading. It will certainly not be the next A Brief History of Time, which is often named as the world's top unfinished popular bestseller.Both A Brief History of Time and Sapiens share a similar, worthy goal - to explain complex issues in a way which can actually be understood and comprehended by most people. Just as A Brief History... aimed at explaining cosmology to a lay audience, Sapiens aims to provide a readable and concise historical summary of the progress of human evolution - all in under 500 pages.Is this possible? Of course not - histories of individual countries often take up several volumes, and histories of entire civilizations and ultimately an entire specie would take up hundreds if not thousands of volumes. Because Harari's book is limited to just a single volume (and a relatively short one at that), he has to severely limit his scope to what he considers to be the biggest life-changing developments of our species, which essentially reduces it to a collection of trivia about these events. But that's not the true flaw of the book. Sapiens begins strong enough with a very interesting presentation of early human history and development of early human species, which culminated in the rise and eventual dominance of our own - the Homo Sapiens. However, the rest of the book consists largely of author's own musings and thoughts about the human condition and character - while some of these thoughts I find interesting and agreeable (such as our collective belief in the value of money), one thesis he that he put forward struck me as truly bizarre.Basically, Harari considers the agricultural revolution to be ""history's biggest fraud"", which instead of improvement left humans who settled down to farm worse off and more miserable than their nomadic, foraging ancestors. To prove his point, Harari waxes poetics about hunter-gatherers and their daily existence: they lived in egalitarian communes where property and love was freely shared, and were much more adept at survival in the wilderness than their descendants who plowed the fields. Hunter-gatherers had to have a much larger knowledge of their surroundings, and possessed vastly superior mental reflexes and physical dexterity which put future generations to shame. Although we have since gained vast knowledge as a collective, Harari argues that on the individual level ancient foragers were ""the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history"".For Harari, our foraging ancestors were not only mental and physical supermen, but also enjoyed a much more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than all the subsequent peasants, workers and office clerks. They worked fewer hours and since they had no homes, they also had no household chores; this allowed for plenty of free time to play with one another, tell stories and just hang out. Since foraging necessitated exploration, it also provided plenty of adventure: what better thing to do than explore new places to look for cool plants and other edible things? Because they were always on the move and therefore not dependent on a single source of food, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a superior, multi-nutrient diet and were less likely to suffer from hunger and starvation than subsequent agricultural societies, which often depended on a single crop, and not only were receiving much less nutrients but also suffered heavily from famines when their food source failed. Farming? Bah! Humbug.True, there were some drawbacks, Harari reluctantly agrees. Although some lucky souls made it longer, life expectancy averaged only 30 to 40 years. Children dropped dead like flies, and sometimes wild tigers came out of the bushes and ate you and your whole family and tribe. Not to mention that sometimes you and your band wandered and wandered, and the food simply wasn't there. Or even worse - the food was there, but so was another tribe which was not exactly keen on sharing their already limited supply. What about this? ""It would be a mistake to idealize the lives of these ancients"", says the author, though I do not really understand why, since this is exactly what he appeared to be doing, ""though they lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial societies, their world could still be harsh and unforgiving."" Ain't that the truth. Sometimes, life is just hard. Rocks fall, everyone dies. But agricultural revolution? It sucked, Harari argues. First, he has unnamed (and presumably fictitious) scholars proclaim the development of agriculture as ""a great leap forward for humanity"", which ""produced ever more intelligent people(...)able to decipher nature’s secrets"". But this is not true - ""there is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time"", he says, as ""foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered"". As I mentioned above, Harari states that agricultural revolution made things worse for farmers - it robbed them from excitement of hunting and gathering by forcing them to settle down next to their fields and perform menial farm work, which strained our joints and spine. Although farming provided a surplus of food it did not provide the farmer with a better diet, robbing us of the diversity of meals experienced by a hunter-gatherer. Farming also failed to provide us with economic security - crops can always fail and lead to hunger, whereas hunter-gatherers can always move on and hunt for other types of food (unless, of course, they do not find any and starve to death). Farmers also had to stay and defend their land if attacked by a hostile group, whereas foragers could always escape to another area, look for food there, and survive (they could, of course, end up not being able to escape -who can fight or run on an empty stomach? - or...not find any food, and starve to death).So, what exactly has agriculture ever done for us? Since it has taken so much not only from our fathers but also from from our fathers' fathers, what has it ever given us in return? The aqueduct? Sanitation? Wine? And why have humans not returned to hunting and gathering but stubbornly toiled their fields and broke their miserable backs, while they could be climbing trees and camping in the wilderness? The answer is simple: more food allowed women to have children more often, and even though they still died fairly often this time births outpaced deaths several times. Village population increased, and soon entire generations of people no longer remembered the good old days of running in the forests and looking for berries. ""The trap"", Harari writes, ""was shut"".He goes on to say: ""Since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement"".Yet, we are wrong in thinking this, because ""it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today"" (though apparently not when it comes to foraging, which was a blast by all accounts - that is, the author's). Harari neglects to mention the exact reason why the agricultural revolution took place - farming first arose in places where hunting and gathering was no longer possible, and in the long run prevailed as the better option. Hunter-gatherers simply did not choose to one day walk out of the woods and start domesticating animals and plants; they were forced to do that because the environment they were living no longer allowed for foraging to remain a viable option. The Younger Dryas interval in ancient Levant is often linked to the adoption of agriculture in the region, as an example of the first deliberate cultivation of plants. People understood that seeds developed into plants at the time when they desperately needed to increase their food supply in order to survive, and linked one with the other.It is interesting that Harari does not only romanticize hunting and gathering, but actually looks at the agricultural revolution and its impact from a perspective of a hunter and gatherer - that is, focusing on the thing that mattered most to our foraging ancient ancestors: food. Hunter-gatherers spend their lives pursuing food; as Harari admits, because of their nomadic lifestyle they had very few possessions, as they were constantly moving around in search for food to sustain them. Food was their driving force; their lives centered around food, as they never had a steady supply of it and always had to hunt and look for more if they were to survive. In contrast, agricultural revolution provided humans with a steady and regular supply of food, and or the first time in our history allowed humans to take our minds off food and constant travel. The impact of this is monumental and cannot be stressed enough. Basically, without agricultural revolution, our knowledge would be stagnant - as we would simply not have the luxury of time to develop it. Food surplus and settling down allowed humans to think more and develop new ideas and technologies, allowing for more efficient farming - which in turn allowed for more time to think and develop even more ideas and technologies. In contrast to general knowledge of our forager ancestors, surplus of food and settler lifestyle allowed for skill specialization, which in turn allowed us to do things beyond their wildest dreams, and become technologically advanced. Basically, I would argue that societies comprised of hunter-gatherers cannot advance and live up to the full human potential - it is impossible to have a truly technologically advanced nomadic society, while it is possible to have a technologically advanced settler society which is able to send some of its members into the world as hunter-gatherers. To put it very simply: hunter-gatherers live in the wilderness, living day to day on what they find or hunt down, while agriculturists discover penicillin, split the atom and fly into space.Although the author later brings up valid concerns about our treatment of animals and abuse of collective power, his rant against agriculture is truly bizarre considering that without it he would not be able to write this very book. It's as if he disregarded the very Sapiens which he aimed to describe, and which has defied his thesis by abandoning hunting and gathering to settle down and farm. Still, there are good parts and certain valuable and interesting insights in this book - it's just a shame that it's tainted with such a weird and contrived chapter.","“The best-selling author is a gifted storyteller and popular speaker. But he sacrifices science for sensationalism, and his work is riddled with errors.” —Current Affairs—— This book is a superficial gloss on human history. Nice try but it excludes too much subject matter in favor of an overarching conceptual view to be deeply interesting. Stopped reading for reasons detailed below at p. 304 of 416.Considering the outlandishness of some of its claims—the downside of the Agricultural Revolution, the joys of Empire—the book seems weirdly under-sourced. The bibliography is beyond meagre. Don't get me wrong, I like a little informed speculation as much as anyone. Take for example the claim that houses, their advent, ""became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature."" (p. 99) I, for one, would be delighted to know how one can discern the psychology of someone who lived more than 9,000 years ago. The apparently relevant note cited is ""2 Robert B. Marks, The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Ecological Narrative"". But when one looks up Mr. Marks' book one sees that it pertains only to the 15th to the 21st centuries CE.Another thing, the book seems all biological determinism—and we know what that sort of thinking led to: the Konzentrationslager. The life of the mind is nothing here, the intellect nothing, all because it has no discernible basis in biology—so reductive and materialist, too. I'm hoping this is just a rhetorical device. Please, let it be. Moreover, the author cherishes a certain sneering and glib tone which I find annoying. Well, yes, now he's changing his tune, isn't he? But not before thoroughly pissing me off. Was that necessary? Ah, now he's starting to celebrate the very social constructs—the law, the state, joint stock corporations, etc.—that he so glibly belittled as ""imaginary myths"" a few pages back. So his earlier arguments were disingenuous. That's not something I prize in a writer. Notwithstanding the questionable attempt to raise the reader's hackles, just mentioned, I find myself on p. 170 and 95% of this is material I already know. Granted, the author tries to package it as felicitously as possible, but it's still stuff I know and, no doubt, material my well read GR friends will also know. What I had hoped for on cracking this formidable spine was something far more intellectually challenging, like Naipaul. Still, I find myself nursing a hope that this is just an overly long introduction to a thrilling thesis. At the same time I fear it will turn out to be another tedious read for a far less learned general reader than myself. Am I overqualified for this book? Trepidation abounds. 2.0 stars so far, inauspicious. Meh. It's really an undergraduate survey course, if that. It's a great review of common knowledge that seeks to find new linkages and epiphanies. It sometimes works. But often the linkages are specious. As when he terms liberal humanism a religion. It isn't, though it's a neat shorthand for his minimalist theories. Now I'm reading about how religions are unifiers. The author certainly has a flair for the obvious, I'll say that much. Here's an example of author Harari's reductiveness, which is inevitable in a book skirting so many vast subjects. On p. 232 we read: ""The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman."" Nietzsche is nowhere mentioned. The statement is wholly lacking in context—the Nazis are glossed but that's all. It really doesn't make coherent sense. Gloss, that's the word that best describes this book. A gloss.The writer is careless with metaphors. We're told that cultures are ""mental parasites,"" that ""history disregards the happiness of individuals"" and that ""history made its most momentous choice."" (p. 243-244). To say such things is to give agency to the non-sentient and adds to the narrative's by now utterly grating superficiality. Here's yet another bizarro statement:Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding them – and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbors – they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. (p.292)Nonsense. The Spaniards had guns, germs and steel. Reread Jared Diamond and William H. Prescott, Mr. Harari. Foreknowledge would have availed the indigenous peoples little or nothing. The author goes on to admit as much in the paragraphs to follow, but why then wasn't that earlier sentence cut? But it gets better: If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the fates of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the invaders. But they did not now....[Thus] the native peoples of America...[paid] a heavy price for their parochial outlook.It's astonishing the author should use that ecclesiastical word. For what was the ostensible motivation of the conquerors but the glory of Christendom. Harari is blaming the victims. The world view of the Aztecs and Incas and others was limited. Harari blames them because they had not yet advanced beyond that basic if incomplete awareness. He then goes on to excoriate all of Asia and Africa for not having had the wherewithal to explore the world and conquer others. But these are cultural predilections, not standardized goals applicable to all. This leads to an unseemly West is the Best argument that's right out of Niall Ferguson's Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order. Is this book popular because it essentially functions as the West's cheering section? It's lovely we have developed science and technology and historiography etc. I'm glad I live in the West. But it's absurd to say that earlier cultures, because they did not develop in a timely manner our own particular brand of curiosity, were deficient. All cultures are blood soaked, our own included. The world is only what it is, not some counter-factual supposition.—Read instead: The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity by David Graeber and David Wengrow.","I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none. Instead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conquer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage.Harari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence.I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.[I also have a frivolous review of the book here.]"
Cosmos,Carl Sagan,4.40,"Can I give this one ten stars? If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian. Love him so much.","I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one.","The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot,4.13,"The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog.","This is an all-gold ten-star read!It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here.","“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions,Randall Munroe,4.14,This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. And I have read over 10 books.,"I've been a reader of XKCD for ages. Not just a reader, a fan. A big goey, geeky fan. So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did.","Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"
The Origin of Species,Charles Darwin,4.01,"such a freakin' genius! and the sadest part is, that his ""science"" literally killed him. if you've read a lot in Darwin (as I have) you come to understand that as a religious man, his studies seriously conflicted with his beliefs. I hate it when I hear someone say that Darwin says, ""we come from monkeys."" because that is not the case.his theory is on EVOLUTION, not monkeys. all he wanted people to understand was adaptation and survival of the fittest is really a simple concept, and daily life- proves just that.his theories don't have to impede on your beliefs in God. he was a Christian man, himself, but could still see the science before his very eyes. give it a shot if you are intrigued by species changing, growing, dying, extinction, over time...","A founding text of the thought of humanity. What a pleasure to immerse yourself in the world of a nineteenth-century naturalist. We touch on daily life by consulting a mass of documents on the insects of Central Asia and the beetles of Paraguay, observing the life of an anthill for days and days every year. Argue in front of a wall of perplexed scholars or conquered on the natural selection and evolution of species and then scrolls in our mind a list of plants and animal species ranging from cabbage, holly, oak, and Sylvester pine to the silk, the wolf, the cock of heather and the alligator. Like many men of his time, Charles Darwin is an observer who enjoys trying to try the results, observing them, and analyzing them to conclusions. So it is returning, through his work's reading, to the scientific methodology that has imposed itself as a rule in the nineteenth century. His tremendous observation capacity points out phenomena that he can not explain by his theory of evolution but that will be known a few years later, thanks to the appearance of genetics.","Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory",Brian Greene,4.10,"[Original review, written December 2008]When I read this book, I remember thinking it was pretty interesting, but I am surprised how few insights I have retained... to be honest, hardly any. Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, which I read much more recently, suggests that string theory is in big trouble, and right now I am more tempted to side with Smolin.There's this old Nasrudin story, where he's somehow ended up as judge in a court case. The D.A. really makes a good case, and Nasrudin can't restrain himself. ""Yes, you're right!"" he shouts. Then the defense lawyer gets up and makes his pitch, and Nasrudin is equally impressed. ""Yes, you're right!"" he shouts again. The court recorder clears his throat and leans over towards Nasrudin. ""Your honor,"" he says respectfully, ""they can't both be right!"". Nasrudin shakes his head. ""Yes, you're right!"" he agrees.Well, between Greene and Smolin I feel a bit like Nasrudin, but luckily I am not the judge here. Am I just agreeing with Smolin because I heard him most recently? Maybe. But trying to correct for that, I still think that there is a reason why Smolin seems more convincing and memorable, and why very little of what Greene says has stuck. String theory has become so divorced from experimental reality that it rarely if ever gives you that feeling you get from good science, of suddenly grasping a real physical phenomenon that you have known about for a while, but not understood. I guess the example that makes me least happy is supersymmetry, according to which every particle has a supersymmetric partner. Compare this with the discovery of the periodic table in the late 19th century, or the development of the Standard Theory in the 60s and 70s. There, insightful people gradually realized that objects (atoms in the first case, subatomic particles in the second) were related in a complicated pattern. Most of the time the pattern fit, but there were a few holes, and they were later able to find the things (new elements, new particles) that filled in the holes! I was astonished to read that there is not one single particle which has a known supersymmetric partner - so far, it's all hypothesis, and perhaps none of these ""selectrons"", ""photinos"" etc actually exist. I'm not saying that this means supersymmetry is wrong; I'm just saying it means I don't find it exciting. Maybe next year they will get the LHC working, discover a whole slew of supersymmetric partners (even one would be a lot), and put string theory on a proper experimental footing. If that happens, I'm sure I'll go back to reading books on this subject; I won't be able to stop myself. But until then, well, it may be beautiful math, but I feel no emotional connection to it. I'd love to hear from people who disagree, and can explain to me just what it is I'm missing out on.__________________________________[Update, May 2011]We had another particle physicist over for dinner last night. He'd come mainly to play chess, but when I found out that he was involved in looking for supersymmetric particles I took the opportunity to ask how it was going. Well: assuming he's to be trusted, and he sounded pretty knowledgeable on the subject, we should know pretty soon. The LHC is now up to high enough energies. They're collecting data. If supersymmetric particles exist, there is every reason to suppose that we'll have clear evidence of them within a year or two.I wondered what would happen if they didn't find any supersymmetric particles? Would the theoreticians just retreat into saying that they needed a more powerful collider? Not so, said my informant; if the particles can't be found at the current range of energies, the predictions were wrong. Sounds like we're finally getting a straight up-or-down vote.String theory, you can run but you can't hide!__________________________________[Update, September 2011]I knew it was too good to be true. We had yet another particle physicist over, whose PhD topic had been something to do with searching for a supersymmetric quark. I asked her if it really was the case that we'd soon know if supersymmetric particles existed.Alas, it turns out that, although the energies they're now reaching in the LHC are indeed sufficient to find supersymmetric particle according to the mainstream versions of string theory, there are other versions which predict higher energies - energies which are outside the LHC's range. ""Of course,"" she added, ""the mainstream version is the one that contains the original motivation for supersymmetry. If they retreat to one of the other versions, then most of the rationale disappears. But people have a lot riding on string theory.""""That's terrible!"" I said indignantly. She just shrugged her shoulders. __________________________________[Update, May 2015]Browsing the physics section at the South Australian State Library earlier this week, I picked up a copy of Becker, Becker and Schwarz's 
String Theory and M-Theory
 (2007). The introduction says clearly that supersymmetry is essential to string theory/M-theory, and moreover that the LHC should be able to reach high enough energies to produce supersymmetric particles, if they do in fact exist. Consulting Google Scholar, my impression is that the book is highly respected: I see 661 citations.Eight years later, no supersymmetric particles have been observed. But no doubt string theorists have an explanation for this inconvenient fact.__________________________________[Update, Dec 2015]Hey, if you think I'm being mean to those poor string theorists, just look at what Randall Munroe said the other day!__________________________________[Update, August 2017]It struck me today that the people who are criticising CERN for spending so much money finding the Higgs boson are wrong on at least two counts. First, $13B isn't actually such a large price tag for making a fundamental discovery about the laws of the universe, the truth of which is obvious only in retrospect; many physicists were unsure that the Higgs existed. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, there's the dog that didn't bark in the night. Many physicists were also expecting to find supersymmetric particles, but none have been detected. This greatly weakens the plausibility of string theory and shifts attention to competing theories for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity, of which by far the most attractive is Loop Quantum Gravity.Speaking as someone who used to work for NASA and was involved with the International Space Station project ($150B and counting), I would say CERN has given the taxpayer value for money and then some. It's a pity that all research funding isn't allocated in such a responsible manner.__________________________________[Update, March 2018]On pages 368-9 of Leonard Susskind's 2008 book The Black Hole War, I find the following passage:... there is a whole collection of particles whose existence is only conjectural, but a lot of physicists (including me) think they may exist*. For reasons that are not important to us here, these hypothetical particles are called superpartners.* We will know within a few years, when the European accelerator called the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) starts operating.Well, there it is again. Susskind, one of the foremost proponents of string theory and a world-renowned expert on fundamental physics in general, said ten years ago that the LHC would soon find the superpartners/supersymmetric particles if they were there. It hasn't found them. Ergo...","عندما سقطت التفاحة التوراتية سقطنا معها إلى هذا العالم و من ثم أصبح لزاما علينا أن نفهمه أو على الأقل نفهم كيف نعيش فيه. و عندما سقطت تفاحة نيوتن ظن العلماء أننا فهمنا أخيرا برغم مقولة نيوتن بأنه كشخص يلعب بالأصداف على شاطئ المحيط بدون أن يجرؤ حتى على النزول و معرفة ما فيه ناهيك عما وراءه.فسر القانون العام للجاذبية حركة الكون و وضع لنا أول تصور غير اسطورى أو دينى للعالم من حولنا و ظل صالحا لكل الأحوال ما يربو على الثلاثة قرون إلى أن جاء اينشتين و لكن هذه المرة بدون تفاح بنظرية يصعب تذوقها و هضمها اضافت الزمان إلى المكان و اصبح لدينا أربعة أبعاد سماها الزمكان في نظرية النسبية الشهيرة التي أعادت بلورة تصورنا للكون الكبير.في ذلك الوقت قادت الصدفة ألمانى أخر هو ماكس بلانك إلى اكتشاف نظرية الكم التي تكون النظرية النسبية بجوارها سهلة لا غموض فيها فقد قال علماء الفيزياء ان من يقول لك أنه يفهم نظرية الكم بصورة كاملة فلا تصدقه.عند ذلك عكف اينشتين على الوصول إلى نظرية كبرى تشرح كل القوى الموجودة في الطبيعة بنظرية واحدة شاملة و لكن لماذا؟ببساطة كانت النسبية تتعامل مع الجاذبية و حركة الأجرام السماوية و الأجسام الضخمة المتباعدة بكفاءة عالية جدا بصورة لا تقبل الشك بينما تنهار تماما عند دراسة بنية الذرة و الأجسام الدقيقة و بالعكس منها نظرية الكم التي تنجح بامتياز عند دراسة الذرة و تفشل في تفسير حركة الأجسام الضخمة المتباعدة.وجد علماء الفيزياء أنفسهم أمام نظريتان كلاهما صحيح في مجاله خاطئ في الناحية الأخرى و من هنا بدأ الجهاد الأعظم في تاريخ الفيزياء و الذى مات اينشتين قبل ان يتوصل فيه لأى نتيجة.يتكون هذا الكون من عناصر كالمعادن و الغازات و غيرها و يتكون كل منها من ذرات و تتكون الذرة من نواة و الكترونات و تتكون نواة الذرة من بروتونات و نيوترونات و تتكون كل منهما من كواركات.إذا فما لدينا هو الكترونات و كواركات و بعض الجسيمات الأخرى متناهية الصغر مختلفة الوظائف كالفوتونات و الميزونات و البوزيترونات و الأجسام المضادة و غيرها من المسميات الفيزيائية لجسيمات لم يرها أحد و انما رأينا تأثيرها و أمكننا هذه من دراسة سلوكها و صفاتها.نظرية الأوتار توصلت في النهاية إلى أن كل تلك الجسيمات تتكون من شيء واحد هو الوتر أو الخيط و هو شيء أشبه بالحلقات المطاطية التي نستخدمها في حزم النقود و يكون مغلق الطرفين أو مفتوحهما و تبعا لتذبذب كل وتر يتحدد طوله الموجى و سعته الموجية و بالتالى طاقته و كتلته فيصير هذا الكترون و هذا كوارك و هذا جرافيتون و ذلك ميزون و هكذا.إذاً حولت النظرية العالم لسيمفونية من العزف الجماعى لترليونات الترليونات من الأوتار في كل سنتيمتر من الكون و لم تكتف بذلك بل أضافت إلى الأبعاد المعروفة سبعة أبعاد جديدة ليصبح لدينا إحدى عشر بعدا منها بعد زمنى واحد و عشرة أبعاد للمكان.فسرت نظرية الأوتار حركة الأجسام سواء كانت متناهية الصغر متقاربة جدا كالكواركات و الفوتونات أو ضخمة جدا متباعدة كالمجرات.كل الشواهد تؤكد صحة النظرية و لكن من الناحية الرياضياتية أما من الناحية العملية فلم يتأكد نجاها إلا منذ حوالى سبعة سنوات عندما حصل أحد العلماء على جائزة نوبل في الفيزياء بعد رصده للجرافيتون الذى تنبأت النظرية بخواصه بدقة قبل ذلك بسنوات. أما حين صدور الكتاب فلم تكن النظرية قد تأكدت بعد.طالت المراجعة و وصلت لحد الملل و ما زال في الكتاب الكثير و الكثير و كذلك في الفيلم الوثائقى بأجزاءه الثلاثة الذى سيسهل عليك هضم الكثير مما ذكر في هذا الكتاب القيم.سأكتفى بهذا القدر لأترككم مع الوثائقى و الكتاب في تلك الرحلة الممتعة. نقطة أخيرة:هل نظرية الأوتار دليل على وجود خالق أم دليل على عدم وجوده؟في الحقيقة لا نظرية الأوتار و لا غيرها لهم علاقة بالتدليل على وجود الخالق من عدمه فهى قضية ايمانية لا تخضع أصلا لسلطان العقل و لا علاقة لها بال��لم أو الفلسفة و انما هي محض ايمان و تسليم قلبى روحى و لنفصل دائما بين طريق العلم و طريق الدين ان كنا نبغى التقدم في المسارين و الا فإن أحدهما سيلتهم الأخر و في النهاية ستكون أنت الخاسر.على الهامش: الضوء ليس له عمر فالوقت لا يمر عند الوصول إلى سرعة الضوء فالفوتون الذى انطلق في الإنفجار الكبير عمره هو

الكمات تتضمن وسائل راديكالية جديدة لإدراك الواقع. و اختفى مفهوم الحقيقة المطلقة و يا أبيض يا اسود اللون الرمادى ده انا محبوش و فجأة أصبح كل شيء رماديا.و يبدو الأمر و كأن الفوتون ليس هو الناقل للقوة بذاته و لكنه ينقل رسالة إلى المتلقى عن الكيفية التي عليه أن يتجاوب بها مع القوى المؤثرة فالبنسبة للجسيمات متشابهة الشحنة فإن الفوتون يحمل رسالة ""تفرقو"" و بالنسبة للجسيمات مختلفة الشحنة فإنه يحمل رسالة ""تجمعوا""أحيانا أتصور أن الكون كله خاضع لشفرة موحدة هي أون أوف أو واحد صفر تفرقوا تجمعوا شيء واحد و عكسه. شفرة بسيطة و لكنها تطغى على كل شيء بداية من القوى الطبيعية و حتى لغات البرمجة الحديثة حتى التقسيمة الرئيسية للموجودات تحصرها بين المادة و الطاقة و كل منهما قابل للتحول للآخر و من االموت تأتى الحياة و من العدم أتى الوجود من قبل بسر كلمة كن.الطول الموجى و السعة الموجية يحددان كتلة الجسيم

Not sure.Do I understand M theory? A little bit but don't ask for any algebraic reasoning.Do I know exactly what a Calabi-Yau is? Not really but I think they look a little like the hair balls from my cat.This is the second time I've equated quantum physics and all its detours to a hair-ball. That's because I can study a hair ball and still have no idea what it is for and why they exist. String Theory and the elusive TOE is in the same category. I could go on my entire life not knowing about them but now that I do, I need to know why. Newton, Einstein, Feynman, Hawking, and my cat can't all be right. Or can they?That is essentially the dilemma of string theory and the book. Greene does a great job of putting everything in layman's term but there is a point which he must exceed the intellectual ionosphere and soar into the incalculable. I really like this type of book. The challenge is the fun. But rest assured when the scientists get their act together and write an Idiot's guide to The Unified Theory Of Everything, I'll be the first in line.P. S. Hair balls and string theories have something else in common. Once you tore one apart, you can never get your hands clean."
The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,"Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan",4.29,"I sit before my computer, typing out a review of what is my favorite book. I’m daunted by the magnitude of this task, having just finished the book for the fourth or maybe fifth time. I wish I could remember when I bought this book, likely close to a decade ago, but I’m sure that I must have been awestruck to discover a book written by a man who has influenced my life and my interests to such a great extent.One of the great memories of my early life was that of waiting to plop down in front of the TV set for a few Sunday nights in 1980, as our PBS station aired a thirteen-part series called Cosmos. Accompanied at the TV by my mom and grandmother, Cosmos captured my imagination in ways that will last my whole life. It was a series not merely discussing outer space, but in fact, it addressed the history of humanity’s understanding of our place in the world, the universe, and in life. Why is the memory of a TV show so incredibly dear to me? I could say that the show opened my mind to concepts and philosophies and possibilities that I never imagined, and that’d be a fair and true statement. What really makes the series so pivotal in my life, though, is that I shared such a formative experience with my mom and my grandmother; two people to whom I owe my life, my intelligence, and, hopefully without too much hyperbole, my essential spirit. At the age of nine, it’s not very likely to imagine that I would have planted myself in front of a television tuned to PBS on a Sunday evening, but the patient guidance and love of my mom and grandmother gave me the gift of knowledge and wonder.Needless to say, I’ve always been partial to the works of Dr. Carl Sagan. Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark is the first work of Dr. Sagan’s that I’ve read as an adult and in the many years I’ve owned this book, I’ve read it at least four times. Why re-read a book so often? The answer is found in my reverence of the book’s message, its point, and its passion. Not only have I read it often, but I have made an irregularly observed tradition to start each new year with a fresh reading. At least three times, I’ve picked the book up within hours of watching the ball drop in Times Square, heralding in the new year.Many who know me, already know this is my favorite book, but I’m deeply challenged when I’m asked what the book is about, and several paragraphs into my review, I’m probably overdue in attempting to answer this exact question. In this book, Dr. Carl Sagan tackles one of the key problems facing our time, as well as repeated throughout the history of our civilization, and that is the propensity for humanity to delve into our darkest superstitions and most bleak behaviors when our knowledge or ego is challenged. It seems that throughout the history of our species, we’ve turned our backs on critical thought and skepticism at times when those with claims to power and zealotry and wealth have found it advantageous and profitable to subvert the masses. Why discuss witch burnings and crop circles and claims of government coverups of alien abductions from 50 years ago? The answer lies in the here and now. At a time when every facet of our daily lives revolves around technology; when each and every human being lives under the threat of annihilation by nuclear weapons; when communications are global but subject to being monitored in violation of the founding documents of our nation (granted this is a problem that would occur years after Sagan’s death, yet it’s exactly the type of behavior Sagan speaks of), we find that critical thought wanes in the population of our own nation, not to mention that of the entire world. Credulity and old habits creep into our consciousness. Our world, our freedoms, and our lives come under attack.Go to the movies and watch ghosts haunt a house or watch the undead torment campers in the woods. Turn on the TV, and you’re likely to find tales of alien spacecraft being hidden by the government. You’re equally likely to channel surf past a shopping network selling new age crystals. But where on broadcast television are you likely to find a substantive debate on issues of education or technology? Where do you see educational programming talking about the technology that engulfs our very lives? As Sagan points out, imagine the irony that kids can watch a cartoon about a prehistoric family with a dinosaur for a pet (I actually protest... I enjoyed the Flintstones!), but may never have the opportunity to watch a show about the invention or technology of television, itself!At what cost to our freedoms, will we accept great claims without great proof? What decisions do we as a world culture need to make to grow and prosper and what can we learn from our history, replete with credulity and domination and fear-mongering?Should we shrink from the challenges of education and critical thinking, what price will we pay? Will it be our personal or national economic stability? Will we see our freedoms curtailed (as if we haven’t witnessed that already)? Or will we pay with the extinction of our species? The thesis of this book, as I understand it, is that we, as a culture and society, may be repeating a common mistake of our history: accepting a diminution of our critical thinking skills at our own distinct peril. Because of the threats we face though, this time we stand at these crossroads at possibly the least opportune of times. Throughout history, those in power or those who seek it, have abused our fears and used them to control the masses to their own advantage or profit. This book begs to serve as a wake-up call to anyone willing to accept the challenge not only to read it, but to deeply ponder each of its points and positions. It offers the methods of critical thought as the grand lighthouse by which we can safely steer our course through the treacherous times and malevolent forces we face. Dr. Sagan, true to the book’s title, offers the methods of science as a candle in the darkness in men’s souls.This book occupies a special place in my life, as I’ve stated. I believe that this is a book of such enormous importance, that it should be required reading in every senior-level high school class in the country. It may not be comfortable reading, and Dr. Sagan wrote on such an astronomically high reading level (forgive the pun, as Dr. Sagan was, of course, a world-renown astronomer) that it may take weeks or months to fully drink in the material, but the discussion that Dr. Sagan presented is vital. The arguments he presents are vital to our intellect, our freedom, and our humanity.For making me think and contemplate, reading after reading, this book scores five stars.","Always insightful, it seems that Sagan just wanted to watch the world learn. I should've read this at 14. Honestly, this should probably be required high school reading for everyone. It illustrates clearly the many and varied personal and societal benefits gained from applying the methods of science to every corner of our thinking. The methods are the important part, the findings are just icing on the cake. It covers the dangers of unchecked ideologies and the requirement for both objectivity and wonder. Almost no topic is left unexamined. I really can't recommend this book enough.","المراجعة عصية على التلخيص بنفس قدر أهمية الكتاب للمهتمين بالعلوم **""المنهج العلمي على ما يبدو عليه من الغلظة والسماجة لهو أهم إلى حد بعيد من مكتشفات العلم.""
ذُهلت عندما وجدت الكاتب يَسْتَهِل الكتاب بالحديث بجدية لتفنيد مزاعم الأطباق الطائرة؛ فالكاتب -أي كارل ساجان- هو أحد أشهر العلماء في التاريخ, ليس فقط لإنجازاته العلمية, بل لدوره الأدبي في نشر العلم للعامة, حيث يعد أكبر نقطة تحول حدثت في هذا المجال, وبأسلوبه الأدبي الشيق استطاع أن يسجل رقم قياسي كأعلى نسبة مشاهدة في التاريخ لعرض تلفزيوني عن برنامج (Cosmos 1980) حيث جمع أكثر من 500 مليون مشاهد عبر 60 دولة, كما أن هذا الكتاب هو آخر أعماله حيث كتبه في أيامه الأخيرة وهو يكابد آلام السرطان وينتظر نهايته المحتومة, ثم رحل عنا بعد سنة واحدة فقط من نشر الكتاب أي عام 1996فهل من المعقول الحديث عن الفضائيين والأطباق الطائرة, كرسالة أخيرة منه وتحذيراً للبشر, كما يوضح العنوان؟!""كارل ساجان. من مقابلة في آخر سنة قبل وفاته""**""لا يجب أن نصدق الكثيرين الذين يقولون إن الأحرار فقط هم الذين يجب أن يتعلموا, وإنما, بدلا من ذلك, يجب أن نصدق الفلاسفة الذين يقولون إن المتعلمين هم وحدهم الأحرار"" إبيكتيتوس, فيلسوف روماني وعبد سابق.
كان فريدريك بيلي عبداً. وحين كان صبياً في ميريلاند في العشرينيات من القرن التاسع عشر, لم يكن لديه أب أو أم يعنيان به (وقد كانت عادة شائعة أن يعزل الأطفال عن أمهاتهم قبل أن يبلغ الطفل شهره الثاني عشر) وكان واحداً من ملايين لا حصر لها من الأطفال العبيد الذين لم تكن لهم أي تطلعات واقعية في حياة مليئة بالأمللقد تأثر بيلي-إلى الأبد- بما رآه وما مر به من تجارب وهو يكبر :""لكم أوقظت في الفجر كل يوم على دَوِيّ صرخات تُمزق نياط القلب صادرة عن إحدى عماتي, والتي اعتاد رئيس العمال أن يقيدها إلى عارضة الأرضية ويضرب ظهرها العاري بالسياط حتى يغمرها الدم بما في الكلمة من معنى حرفي.. وكان منذ سطوع الشمس حتى غروبها يسب ويلعن ويمزق جلد عبيد الحقل.. ويبدو أنه كان يتلذذ بهمجيته الجهنمية""وكانت العبيد تترد على مسامعهم باستمرار -من المزارع الكبرى ومنابر الكنائس ومن دور القضاء ومقار الحكم على حد سواء- فكرة أن العبيد صنف دوني بمقتضى الوراثة, وأن الله حكم عليهم بالبؤس, وبهذه الطرق حافظت هذه ""المؤسسة الفريدة"" على بقائها رغم ما تتسم به من طبيعة بشعةوكانت هناك قاعدة تكشف بجلاء عن الكثير: لابد أن يظل العبيد أميين, ففي الجنوب في فترة ما قبل الحرب الأهلية الأمريكية كان البيض الذين يعلّمون عبداً القراءة يلقون عقاباً شديداً. وكتب بيلي فيما بعد: ""إنك إذا أردت أن تجعل عبداً راضياً, من الضروري أن تجعله عديم التفكير. إذ من الضروري أن تجعل رؤيته الأخلاقية والعقلية مظلمة, وأن تفني قوة التفكير لديه قدر المستطاع"", لذا كان لازماً على مُلاّك العبيد أن يراقبوا ما يسمعه العبيد ويرونه أو يفكرون فيه. وهذا هو السبب الذي من أجله تعد القراءة والتفكير النقدي أموراً خطرةً, بل انقلابية, في المجتمع المظلمبعدها في عام 1828 افترق بيلي عن باقي عائلته الكبيرة المتهرئة, بِيع ونُقل إلى منزل مجهول في مدينة بالتيمور الغربية. لقد أرسل بيل للعمل عند الكابتن ""هيو آولد"" وزوجته ""صوفيا"", وبذلك انتقل من المزرعة الكبيرة إلى الخدمة المنزلية. في هذه البيئة الجديدة كان يلتقي, في كل يوم, بالمعرفة والأدب وبالكتب وبأناس يستطيعون القراءة. فاكتشف ما أسماه لغز القراءة: ""هناك صلة بين الأحرف المكتوبة على الصفحة وحركة شفاه القارئ, ثمة تلازم/ارتباط بنسبة واحد لواحد بين النقوش السوداء والأصوات المنطوقة"", فاخذ يدرس خلسة من ""كتاب ويستر لتعليم الهجاء"" الخاص بالصغير ""تومي آولد"". فحفظ الحروف الأبجدية, وحاول أن يفهم الأصوات التي ترمز لها, وفي نهاية المطاف طلب من صوفيا آولد أن تساعده على التعلم. فوافقت, متأثرة بذكاء الصبي وإخلاصه وربما أيضا جهلاً منها بالمحظوراتوحين جاء الوقت الذي كان فيه بيلي يتهجى كلمات من ثلاثة أو أربعة حروف اكتشف الكابتن آولد ما كان يجري. وبعد أن استشاط غضباً أمر صوفيا بالتوقف عن تعليم فريدريك. وشرح في حضور فريدريك الأمر قائلاً:""لا يجب أن يعلّم الزنجي سوى طاعة سيده وأن يعمل ما يؤمر به, أما التعلم فيفسد خير زنوج العالم. والآن إذا ما علّمت هذا الزنجي كيف يقرأ فلن يكون هناك معنى للاحتفاظ به فلن يلائمه للأبد أن يكون عبداً""
لقد وبخ آولد صوفيا بهذه الطريقة وكأن بيلي لم يكن موجوداً في الحجرة معهم مطلقاً, أو كأنه لوح من الخشب الأصم.غير أن آولد كشف لبيلي عن السر العظيم: ""لقد فهمت الآن.. قوة الرجل الأبيض التي تمكنه من استعباد الرجل الأسود, من تلك اللحظة فهمت السبيل المؤدي من الرق إلى الحرية""ووجد فريدريك طرقاً لمواصلة تعلّم كيفية القراءة دون المزيد من العون من صوفيا آولد التي أضحت الآن مرتعدة ومتحفظة, وكانت طرقه تشمل حتى إكراه أطفال المدارس البيض في الشوارع .ثم بدأ يعلِّم أقرانه من العبيدوهرب إلى نيو انجلند حيث كان الرق محظوراً بمقتضى القانون وحيث كان السود أحراراً وغير اسمه إلى فريدريك دوجلاس؛ ليراوغ الصائدين الذين كانوا يقتفون أثر العبيد الهاربين سعيا وراء المكافئات, و��صبح أحد أعظم الخطباء والكتاب والزعماء السياسيين في التاريخ الأمريكي, وكان على مدة حياته كلها يدرك أن الخلاص يكمن في محو الأميةبعد أن هرب وهو في العشرين من عمره ببضع سنين, انضم لجماعة الكويكر, وأدهشهم بمدى بلاغته كخطيب زنجي, ولم يكن ذلك معروفاً لديهم أبداً. لقد حطّم مظهره وسلوكه الأسطورة السائدة آنذاك عن ""الخنوع الطبيعي"" لدي الأمريكيين الأفارقةولم يعد إلى العبودية أبداً وبدلاً من ذلك قضى حياته يناضل من أجل حقوق الإنسان, باعتباره مؤلفاً ومحرراً وناشراً للصحف ومتحدثاً في أمريكا وفي خارجها, وباعتباره أول أمريكي أفريقي يحتل منصباً استشارياً للرئيس لنكولن ونجح دوجلاس في الدفاع عن تسليح العبيد السابقين من أجل الشماللقد كانت كثيراً من أرائه لاذعاً, وغير مصاغ جيداً على نحو يكسبه أصدقاء من ذوي المراكز الرفيعة, وكان صريحاً في معارضته لسياسة إبادة الأمريكيين الأصليين, وفي مؤتمر شلالات سينيكا عام 1848, حين واتت ""اليزابيث كادي ستانتون"" الشجاعة لتنادي بكفالة حق التصويت للمرأة, كان دوجلاس الرجل الوحيد من أية جماعة عرقية الذي يقف مؤيداً لهذا النداء!**وكان الطغاة والحكام المطلقون يدركون دائماً أن معرفة القراءة والكتابة والتعلم والكتب والصحف تحمل الخطر في طياتها, لأنها يمكن أن تصب أفكاراً استقلالية بل ومتمردة في عقول رعاياهم, فقد كتب الحاكم الملكي البريطاني لمستعمرة فيرجينيا عام 1671 ما يلي: ""أشكر الرب على عدم وجود مدارس مجانية ولا طباعة وأتمنى ألا يكون لدينا (منها) في المائة سنة (التالية)؛ لأن التعلم جلب العصيان والمروق عن الدين والطائفية إلى العالم, وأفشت الطباعة سر هذه الأشياء وارتكبت جريمة التشهير في حق خير الحكومات, فليحفظنا الرب من كليها!"" **حسنا لقد تم محاربة التعلم سابقاً, ولكن ماذا عن الآن وما علاقة هذا بالأطباق الطائرة والفضائيين؟!إن 2% من الأمريكيين أي حوالي 5 مليون شخص يدّعون أنهم اختطفوا من قبل الفضائيين الذين فحصوهم على أطباقهم الطائرة, وحوالي نصف الشعب الأمريكي يصدقهم! فقام ساجان بتتبع هذا الأمر في الكتاب, وخصوصاً أنه كان قبلاً أحد أعضاء اللجنة المكلفة من الدفاع الجوي لتفحص أمر الأطباق الطائرةلقد بدأ الأمر عندما وصف أحد الطيارين منظر إحدى القوارب في مياه هائجة حتى إنها كانت ستطير عن المياه, فحورت الصحافة الخبر على لسانه بأنه رأى قارب طائر وبعد مدة, سقطت طائرة, وهي طائرة تجسس غالباً, وعندما قام ضباط الجيش بمنع تصويرها ربطوا هذا بالخبر السابق سرده, بأن الحكومة وجدت أطباق طائرة واحتفظت بفضائيين وأنها تتكتم على الأمرثم بدأت دوائر المحاصيل التي نُسبت للفضائيين, والتي بدأ بافتعالها مواطنان من بريطانيا باستخدام خشبة وحبل كمزحة في أول الأمر بعد أن بدأت إشاعة الأطباق الطائرة. وعلى مدار 20 سنة كانوا يبذلون المزيد من الجهد والابتكار في أشكالهم, فعندما كان يخرج أحد العلماء ليحاول تفسير الأمر بطريقة طبيعية مثل البرق الكروي أو العواصف وتيارات الهواء, يعمدون في المرة التالية لإحداث شكل يشذ عن قاعدة هذا التبرير العلمي, وخلال هذه الفترة قام العديدين في أنحاء العالم بمحاكاة لهذه الرسومات ليحصلوا على التغطية الإعلامية, ولكن بطلانا قررا أن ينهيا مغامراتهما مع الفضائيين ويفصحوا عن خدعتهما قبل أن يسرقهم الوقت وينتهي احتفال الإعلام بهذه الظواهر ويفقدوا الفرصة لإبهار العالمبعد حادثة المحاصيل خرج الأمر عن السيطرة, واختطف أناس وكتب مسلسل عن اختطافهم, ونشرت كتب وأذيعت برامج تدافع عن وجود الفضائيين, حتى صدق نصف الشعب هذه القصةولكن الأمر لم ينتهي مع كشف سر المحاصيل!""صورة لإحدى دوائر المحاصيل""فمازال هناك أعداد هائلة من الأشخاص الذين يقسمون بأنهم قد اختطفوا حقاً على أيدي الفضائيين, وإذا تتبعنا حالات النصب وادعاء الخطف لنيل الشهرة, ننتهي إلى وجود عدد ضخم-وإن كان أقل من السابق- مصرون على إدعائاتهملقد أراد ساجان أن يعاملهم بمنتهى المنطق, والحنو, فهو وإن كان يراهم مخطئين, ولكن انفعالاتهم عن قصصهم حقيقة, وهو لا يريد أن يفند الأدلة فقط دون إظهار الشفقة على هؤلاء الضحايا أو مراعاة الضعف البشري والنفوس الضعيفة كما يحلو لجيمس راندي أن يتعامل مع هذه الأمور دائماًفأكمل ساجان حديثه عن الحالات النفسية التي من الممكن أن تتسبب في هذه الخبرة عن الخطف والتي تبدو حقيقية جداً لهؤلاء المخطوفين وعرض نتائج البحوث التي جمعها موثقة بعدد كبير من الحالات. ومنها أنه يمكنك بالإيحاء أن تزرع فكرة في عقلك فتبدو لك وكأنها حقيقيةقد تستعيد من لاوعيك أشياء قديمة, لا تتذكر متى رأيتها, فتتهم الشيطان كما يقول هرمان ميلفل, وقد يحدث لك هلوسات كما كان يحدث في قصص الشياطين التي كانت تنكح النساء قديماً وحديثاً, كما أن كبت حدوث اغتصاب جنسي قديماً قد يؤدي إلى حلول الكائنات الفضائية محل المغتصب في اللاوعي وهناك في الطفولة المبكرة تعد الأحلام شيئا حقيقياً, وقد يستمر هذا لدى البعض عندما يكبرونقد تبدو هذه الأشياء خيالية قليلاً لك, ولكن عندما تقرأ سردها كاملة في الكتاب ستتغير ولاشك نظرتك لمدى ضعف النفس البشريةكان ساجان يكتب الكتاب كفصول, وعندما ينهي فصل, يقوم بتلخيصه ونشره في إحدى الصحف الكبيرة, خشية أن يموت في أية لحظة لمرضه العضال. وبعد انتهى من الأطباق الطائرة, حاول تحذيرنا من المخاطر الأخرى التي تحيط بعالمنا:إن أكثر من أربعين مليون من البالغين الأمريكيين يلم بالكاد بالقراءة والكتابة, حسب مسح أجرى على المستوى القومي جرى بطلب وزارة التربية والتعليم!- إن الاستطلاعات تبين أن 95% من المحبين للعلم هم من الأميين علمياً, وهي تقريباً النسبة نفسها بين الأمريكيين الأفارقة –وجميعهم تقريباً من العبيد- الذين يعانون الأمية قبل الحرب الأهلية مباشرة!! - في أوائل الثمانينيات, في أمريكا ثلثي الكبار لم تكن لديهم أية فكرة عن ""طريق المعلومات فائق السرعة"", ولم يعلم 43% أين تقع اليابان؟ وكان 38% يجهلون مصطلح ""الهولوكوست"", غير أن النسبة ارتفعت إلى 99% عند معرفة شائعة تحرش مايكل جاكسون بطفل, وإلى أعالي التسعينيات فيما يتعلق بمن سمعوا عن أحداث المسلسلات المتلفزة!- إشاعات عن أن ""ناسا"" اكتشفت أصوات من ثقب أسود تمجد الله في الأعالي !!- أكثر من ربع الأمريكيين حسب استطلاعات الرأي يؤمنون بالتنجيم, وثلثهم يعتقد أنه يقوم على أسس علمية. وربما فاق عدد المنجمين في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية عدد علماء الفلك بعشر مرات وفي فرنسا هناك منجمون أكثر من رجال الدين التابعين للكنيسة الرومانية الكاثوليكية!- انتشار الترويج للصوفية (الصوفية هو وجود معرفة تنزل على أشخاص محددين بطريقة سحرية, وتكون هذه المعرفة أرقى من العلوم المادية)!- انتشار الباراسيكولوجي (قدرات عقلية خارقة مثل ثني المعادن وحملها في الهواء, زي الأطفال اللي عند العرافة في فيلم ماتريكس)!- 10% من سكان أمريكا قد رأوا شبحا من قبل!- أمريكيون من مختلف الفئات يجزمون أنهم تواصلوا مع شبح الرئيس الراحل جون كينيدي, حتى أن دائرة معارف الديانات الأمريكية تعده ضمن الديانات, حيث أنهم يعاملونه كإله حتى بعد موته!- الأمريكيون سيئو السمعة في العلوم!وعند التقصي وراء النقطة الأخيرة, وجد أنه ليس العلوم فقط, وإنما العلماء أيضاً. فدرجاتك العالية قد تلصق بك تهمة ""دحيح"", فيبتعد عنك زملائك, الذين قد ينظرون إليك كغريب أطوار قد يلبس يوما الحزام عند نهاية فقرات صدره, ويضع نظارات سميكة وفي جيب قميصه يضع تشكيلة واسعة من الأقلام, وعلى وسطه حزام آخر مثبت به آلة حاسبة علميةقد يكون هذا شكل محب العلوم, وقد يكون صاحب هذا الشكل اضطر ليتعرف على المزيد من العلوم, فهي لا تطلب منك أن تكون اجتماعيا ولا كثيراً من مقابلة الناس ومحاولات مضنية لكسب ثقتهمولكن على أي حال لا يجوز تجنب معاملتهم هكذا, فمثلا لقد كان ماكسويل طفلا شديد الوسامة من أسرة ثرية وكان لديه حب الاستطلاع, رغم أنه لم يكن يهتم كثيراً بهندامه, فسبب له أقرانه معاناة شديدة, حتى أنه أنشد هذه الأبيات:""أيتها السنون توالي, وأسرعي بالوقت الموعود ..حين يضحي جَلْد الصِبية بين الجرائم معدود ..

كما ويميل الأولاد إلى اضطهاد المتفوقين منهم حتى لا يظهروا بمظهر سيء مقارنة بهم, ولكن هذا لن يجعل عالمنا مكاناً أفضل**يقول فرانسيس بيكون أن الإنسان	يؤمن إيماناً وثيقاً بما يعتقد أنه صادقولكن كيف نتأكد من أن أمر ما صادق حتى لا نكون مثل ضحايا الأطباق الطائرة؟يستشهد ساجان بقاعدة على لسان شارلوك هولمز وهي أنه من الأخطاء الكبرى أن يقوم المرء بالتنظير قبل أن تكتمل المعطياتثم يسرد لنا مثالا لتطبيق هذه القاعدة,:""""يعيش في جراجي تنين ينفث النار"", لنفترض أنني أقول لك هذا القول المؤكد بشكل جاد, فمن المؤكد أنك سوف تود أن تتحقق من ذلك, وأن ترى بنفسك, إذ كانت هناك على مر العصور قصص لا تحصى عن التنين, دون أن يوجد دليل واقعي واحد عليها. يا لها من فرصة! تقول ""أرني"" فأقودك إلى الجراج, تنظر إلى الداخل, فترى سلماً, وعلبة دهان فارغة, وتريسكل, ولكن لا تنين هناك. فتسألني ""أين التنين"" فأجيب ""ياه! إنه هنا"" وأنا ألوح بيدي بشكل غامض.وأتابع القول:""لقد فاتني أن أذكر لك أنه تنين خفي"". فتقترح أنت أن ننثر الدقيق كي نمسك بآثار أقدام التنين. فأرد قائلاً: ""هذه فكرة جيدة. غير أن هذا التنين يسبح في الهواء""إذن سوف تستخدم جهاز تحسس يعمل بالأشعة تحت الحمراء كي تتبين النار الخفية ""فكر جيدة, لكن النار الخفية غير حامية أيضاً""إذن سوف ترش رذاذ الدهان على التنين كي تجعله مرئياً""فكرة جيدة. لولا أن تنين غير مادي أو مجسّد, ولن يلتصق به الدهان""وهكذا أرد على كل اختبار فيزيائي تقترحه بشرح خاص للسبب الذي يجعل هذا الاختبار غير صالحوالآن, ما الفرق بين تنين طافٍ خفي غير مادي, ينفث ناراً غير حامية أو عدم وجود تنين أصلاً؟فكل ما أطلب منك أن تفعله هو التصديق في غياب الدليل. لمجرد أني أقول لك ما أقولوإذا جئتك بعدها بأسبوع لأخبرك بأنه يوجد أثار للدقيق, أو جئتك بأصبع محروق, كدليل على صدقي, ألا يمكنك أن تشك في أن تكون تلك الأدلة قد زيفت, بما إنه من السهل تزييفها؟""
ولهذا تأتي فائدة منهج الشك العلمي, فيجب أن يطبق في كل شيء بطريقة معتدلة ففي العلم نمنح أسمى جوائزنا لأولئك الذين يثبتون خطأ المعتقدات المستقرة بشكل مقنعفالشك يحرر الفكر والأوطان لذا فالديمقراطية والمجتمع المفتوح هم آمالنا, وكما تقول حكمة لاتينية:""حيث يوجد الشك يوجد الحرية""
وكان يأمل توماس جيفرسون أن يكون قسم المواطنة الذي يقسمه المهاجرون الجدد والتعهد الذي يتلوه الطلبة بشكل روتيني كالتالي:""أعد بالتساؤل حول كل ما يقوله لي قادتي وزعمائي, وأعد باستخدام ملكتي النقدية, وأعد بتنمية استقلالي الفكري, وأعد بأن أعلم نفسي حتى أتخذ أحكامي وتقديراتي الخاصة"" وقد عبر جيفرسون بما قد نادى به جون ستيوارت مل ولكن بطريقة أبلغ: ""لو أن أمة ما توقعت أن تكون ""جاهلة"" و""حرة"" في حالة حضارية معا, فهي تتوقع ما لم يكن قط, ولن يكون أبداً""
وعلى هذا النحو ننتهي إلى ما قاله قاضي المحكمة العليا بالولايات المتحدة روبرت هـ جاكسون 1950 ""ليست وظيفة حكومتنا حماية المواطن من الوقوع في الخطأ؛ وإنما وظيفة المواطن حماية الحكومة من الوقوع في الخطأ"" **كما أن ساجان يحاول معالجة نفور العامة من العلمفالدجلنة تخاطب الحاجات العاطفية القوية التي غالباً ما يدعها العلم دون إشباعوفي صميم بعض أنماط الدجلنة تكمن فكرة أن تمنى الشيء يحققه, فكم يكون مقدار ما يمكن أن نشعر به من الرضي, إذا حققنا الرغبات التي نتمناها من صميم فؤادنا بمجرد التمني, يا لها من فكرة تغوي النفوس, خاصة إذا ما قورنت بالعمل الشاق وحسن الحظ الذي نحتاج إليه عادة كي نحقق آمالنا.

والمعنى الآخر عندما تكون كلمة ديمون بمعنى المعرفة, فيصبح العنوان ""عالم تطارده المعرفة"" ويمثل محاولات الجانب الآخر لنشر التفكير العلمي, ومنها:- ""ما من شيء يستحق رعايتنا أفضل من ترقية العلم والأدب, فالمعرفة في كل البلاد القاعدة الأكثر ضماناً لسعادة الجمهور"" جورج واشنطون من خطابه أمام الكونجرس بتاريخ 8 يناير 1790 - الآباء المؤسسين لأمريكا ودستورهم ووثيقة حقوق الإنسان- تصريح ""الدالاي لاما"" الحالي بأنه سيكون على البوذية التبتية أن تتغير إذا ما أثبت العلم أن أحد أركنها مغلوط.

Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,Mary Roach,4.06,"If you can’t cope with the idea of death without a hearty dose of euphemism – this probably isn’t going to be the book for you.When I became an archivist at the City of Melbourne a very dear friend of mine became a technician at the city Morgue. I figured at the time he had watched a couple of episodes too many of Quincy M.E. and that he would find a normal job eventually. It is probably 15 years since I stopped being an archivist – my friend still cuts up dead people for a living. A few weeks after he started work I asked him how it was all going and he replied, “Good, yeah, I can even eat spaghetti now.” Sometimes it is best not to ask.This book is a bit of a career guide for those of us who are post-life. There are a remarkable number of interesting things one can get up to after life. Many of these choices are presented in this book in an up-close-and-personal way that I particularly enjoyed. I’m a fairly robust character, but there were many moments when I made involuntary noises during this book. The swallowed fly was a case in point and by far the worst. The noise I made was loud enough and distressing enough for my daughters to ask what was the matter – they didn’t ask again.Part of my friend’s job involves removing people’s brains – this is also described in some detail here. The problem is that once the brain has been removed you can’t really pop it back from whence it came – so instead it is placed in the chest cavity. This means the head needs to be ‘packed’ and generally this is done with newspaper. One of the decisions made by those putting you back together again is which newspaper would seem most appropriate for you. (I assume in these days of obsessive Orwellian Double-Speak the corpses are called clients or customers or something equally ridiculous – although I wish it was after Waugh and they were called Loved Ones.) I really don’t mind what happens to me once I’m dead – I figure I’m going to be busy enough explaining to God why He doesn’t exist to be worried about what happens to my body – but I must admit that spending eternity with my head stuffed with a Murdoch rag does seem to be a punishment disproportionate to any crime I have committed whilst alive.","Fascinating, touching and surprisingly wholesome considering it's about dead bodies
Many people will find this book disrespectful. There is nothing amusing about being dead, they will say. Ah, but there is.
Mary Roach brings cadavers into a whole new, sometimes painfully bright, light. We follow her as she attends autopsies and medical discussions. We learn what happens to bodies as they decompose on the field, under the field and in so, so many places.
The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back.
 We get a bit of a history lesson with the sordid tales associated with body-snatching and the early medicine's need for atomically correct models. We even go so far back as ancient Egypt and their secret honey recipe (you will never look at honey in the same way) (trust me).This is one book you'd have to be
 dying
 to miss out on.
Death. It doesn't have to be boring.

Feynman (Contibutor), Ralph Leighton, Edward Hutchings (Editor)",4.27,"This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual, fun way that makes it easy to read. The problem is that the author, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Dick Feynman, is annoying. All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent, using it, delighting others (or himself if that's his real goal) and then being applauded for it (sometimes only by himself). For example, he discovers that he's a great artist, musician, safecracker, and critic. Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk. There were many times when I thought, yeah buddy, *you* think it's funny but no one else does. A few stories like this and it's quirky but piled on top of each other, it's annoying.I can't really recommend this book. Maybe mischevious self-aggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise, I suggest a pass.","This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.","Richard P. Feynman was a winner of the Nobel prize in physics. This book tells us about various escapades he had in his life. I have read a few books written by Nobel Prize winners in Physics. Most of them were written formally about the academy stuff related to Physics. I knew what I had to expect from this book. I was in for a big surprise when I started reading it. This book will give you a totally different experience. You are in for a joyride with Mr. Feynman, who discusses almost everything under the sun with ease in a brilliant humorous way.His tryst with art, Brazilian bongo, bars, gambling, dating, and many other things will keep you amazed and entertained at the same time. We will wonder how this Physicist got a handsome amount for his drawings. He was the very best in almost everything he tried in his life. 
What I learned from this book 

1) Why is it important for a Scientist to be genuine? 
Feynman tells us the importance of being genuine in Scientific circles to avoid bias and the importance of avoiding revealing only favorable data. ""The idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists...You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.”  
2) How did Japan become a developed country? 
If you are someone who read the book, To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima, you will see how terribly Japan was affected due to the world war and the atom bomb explosion in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From that situation, Japan has become a superpower. Many factors contributed to their success, like the Kaizen technique, Toyota way, minimalism, Ikigai, and Kakeibo. Feynman tells us how Japan developed at such a fast pace. ""The people of Japan believed they had only one way of moving up: to have their children educated more than they were; that it was very important for them to move out of their peasantry to become educated. So there has been a great energy in the family to encourage the children to do well in school, and to be pushed forward. Because of this tendency to learn things all the time, new ideas from the outside would spread through the educational system very easily. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Japan has advanced so rapidly.""  
3) How did Mr. Feynman become the best in whatever he tried to do in his life? 
We will be amazed at the different areas that Feynman could handle in his life. He was very successful in almost all the fields he tried to deal with. He himself is saying that it was due to his confidence that he was able to deal with multiple fields like Physics, Art, and Music in his life. “You have to have absolute confidence. Keep right on going, and nothing will happen.”  
My favourite three lines from this book 
 “I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go.”   ""You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""     ""The whole problem of discovering what was the matter, and figuring out what you have to do to fix it–that was interesting to me, like a puzzle.""  
What could have been better?
The problem with this book is that Feynman might sound narcissistic and chauvinistic in some areas of this book. Some won't like the way he described women and other fields of science like biology. His extraordinary confidence can be interpreted as grandiosity by some people. Feynman himself said that he is not a perfect person. He had his own negatives. Feynman died in February 1988. Most of the incidences discussed in this book happened in the 1950s to 1980s. We should also consider the time period in which he lived and should never try to interpret this book with the political correctness of 2022. I can't still blame a reader if they felt what I described above, as I also felt the same in some parts of this book. There are innumerable positives in this book that will cancel all the above negatives easily.
Rating 
 5/5 This book will be a good choice if you want to have a fun filled experience for sometime with a true genius.  “I wonder why. I wonder why.I wonder why I wonder.I wonder why I wonder whyI wonder why I wonder!”  —————————————————————————

Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams,Matthew Walker,4.38,"Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. Once or twice, I stayed up two nights in a row. I knew I wasn’t as sharp when I was operating mostly on caffeine and adrenaline, but I was obsessed with my work, and I felt that sleeping a lot was lazy.Now that I’ve read Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep, I realize that my all-nighters, combined with almost never getting eight hours of sleep, took a big toll. The book was recommended to me by my daughter Jenn and John Doerr. Walker, the director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Human Sleep Science, explains how neglecting sleep undercuts your creativity, problem solving, decision-making, learning, memory, heart health, brain health, mental health, emotional well-being, immune system, and even your life span. “The decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact,” Walker writes.I don’t necessarily buy into all of Walker’s reporting, such as the strong link he claims between not getting enough sleep and developing Alzheimer’s. In an effort to wake us all up to the harm of sleeping too little, he sometimes reports as fact what science has not yet clearly demonstrated. But even if you apply a mild discount factor, Why We Sleep is an important and fascinating book.Because this is a short review, I’ll answer a few questions that I suspect are top of mind for you.Does everyone really need seven or eight hours of sleep a night? The answer is that you almost certainly do, even if you’ve convinced yourself otherwise. In the words of Dr. Thomas Roth, of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, “The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without impairment, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.”Why do we sleep? After all, when you’re sleeping—and all animals do—you can’t hunt, gather, eat, reproduce, or defend yourself. Yet Walker concludes that the evolutionary upsides of sleep are far greater than these downsides. In brief, sleep produces complex neurochemical baths that improve our brains in various ways. And it “restocks the armory of our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manner of sickness.” In other words, sleep greatly enhances our evolutionary fitness—just in ways we can’t see.What can I do to improve my sleep hygiene?- Replace any LEDs bulbs in your bedroom, because they emit the most sleep-corroding blue light.- If you’re fortunate enough to be able to control the temperature where you live, set your bedroom to drop to 65 degrees at the time you intend to go to sleep. “To successfully initiate sleep … your core temperature needs to decrease by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit,” according to Walker.- Limit alcohol, because alcohol is not a sleep aid, contrary to popular belief. While it might help induce sleep, “alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM [rapid-eye-movement] sleep,” Walker says.- If you can possibly take a short midday nap like our ancestors used to and some Mediterranean and South American cultures still do, you should (but no later than 3 pm). It will likely improve your creativity and coronary health as well as extend your lifetime.It took me a little longer than usual to finish Why We Sleep—ironically, because I kept following Walker’s advice to put down the book I was reading a bit earlier than I was used to, so I could get a better night’s sleep. But Walker taught me a lot about this basic activity that every person on Earth needs. I suspect his book will do the same for you.","""The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span""
This is not a book that I had in any of my reading lists, and only picked up because the title seemed interesting while I was searching for some other books. I'm really glad that I did so, because this turned out to be one of the most incredible books I've ever read: full of enlighteningly descriptive insights on many aspects related to sleeping.
""Wakefulness is low-level brain damage, while sleep is neurological sanitation.""""When sleep is abundant, minds flourish. When it is deficient, they don’t.""
The books contains four main standalone parts, starting with explaining what sleep really is, then moving across how/ why should we sleep and dream, and finally on establishing proper sleeping habits. The reader will have the opportunity to learn about different stages of sleep and their functions with a staggering amount of examples and research references to better comprehend the principles outlined. And unlike most health related books, Walker's writing is excellent for readers of any prior background on the area. It made the reading experience very smooth and entertaining.
""REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity""""The REM-sleep dreaming brain was utterly uninterested in bland, commonsense links – the one-step-to-the-next associations. Instead, the REM-sleep brain was shortcutting the obvious links and favoring very distantly related concepts. The logic guards had left the REM-sleep dreaming brain.""
It is indeed alarming - as the author has stated throughout the book - how unaware we are about the importance of sleep to all beings. I, for one, had never even dreamed of such severe implications due to poor quality or reduced sleeping, but shared the common misconception of being wake up more is important for success in all areas in life. This book not only correct such mistaken beliefs but will cause a paradigm shift in how we should embrace proper sleeping habits, and soon.
""Humans, modern-living or pre-industrial, need less than seven hours of sleep therefore appears to be a wishful conceit, and a tabloid myth.""
I cannot emphasize enough, how important it is for every single person to read this book, and cannot thank the author enough, for this is undoubtedly one the most helpful books one can ever read. I believe everyone should read this - irrespective of any and all variables - and the only worry you will have is not having read it sooner. Read this book, and as soon as you can!
""Memories formed without sleep are weaker memories, evaporating rapidly.""","This book is genuinely terrifying. The author, a sleep scientist, lists the devastating consequences of getting less than 7-9 hours regularly and it is so much worse than you might have thought. SO much worse. We're basically all going to die. I'm not even kidding--being just an hour short on sleep a day will do serious damage to your immune system almost immediately, and the Western world is in the grip of a massive sleep deprivation epidemic. Lack of sleep is a carcinogen, literally. It also destroys your ability to control your emotions and understand those of others, your memory, your creativity; it predisposes you to eat more *and* to put on more weight; oh, and it is closely linked to ADHD for the young and Alzheimers for the old. Basically, if you go on Twitter and think ""why is everyone and everything so absolutely awful"" it's probably related to society-wide chronic sleep deprivation that people don't even realise they have. This book is genuinely horrifying (ironically, it will keep you up all night fretting). Some of the more striking findings are the absolute madness of night shifts and junior doctor rotas, the self destructive cruelty of school starts that require kids to be awake at 6, and the hecatombs of deaths caused by tired drivers. We've once again managed to set up a social structure apparently designed to cause as much mental and emotional harm as possible to humans. Well done us. I would really like to dismiss all this as alarmist nonsense but the weight of research and the author's qualifications for writing this makes that quite hard, so instead I might just go to bed early forever. Really very scary and depressing to read, but seriously important. (Also highly readable and clearly written, unlike many books by experts for laypeople.)"
The Gene: An Intimate History,Siddhartha Mukherjee,4.36,"I have this tendency, when I read a book as brilliantly informing as this one, to wipe the froth from my mouth, shuffle the pages of notes I've written contemporaneous to the reading, and plunge into the cocktail party which is this forum, grabbing each of you by the virtual lapels, and launching into a lecture about one of the hundreds of things I learned in the process. As if, you know, I missed some of the froth.So, imagine me back from some journey, casting pleasantries aside, and launching wild-eyed and, yes, maybe a little frothy, insisting that you grasp the fraction of what I've learned via the fraction of my ability to explain, as if it is the most important thing in the world. Until next week's book and next week's cocktail party, that is. Passionate and off-putting. Aware, but unable to stop myself. Yup, that's me. But I have a defense.There's probably a gene that makes me so.Seems I got more than blue eyes from Mom, more than dark hair from Dad. There are many chambers of the human heart and many caverns in the human mind, but they are all there somewhere pinned onto the genome which is Tony.--This book is worth the read just for the section on sickle-cell anemia, or the one explaining the genetic basis for sexual identity, or the story of Mitochondrial Eve. --Did you know that when the Allied forces entered the Nazi death camps, they found an inordinate number of twins among the survivors. This was so because Mengele was fascinated by Zwillinge? These survivors, sharing as they did identical genetic markers, served as the subjects of much subsequent genetic research.--The problem with racial discrimination . . . is not the inference of a person's race from their genetic characteristics. It is quite the opposite: it is the inference of a person's characteristics from their race. But, I've now learned, ""the vast proportion of genetic diversity (85 to 90 percent) occurs within so-called races (i.e., within Asians or Africans) and only a minor proportion (7 percent) between racial groups...""--I knew the story of Carrie Buck, legally sterilized after an Opinion by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stating ""Three generations of imbeciles is enough."" But Mukherjee lets that story hover over us as he takes us to a lecture he attended in 2013, a lecture given by a fifteen year-old girl named Erika, who suffered from a severe, progressive degenerative disease, causing muscle tremors that progressively worsened. She tried new drugs, clinical trials. Nothing worked. Yet there she was speaking to this hall of scientists, ""by far, among the most articulate, introspective teenagers that I have ever encountered."" A prenatal test to find the mutations that caused Erika's condition is theoretically possible. We could, bluntly, prevent future Erikas. Mukherjee lets us ponder this as he watches Erika being pushed by her mother across a parking lot in her wheelchair, ""her scarf billowing behind her, like an epilogue.""It's that last little bit, that fragment of a quote like a piece of DNA, that I hope exposes why this book had such a purchase on me. It's not just that Mukherjee can take a very complicated scientific subject and make it understandable. It's that he does so with really gorgeous writing.At one point he is explaining how 'we' got here, how 'humans' began on an arid mesa in South Africa and, from there, ""went west, as young men often do..."" The migrants made it to the northeastern edge of Ethiopia or Egypt, ""where the Red Sea narrows to a slitlike strait."" And then he writes this: There was no one there to part the ocean. We do not know what drove these men and women to fling themselves across the water, or how they managed to cross it. . . What is certain is that every perilous ocean-crossing left hardly any survivors--perhaps as few as six hundred men and women. Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Americans are the descendants of these drastic bottlenecks, and this corkscrew of history too has left its signature in our genomes. In a genetic sense, nearly all of us who emerged out of Africa, gasping for land and air, are even more closely yoked than previously imagined. We were on the same boat, brother.The same but different; different but the same. I'll stop there, having no doubt expressed my enthusiasm better than my understanding of human genetics. I'll stop even though the clicker below says I have 15,480 characters left, or about 500 less than the number of genes in one of my cells. But one of the truly entertaining parts of this book was the author's use of quotes. So, since I'm feeling epigrammy, I'll add my favorites to the comments.Bye. I have to go.","I think this was really good, and even better than The Emperor of All Maladies which I just read recently as well. I might have enjoyed this one more because it's relevant to my current day to day thing though. I really liked the way it ties in the personal elements of genetics through out the book and how it acknowledges really important questions of what we actually deem normal and healthy. I feel like a lot of times there isn't as much acknowledgement of the tradeoffs made when trying to eliminate genetic variants that in this current environment are maladaptive or considered pathological but may confer other advantages in a different environment. Also I think there isn't as much acknowledgement that we don't know enough to even say if a specific variant is abnormal, in the colloquial sense, and what the downstream effects might be to eliminating that specific variant. I think Mukherjee did a great job reckoning with that here. I also just really like have historical context and things explained to me accessibly but in a thorough fashion. This was really great, definitely going to end up being one of the better books I read this year.","Hello bookish peeps,Another one of my review has been posted on our country's largest daily newspaper's website, The Times of India. ""This book is the story of the birth, growth, and future of one of the most powerful and dangerous ideas in the history of science: the ""gene,"" the fundamental unit of heredity, and the basic unit of all biological information. I""~Siddhartha MukherjeeThe 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner, Siddhartha Mukherjee, is back with another incredibly well-written book, The Gene: An Intimate History that unfolds the extensive and profound knowledge and research about human genome and its genetics that reflects beyond the definition of both basic and advanced science. The above quote by the author, himself, simply outlines the story line of this in-depth and thorough yet intimidating book about genes.Since the primeval times, it has been observed that living organisms can pass down attributes to their offspring, who can then pass down to their own children and so on. The author begins his book with Gregor Johann Mendel, a scientist, who observed the nature of genes in pea plants by isolating them to discover the transmissible characteristics in pea plants. Thomas Hunt Morgan, who in the early 20th century observed a study on fruit flies to state the real location of genes in a living organism's cell. The author has mathematically noted down each milestone in genetic science in this book, rather descriptively. But with all this, the author ensures that his readers do not lose their focus from the fact that study of genes is not anymore just a progressive or evolutionary aspect in science and medicines, rather it is a study and observation about how an individual is insufficiently deciphering the technological advancement in the science of genetics as well as the study of oneself.Siddhartha Mukherjee sweepingly shares his own Bengali-family medical and genetic history through this book. This includes his father with a genetically challenged brain illness, his mother and her twin sisters and the sudden onset of schizophrenia among his cousins and uncles, thereby inducing fear for the future generations and shock and knowledge about the unknown genetic defects underlying in his family history of hereditary.The author's writing has a lot of gravity, meaning and research affixed with true facts, that might or might not be able to bring a change among the readers to look at this scientific study of genes and its underlying messages in a different way, but it will definitely open the tight-shut windows about human genome in the minds of the readers. In a crux, the book will gracefully enlighten the readers. The narrative is articulate and I believe the book is written in a way that even if you are not accustomed to big scientific and medical terminologies, they can easily be comprehended.Please follow the link below to read my review:http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/li...Thank you!"
The Book of Alchemy: A Creative Practice for an Inspired Life,Suleika Jaouad,4.33,"For those who love to journal and for those who want to journal... Whether or not you are familiar with Jaouad's Substack newsletter ""Isolation Journals"", you are in for a treat with this book. Born from Jaouad's love of journaling and documenting, The Isolation Journals was created in 2020 during the height of the pandemic when she started communal journaling, inviting others to contribute. Each ""journal"" entry—or essay—that was shared offered a prompt for the rest of the readers to get their creative juices flowing.The Book of Alchemy is a collection of 100 of those essays from The Isolation Journals, each offering a prompt that relates back to the essay and invites readers to open up their journals and their hearts, and write their own piece. With 100 different prompts on Beginning; Memory; Fear; Seeing; Love; Body; Rebuilding; Ego; Purpose; and Alchemy; The Book of Alchemy will take readers through a slew of outsider experiences that force them to turn inward, reflect, and recognize the universal experience of being human. This book best works as a ""100 days of journaling"" practice, reading one essay and prompt per day. But if you are anything like me, you don't have the patience for that. In that case, my best advice with this book would be to settle in with it and read through the whole thing—cover to cover—and see what resonates with you, what speaks to you. When you finish, start from the beginning again. Only this time, let yourself move through the prompts one day at a time. With essays from Dani Shapiro, Melissa Febos, Erin Khar, Jon Batiste, Laura McKowen, Elizabeth Gilbert, LaTonya Yvette, Ann Patchett, and so many more, it is sure to delight. I look forward to grabbing my own physical copy when it releases so I can underline, highlight, and deeply engage. Thank you Penguin Random House for the early copy in exchange for an honest review. Available Apr. 22 2025","Suleika Jaouad is the kind of person I'd like to be friends with, and her personality shines through this collection of 100 writing prompts, structured around 10 topics: Beginning, memory, fear, seeing, love, the body, rebuilding, ego, purpose, and alchemy. The author was first diagnosed with leukemia in 2011, the cancer has since returned twice (if you haven't yet, you should watch ""American Symphony"", the award-winning documentary that shows a year in the life of her husband Jon Batiste who wrote his first symphony during Jaouad's relapse). The creative practice of writing has given Jaouad strength and clarity, and this collection assembles short texts and prompts illustrating how journaling can lead to higher self-knowledge and an improved mental health. Each of the ten chapters offers an introduction by Jaouad, then gives voice to collaborators like Hanif Abdurraqib, Kiese Laymon, Ann Patchett, Salman Rushdie, George Saunders, Gloria Steinem, Jia Tolentino and of course Jon Batiste (love this guy). It really is a practice book, a publication to be worked with, a useful tool to get inspired and fight every writer's worst nightmare: The empty page. And as such, it's super-functional - even though the intros by Jaouad become slightly repetitive (then again, I can't hear enough dog stories by a fellow dog lover). Truly lives up to the promise of being inspiring, and without being too twee and whimsical.","What is the name of this book??? According to the title it's The Book of Alchemy, but by the review it seems to be The Book of Prompts. Very confusing."
I Wish Someone Had Told Me...: The Best Advice for Building a Great Career and a Meaningful Life,Dana Perino,4.26,"2/DNF ⭐️ Don’t get me wrong, I usually enjoy Perino’s books, but this isn’t so much a book but a compilation of short interviews with people she has known during her career, giving advice that everyone has heard a million times before. I got halfway through before I finally decided to give up.","A great read about how to build a life and a to be successful at work from a panel of contributors. It has easy to rely advice on healthy eatting, exercise, finances and building up savings now for the retirement years. best tidbit of advice: head down, mouth shut, eyes (and ears) open. ---Paul Mauro","I originally got this for my daughter's graduation from college, but I found myself reading it instead. She'll probably receive it later this year for her birthday. Anyway, I found the format of the book great for sharing advice; short responses by a variety of the author's colleagues and personal friends. Not all of the advice was Fox-centric which could be a turn-off for some people. Instead, it was well-rounded and sound. I found myself putting sticky notes on several pages that I wanted to emphasize to my daughter when she reads it. Well done! I look forward to reading some of Ms. Perino's earlier books."
The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,3.81,"I want to give it 20 stars! I actually recognized a part of the neurocognitive testing that I had to determine if I had Mild Cognitive Impairment or worse! That was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, which I hated with so much vigor when taking it. It determines how rigid or flexible your thinking is. The test gives you a the task of figuring out which card is next in the sequence. Doesn’t sound bad, does it? But now I know why the test made me angry and frustrated. The rules of the sorting change while you take the test. It starts out with sequence that is easy to figure out, You think you know the rules. then the rules change, over and over again. I can remember my anger while taking the test, how dare they change the rules! If you are flexible thinker you will soon realize the rules have been changed and figure what works until the rules change again. Apparently my reaction to the test was like many of the college kids who took the test. Change is painful when your structure of thinking doesn’t work and you have to figure out the rules again.The part about brainwashing seems logical and explains why it is so difficult to change the thinking of a person like in a cult to change. It shows why it so difficult to undo the damage done to a brainwashed individual.I was so glad to learn about the work of Else Frenkel-Brunswik. She left Poland and later Austria to escape Jewish persecution. In United States, she conducted vey important interviews with children. She found that rigidity, like dividing into black and white, good and evil, strong vs. evil with no middle gradations, is demonstrated through strongly prejudiced children.The author delves into parts of the brain and dopamine neurons. The brain and inner workings are extremely complex and amazing. I wish I had an animation of the processes that she discussed that I could watch several times to understand it better.I love the humor that the author employs with the ""whispers"" back and forth during the explanations, she knows that what had been learned is a lot to take in and she leads us through in a friendly and careful way.The good part is that this book makes me think! The bad part is that if I have to take Neurocognitive Testing again, I know how to cheat to get a better score!If you would like your brain to have some healthy exercise, please read this book! I am very interested in the future developments in how political beliefs and the biology of the brain relate.","I was looking forward to reading something between neuroscience and political science, but sadly this book was a huge disappointment. Many of the assumptions that Zmigrod makes are unsupported, sometimes even presumptuous, and make the whole book project dubious. All in all, it is more subjective stream of random thoughts than evidence-based, scientifically sound literature.Most importantly, throughout the book, the author doesn't define exactly what ideologies are. Zmigrod takes ""ideological"" to mean anything that is dogmatic (by any standard, who knows). Also, the game tests and surveys she conducts and describes in the book don't measure ideologies, just some dispositions (flexibility, adaptability) that (maybe) make someone more likely to lean towards *some* ideology (which is a correlation, not a causal mechanism). Second, she doesn't provide references to almost anything and I believe she sometimes misinterpretes theorists she criticizes, ending up labelling them with pathethic adjectives. Most notable example is ""the conspiratorial and populist overtones in Marx's philosophy"" or ""the calamitous irony in Marx's hatred of ideology"". This culminates in the Epilogue section of the book, which she approaches as a rather absurd event, in which she presents her research findings to an audience consisting of the scholars mentioned in the book, including Marx. In this self-congratulatory section she tells people like Arendt, Marx or Frenkel-Brunswik how wrong their questions are (although it is Zmigrod who actually formulates them) and how unique and important her own research is. The peak of the absurdity and self-indulgence of the writing are the following two quotes, taken from the Epilogue:1""But scientists don't do ideology critique,"" an accusatory scholar of the humanities resounds sceptically. ""This is the task of philosophers, historians, economists, sociologists, and cultural thinkers."" Why not? I ask, recalling that every aggression is an act of defence. 2""These are excellent methods for critique!"" Marx stresses. Indeed, they are.","I’m on page 89, 1/3 of the way through. I look forward to getting to the actual science, which is what interests me. But so far, it is mostly overwrought bloviating. What I’ve read so far could have been thoroughly covered in ten pages. Very disappointed. In contrast to, for example, Kahneman’s Thinking Fast And Slow, whose subject matter is equally esoteric but which is a much more enjoyable and approachable read.——Finished now and reduced stars from 2 to 1. This is ho-hum book, written almost as a stream of consciousness. Condescending, self-congratulatory. Scientific research findings are of the “so what”variety. Quite the waste of money and time."
"365 Happy Bedtime Mantras: Improve Your Sleep, Release Stress, and Enjoy Your Dreams",Shannon Kaiser,4.00,"I absolutely loved this book! It’s such a thoughtful guide to improving sleep, blending helpful insights on rest, creating a bedtime toolkit, and establishing a calming routine. The section with mantras is especially wonderful—each one comes with a full-page devotional that feels so personal, including the mantra itself, a reflective message, a soothing quote, and a restful ritual to try that night. The layout is beautifully designed and easy on the eyes, making it a pleasure to use. I was thrilled to find out it’s also being released as a deck! I’ll definitely be using the deck version, but the book is just as valuable, depending on your preference. What I really appreciated is that it’s not tied to any specific religious belief, so it feels inclusive for anyone seeking better rest. If you’re looking for a gentle, effective way to improve your sleep, this resource is a winner!","So I couldn’t wait a whole year to post a review, even though this is a daily read. It’s heart warming, sometimes funny, thoughtful, and a quick little “food for thought” before bed or even in the morning as part of the morning routine. A sweet little book that I have highlighted and dog eared already and looking forward to the rest of the year (book). Thank you 😊Disclaimer - I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway.",Nice 👍 reading books
The Life That's Waiting,Brianna Wiest,4.25,"3.5⭐️ Not my favorite of Wiest’s books but still a worthwhile read in small doses. Reading this for a prolonged period results in the content getting a bit rambley and repetitive. Like her other books, not all the subjects hit for everyone, and for me the majority weren’t the most relatable. Those that were though, were beautifully written and profound. I love reading these books for like 5 minutes in the morning with my coffee, setting the tone and intention for the day.","If you’re going through a hard time in your life this book will definitely help you guide through the way. I love Brianna Wiest, every single one of her books are a weighted blanket for the soul",Everything that I needed in my life right now. I’ll definitely be pulling this off the shelf time and again as an “encyclopedia of feelings” of sorts as she mentions.
De meidenmethode: Hoe je verdomme eindelijk van jezelf gaat houden,Lotte van Eijk,4.13,"Mede zonder Lotte was ik nooit de meid geworden die ik tot de dag van vandaag ben!🥹❤️ Ik volg deze meid al 8 jaar en nu heb ik gewoon haar fucking boek gelezen!!Ik heb gehuild gisteren bij haar boekpresentatie in de Donner, ik heb gehuild toen ik haar zag en ik heb gehuild toen ik haar boek aan het lezen was. En meiden, jullie moeten dit lezen! Want ja, fuck de norm, schat. Lullen doen ze toch wel, en jij ook, dus hou gewoon je bek! Je hoort Lotte alles gewoon voorlezen in je hoofd, prachtig! Ze heeft kennis en brengt dit heel “simpel” over en ze heeft een begrippenlijst aan het einde van haar boek. Hoe handig! Zoals ze het zegt: “Kennis is macht.” En daar moeten we dan wat mee doen!Zelfliefde is een werkwoord. Ik keur dit helemaal goed, ook als docent Nederlands. Want hoe belangrijk is het dat we eens van onszelf gaan houden en ook liever naar elkaar gaan zijn, zonder oordeel? Lotte geeft hele makkelijke en praktische tips die wij meiden meteen kunnen toepassen in ons dagelijks leven. Dus waar wachten we nog op? Hup hup!Ook leest het boek goed weg en is het ADHD-proof, wat leest dat heerlijk! Prachtige illustraties die haar verhaal versterken.Dit is voor mij een nieuwe bijbel. Een boek dat je op je nachtkastje legt en bij het opstaan en slapen gaan gewoon even doorleest. Wie wil dat nou niet? Dus meiden, ren naar de winkel, koop en lees dit boek! Dit boek voelt als het krijgen van een warme knuffel. En wie weet schrijft Lotte ooit weer een nieuw boek? Ik hoop het!Bedankt lieve Lotte!❤️Oh, en vergeet niet te pimpelen, meiden! Pimpelen is een recht en heeft prioriteit. Let’s go!🥳🥂","Echt oprecht één van de beste zelfhulpboeken die ik ooit gelezen heb, en waar ik ook echt iets geleerd heb. Omdat het verder gaat dan het individualisme, en kijkt naar hoe wij met elkaar de samenleving mooier kunnen maken. Ook zet Lotte o.a. super toegankelijk en duidelijk uiteen waar vetfobie vandaan komt (spoiler, racisme), hoe BMI een maatstaf is wat voor geen meter klopt, hoe dikke mensen dood gaan omdat ze niet de zorg krijgen die ze verdienen vanwege hun gewicht, wat cis personen kunnen leren van trans mensen en hoe wonen een basisrecht is. Koop ook zeker de boeken van de Zwarte mensen en mensen van kleur die hen aanhaalt, en fijn dat die credits ook worden gegeven.Het enige minpuntje vond ik dat er op een gegeven moment ""niet-dunne"" en ""niet-witte"" mensen beschreven staat. Laat die norm lekker los en beschrijf wie je wil beschrijven. Maar dat is echt een mini puntje.","Of je nu net begint te leren om van jezelf te houden of hier al langer aan werkt, dit boek voelt als een dikke knuffel en een enorme steun in de rug. Ik las het audioboek en Lotte heeft dit helemaal op haar eigen manier ingesproken, waardoor het voelde alsof hen een goede vriend is die je eens even stevig toespreekt om liever te zijn voor jezelf. Echt een boek om regelmatig op te pakken op momenten dat je wat minder stevig in je schoenen staat."

"Finding Your Walden: How to Strive Less, Simplify More, and Embrace What Matters Most",Jen Tota McGivney,4.62,"A quick read and a nice little guidebook to deal with some of the “issues of the day.” In an effort to slay the Beast who is Bezos by myself, I bought this book at a local brick and mortar bookstore in my hometown of Charlotte, NC. Shout out to Charlotte and Park Road Books. The author lives in Charlotte, which I assume is why I was able to get a signed copy before the actual publication date. I think we can all freely admit that we are over-saturated with our own digital footprints. I know I am. Other than the book being a mini-bio of Henry David Thoreau, it also functioned as a mitigation tool for the aforementioned digital saturation. There were also suggestions on how to otherwise (beyond digitally) live a well-balanced and simpler life. Among the tools documented were the minimalist lifestyle, community engagement, family and friend time, work-life balance, vacation, staycation, meditation, and more. Each chapter ended with a handful of questions to contemplate and throughout, the author provided references to other authors and techniques. I’ve already ordered a book that she references a handful of times. Congrats to the author on her first publication.",NA,NA

The Mysterious Mind: How to Use Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science to Heal Your Headaches and Reclaim Your Health,Trupti Gokani,4.13,"Migraine Help Dr Gokani gets it. She has actually treated and helped the complex and horrible types of rare migraines so many neurologists have only thrown pills at or given up on treating. Her mix of experience and research on neurology, functional medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine give her a unique perspective on patients with migraine. This book has quizzes, plans, and information, not just case studies, but it’s easy to understand.","She has good information, but I felt like she could have expounded a lot more on what to eat for each dosha. I didn't really learn anything new in the book, but it is a good starting place for healing from migraine. It just lacks details to really accomplish that goal. However, I did appreciate that she has good research and balances western and eastern medicine well. It's not full of fluff or just telling people what they want to hear like so many migraine books are.",Very insightful read...What powerful insight into how our bodies work on an Ayurvedic level. Very well written for the practitioner and lay person as well. Can't wait to do some further research and use the information to help bring healing.
The Let Them Theory,Mel Robbins,4.16,"This is the worst book that I will read in 2025. I can write this with confidence - in January - because it is one of the worst books I have read in my life, and I have just turned 56.If you want to understand how Donald Trump became President... If you want to understand why there is a focus on influencers rather than intelligent people who know what they are doing... If you want to understand the decontexualization of poverty or homelessness... Then this is your book.What is happening? Let's do this...We have an under-performing, under-educated woman summoning under-refereed research to offer a commentary about life. Her own life has been punctuated by a series of failures. Yet she then uses these failures from her husband and children to create a 'theory.'Please note: the word 'theory' is used in the title. This is not a 'theory'. What is offered is a vibe. An opinion. A data set of one. The idea that readers know so little that this vibe is accepted as a theory - shows why we are in the mess we are in...Let's present some evidence about this book... Which is what this book does not do.  Here are the edited highlights of this book:“How I changed my life”“I knew I wanted to teach the 5 second rule full time and somehow make this my career, but I didn’t know how. l Looking back, I can see how paralysed I was with imposter syndrome. What right did I have to call myself an expert in anything?”“When people would ask if I had a Ph.D or if I was a therapist, I would say, “No, I learned everything the hard way – by screwing up my own life and then having to fix it” “I’ve been told over and over again that I have this amazing ability to distill complex ideas and scientific research into simple, actionable advice that anyone can use to improve their life” “I have made it my mission to find and share many simple tools to help anyone create a better life” “The truth is, other people hold no real power over you unless you give it to them” “No matter what is happening … you still hold the power”“People do what they feel like doing”“Let Them struggle”""Chris [her husband] had developed a major problem with alcohol. He was drinking away the stress and engaging in other self-destructive behaviors. He was depressed, anxious, and knew he could no longer live like this” “I was speaking to my therapist, Anne, about this.”“You have the power.""“You can have the life you’ve always wanted. You can be a millionaire.”“No one else can stop you. It’s all on you.” My new t-shirt slogan in life is - things could be worse. You could be Chris. You could be married to Mel Robbins and have your life, and your weaknesses and fears presented in a truly rubbish self help book.On behalf of all the people who have lost their lives through homelessness, grief, tragedy and death, you know what, Mel? Sometimes, we don't have the power. Sometimes, we don't want to be a millionaire. Sometimes, we have been treated like rubbish by late capitalism and lost our lives, our love, our hopes, our future.Let them in not a theory. It is nonsense. It is a vibe. She has thrown her own family under a bus to offer an opinion.This book is a warning for academics. Actual scholars. Not #randoms doing Ted talks. If we do not disseminate our research widely and appropriately, a mediocre woman whose career highlight is a Ted talk and an Oprah interview will end up offering advice to the next generation.Let's not - Let Them. Let's commit to research. Let's commit to theory. Let's commit to interpretation. Let's commit to ideas beyond an individual. Let's understand history and geography and meaning.Let us be defiant scholars. Who believe in the world. Not rehashing the stories of one woman and her family.Chris - we're with you.","I rarely write reviews, but this book feels like a personal insult to readers’ intelligence and ethics.I first heard about Let Them on Oprah’s show, where it was praised as one of the best books she'd ever read. Intrigued by the endorsement, I gave it a try—and quickly regretted my decision.Let’s address the elephant in the room: this idea is far from revolutionary. Philosophers like the Stoics—and countless others—have articulated this concept for centuries: accept what you must, control what you can, and make empowered choices rooted in reality. Packaging this timeless wisdom as a “theory” feels not only gimmicky but borderline disrespectful to the rich history of these teachings.But the real problem is deeper. Let Them borrows heavily—if not entirely—from a poem by Cassie Phillips, shared online long before Mel's viral video. In that video, Mel casually mentions she ""heard something"" before launching into what is essentially Let Them, the poem. Instead of properly crediting the original author, Mel parlayed the phrase into a book deal and, shockingly, fabricated a story on Oprah, claiming the concept was inspired by her daughter's reaction—a cascade of ""Let Them(s)"". This blatant erasure of Cassie Phillips is unacceptable. Where is the acknowledgement of her work?To the Mel Robbins cult, I encourage you to read all the provided links before defending the former lawyer. You seek facts—well, they’re all right here. I am not responsible for how they make you feel, just as you cannot twist the truth to suit your comfort.EDIT: Cassie is rightly suing Mel: https://www.facebook.com/cassie.sturg...?UPDATE (it’s worse than I originally thought):(1) https://open.substack.com/pub/sagejus...?(2) https://open.substack.com/pub/sagejus...?Mel’s approach feels calculated. This isn’t the first time she’s used a dramatic backstory to sell a book, but this time, the cracks are glaring. The result is a shallow, ego-driven cash grab, devoid of nuance and authenticity. It’s another reminder that hype often overshadows substance, and popularity doesn’t equate to originality.I’m astonished this book was published. It’s a stark example of how far opportunism can go when the spotlight blinds accountability.","Just let them.If they want to choose something or someone over you, LET THEM.If they want to go weeks without talking to you, LET THEM.If they are okay with never seeing you, LET THEM.If they are okay with always putting themselves first, LET THEM.If they are showing you who they are and not what you perceived them to be, LET THEM.If they want to follow the crowd, LET THEM.If they want to judge or misunderstand you, LET THEM.If they act like they can live without you, LET THEM.If they want to walk out of your life and leave, hold the door open, AND LET THEM.Let them lose you.You were never theirs because you were always your own.So let them.Let them show you who they truly are, not tell you.Let them prove how worthy they are of your time.Let them make the necessary steps to be a part of your life.Let them earn your forgiveness.Let them call you to talk about ordinary things.Let them take you out on a Thursday.Let them talk about anything and everything just because it’s you they are talking to.Let them have a safe place in you.Let them see the heart in you that didn’t harden.Let them love you.A Poem by Cassie Phillips, not a theory by Mel Robbings."
The Psychology of Money,Morgan Housel,4.29,"Pithy book. Here's some for you: 
   1. People act from their experiences. Don't judge from yours. 
 

2. Luck & Risk is all around you. They don't fit the stories you want to tell.

3. If you can't recognize when you have enough, you will soon have nothing.

4. Warren Buffet could have been an ordinary investor if not for his longevity.Investing - if done well - is utterly boring. It’s because the chief ingredient in the growth of a portfolio is time.

5. More than big returns, be financially unbreakable. If you are unbreakable you actually will get the biggest returns, because will be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.

6. The tail wags the dog in Finance and Business. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.

7. People want to become wealthier to make them happier. Happiness is a complicated subject because everyone’s different. But if there’s a common denominator in happiness—a universal fuel of joy—it’s that people want to control their lives.It is the highest dividend money pays.

8. The Man in the Fancy Car is irrelevant, because the observers are busy imagining themselves in it.

9. There is no faster way to feel rich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. There's no faster way to not be rich as well. That's the paradox of wealth.

10. One of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.Dont spend money to show you have money.Savings = Income - Ego

11. Adopt a reasonable strategy, not an ultra rational one. The plan that you are able to stick to is better than the one that looks good on a spreadsheet.

12. ""Things that have never happened before happen all the time.”History is mostly the study of surprising events. 2020 should have taught us this, of course.

13. Margin of Safety—you can also call it room for error—is the only effective way to safely navigate a world that is governed by odds, not certainties.

14. An underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves.Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.

15. Don't think of market losses from fluctuations as a fine, but as an admission fee. It'll help you stay in longer.

16. The financial game has one fundamental parameter - the time horizon.Never copy someone working with a different time horizon than you.

17. Optimism is the best bet for most people because the world tends to get better for most people most of the time.Progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.Pessimism sounds smarter, but optimism is the long game.

18. Trying to make sense of the world is the cause of most mistakes.Psychologist Philip Tetlock once wrote: “We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.”Respect the mess.","This was a short but enjoyable read. The main point is that we are complicated creatures who have complicated relationships with money. It’s ok and expected to not base every decision off of cold Excel calculations. Instead of pretending we will, here is some of the advice he recommends:Don’t try and time the market. Dollar cost average. 85% of large cap fund managers did not beat the S&P 500. Stock picking isn’t the worst thing ever but know the odds are not in your favor. Doing some of that is OK but you should primarily stick with low cost index funds.Always keep an eye on greed creeping in. Make sure to avoid the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses.Investing a lot when you’re younger is so important. The vast majority of Warren Buffett’s wealth is because of how early he started investing, more so than having a higher rate of return. compounding is a wonderful thing.Wealth usually ends up being more about how much money you save rather than how much you earn from your job or the right investments.Saving is the gap between your income and your ego. Having money saved gives you flexibility in many facets of life and immeasurable peace of mind. It allows you to do what you want, when you want it.It’s OK to do something that gives you peace of mind even if it’s not the best financial decision. For example, finishing student loan payments with a 4% interest-rate even though you could make more by reducing payments and investing some of that in the market.Expect the unexpected when it comes to the stock market, and don’t pull out money during downturns. Have a 1/3 buffer. For example, if the US stock market usually returns 6.9% after inflation, prepare for 4.6%. You may retire in a bear market or the past may not repeat itself. To the point of not trying to time the market: only 9% of tactical mutual funds, those that try to re-allocate stock versus bond percentage based on economic forecasts, ended up doing better than just leaving it in. Enduring downturns is the cost of compounding, and it’s well worth the price. Think of market volatility as a fee. You get what you pay for.Remember that people, especially the media, tend to air on the side of pessimism even if things usually get better over time.All things considered, I would recommend this book!","The blog post that turned into a bookhttp://www.collaborativefund.com/blog...Teh Hooi Ling’s reviewhttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/weal...CFA webinarhttps://annual.cfainstitute.org/speak...https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/invest...The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

The Tell: A Memoir,Amy   Griffin,4.17,"Check TWs // Absolutely heartbreaking to listen to someone recount their childhood trauma, but thank you for sharing your story with the world, Amy!","I'm gonna go three stars I guess. I have some problems with this book largely on how it was presented at a book talk I attended, where a bunch of rich white women self-congratulated on being the most important people ever to talk about sexual abuse and how this book will change everyone's lives because the message is about how sharing about abuse is important, as if no one has ever come forward and spoken up about abuse before for this very reason? It was one of the worst displays of self-obsessed privilege I've ever seen and so fucking cringe, especially when after reading the book I found that the author isn't really at all an advocate for survivors in any tangible way? Even the epilogue is like ""if you're a survivor and need resources there's some links on my website idk"" like could not even be bothered to include any links or organizations or messages of support to survivors in this super triggering book that features graphic descriptions of childhood sexual abuse. The premise is that the author realizes she was abused as a child after an MDMA-assisted therapy session, so she decides to work on coming to terms with everything she has to go through and process decades later by telling the people in her life. What a horrendous thing to endure and how difficult it must have been to go through recovery from this kind of trauma! Learning about the abuse she had repressed and how she dealt with it at the time also informs the author about so many of her behaviors and personality traits, all of which were formed as kind of subconscious defense mechanisms. These discoveries are fascinating, and how she comes to terms with these traits – and even tries to change many of them in some ways – is powerful.My review is not about her experiences or her story, but more about how kind of insensitive it is to proclaim yourself a martyr for all survivors when really I do not understand where that sense of entitlement is coming from. Literally millions of women have been abused or violated in a similar way and have talked about it for eons. I think it was especially hard to understand having recently read Amanda Nguyen's and Chanel Miller's books, where they – both non-white, non-privileged women – give up careers to fight for justice not only for themselves but as a way to ensure other survivors wouldn't have to suffer in the same way. I'm not saying every survivor needs to do what they did to be heroic, simply getting out of bed and facing each day is fucking heroic for survivors! But this book promoting itself as the most important voice ever in survivorship feels super tone deaf when there are many other experts on this topic who discuss abuse and the aftermath more tactfully, meaningfully, and knowledgeably than this private equity exec who was able to write a book because she's rich and connected, not because she has any qualifications or expertise to responsibly help people. Even her path to getting justice for herself – hiring a corporate lawyer in New York and having them bully her small Texas town's police force into making her decades-old case that has no physical evidence and therefore a very small chance of making it past the investigative stage a priority – is out-of-touch with how 99.9% of the population is equipped to deal with similar situations.This is her story, so obviously she deserves to share it and obviously her wealth and privilege does not cosmically balance out the trauma she endured. But had this book simply existed SOLELY as a memoir without all of the surrounding pretentious nonsense about how she is single-handedly saving the world, I would've valued it more for what it is – a well-written, introspective, and devastating story about all the ways we suffer from abuse, especially in terms of complicated childhood abuse where memories are unclear or buried entirely, with these cases very rarely tied up with neat little bows in the end. Instead, the insane behavior at the book event and other things the author has said just completely rubbed me the wrong way and unfortunately it affected how I read her story. Is IS an important story to tell and I'm sure it will help survivors come forward and want to talk about their own abuse but it's not groundbreaking or trailblazing in the way it's being heralded, almost entirely by the author herself.One last thought more about the writing – while I think most of this is really well-written, many of the dialogues read like this woman has never had a conversation with other people before, especially when she speaks with her 11-year-old daughter, who is depicted as a wise old soul who often acts as a therapist and the pillar of emotional support for her mother as she goes through this experience. That's fine, I'm sure it's grounded in truth, but their convos in this book are preposterous, complete with psychobabble lingo and the kind of sage advice a child simply is not equipped to give. It's giving this meme or a Delaney Rowe ""precocious child"" TikTok and I couldn't stop rolling my eyes.","The Tell touches on so many important topics and is one of the better non-fiction books I’ve read recently. We follow Amy as she bravely tells how repressed memories can affect our everyday lives as well as her journey through healing. The Tell discusses how harmful the conservative southern culture can be and the pressure this culture puts on women to always be perfect. The story also delves into the criminal justice system and how difficult it is for assault survivors to obtain justice. Following Amy from her idyllic Texas childhood to becoming a strong survivor is something that I won't be forgetting anytime soon. I’ve long been interested in the healing powers of psychedelics and I loved learning more about how they are used to treat and heal trauma while reading this one. I listened to the audiobook version of The Tell which is narrated by the author. If you decide to pick this one up, I highly recommend this format. The Tell by Amy Griffin was published on March 11 so it’s available now. Many thanks to Penguin Random House Audio for the gifted audiobook!"
Untamed,"Glennon Doyle, Glennon Doyle Melton (Pseudonym)",3.98,"Audiobook... read by Glennon DoyleMy thoughts and feelings changed ‘several’ times - from positive to negative - back to positive- back to negative!!!By the end.... I was just glad to be DONE! If this book was ‘clearly’ a memoir... I wouldn’t have felt annoyed. I often didn’t buy her strategies in achieving emotional balance—-because ‘she’ lacked balance in important areas of life: true empathy for others.Glennon will ALWAYS put her needs and desires ‘before’ others. She demonstrated several times how she swung that pendulum from being a person who didn’t know how to please herself to no longer pleasing anyone. Glennon’s selfish tone towards others was brutal - rather than unflinching honest. She was down right mean, righteous at times. I began to wonder if Glennon had respect for ‘anyone’ other than herself. Does she realize that many women know who they are? We don’t all judge our value ourselves by the size of thighs? ‘Part’ of being a whole contributing human being is sometimes putting other people’s needs first ( at cause), before our own.Glennon is not there yet....she still needs to ‘prove’ that she’s her own woman goddamnit!! Power to Glennon! This review would make ZERO DIFFERENCE to Glennon. She said herself, she doesn’t give a rats ass about my opinion - or what I think of her, anyway. So how do people contribute ‘back’ to her? Where is her opening to ‘hearing’ that there might be a reason some of us readers ‘might’ (the Glennon sin?), feel she has a few things to still learn about the balance between being who we are - without verbally purging righteousness onto others. Glennon clearly’ states she only cares about herself - over and over and over again.Yes... this is a happy world with Glennon’s savvy wisdom.She transferred one disorder… (over-eating, purging, over drinking, trouble with the law,), to a self serving shaming-others for not being like ‘her’. PARTS WERE GOOD - in the beginning - until she chewed the human race to threads! Her self righteous me me me - ME FIRST - no-pleasing others rule became annoying. I lost total respect!!!I appreciated a few chapters in this book... I liked her ‘own’ discovery about parenting - and where she went south in giving her son the message that his life (studying for school, tests the next day, etc.), were more important than his responsibility as a contributing member to the family. After Glendon’s realization- that she was raising a self- centered - self serving kid- she made corrections. She began to demand his respect and contributions to the family. Now her kid did the dishes after dinner -(she made the meal after all). Glennon’s ‘a-ha’ moments of parenting ‘discoveries’ ....that raising a privileged son wasn’t doing him any long term service, was admirable. I had much respect for Glennon’s ‘moral’ discovery—I wished I had made that discovery myself when I was raising our daughters, myself. I ‘allowed’ our daughters to do their homework ( skip dishes) because why? because their life wellness out in ‘their’ world was more important than them ‘contributing’ to ‘our’ family. I did the fricken dishes -I made the meals -I did the cleaning - Paul supported our family financially. Hell - I made their lunches - drove them to their many activities every single day - ( private independent schools, music lessons, sports, dance, theater, Hebrew school, etc) I was their slave and I was wrong!!! I never taught them to sincerely value and respect Paul and I. Guess what? Both daughters are successful in the world and independent - but only one of them respects Paul and I fully and expresses it.So... I felt that Glendon did have some very valuable insights into the role of parenting. But...I never got the impression that she respected her ownparents. She patted herself on the back about how great she was. So... I thought Glennon shared some useful tips about parenting from morality rather than kids accomplishments in the outside world.However, every time Glennon moved away from ‘sharing’ her experiences -and started preaching her views - I lost total respect for her. Glennon is ‘not’ a talented compassionate INSPIRATIONAL or SPIRITUAL leader...Her lack of empathy and appropriate speaking skills fell apart. I spent a couple of days trying to figure out what it was that she did that DROVE ME NUTS....She was self serving and annoying in her ME FIRST Philosophy. Too much swinging-that pendulum with her good girl/ bad girl themes. ...Glennon is a recovered alcoholic-...A recovered bulimic-...A girl who had destroyed all her relationships at one time as well.I’m happy Glennon found her own voice - and did some repair work - learned to look inward at her own needs and desires - rather than self harm herself. BUT...I was incredibly embarrassed by many things she said - and the tone in which she said them. Even her words about being a feminist were cringe-shaking off the wall. RIGHTEOUS is as RIGHTEOUS is!!! ( yuck)It was her ASSUMPTION that most woman were just like her - Only focusing on makeup-clothes- getting others to love ‘us’... Glennon Doyle crossed the line into PUSHING HER RIGHTEOUSNESS on others. One minute she talked about nurturing relationships and the next minute she slammed any person who called her on the telephone or sent her a text message for the gall of interrupting her life. My God then she compared the last presidential race to the apocalypse. What the hell? I think this is the last book I ever plan to read by Glennon Doyle.She’s not Eckhart Tolle, Brené Brown, Lama Surya Das, or Don Miguel Ruiz....This is a MEMOIR — that bordered closely to PREACHING! Glennon Doyle is a woman who took many years to find her own voice.... years of healing from self harm - harming others as well. She still has a few loose marbles about the totality of humanity.....I don’t want to live inside her ‘ME FIRST’ bubble. There are many shades of gray. Life is not all black or white - as Glennon would have us to believe. She was down right mean to people who asked her questions. Glennon Doyle is not a person I trust to teach me HOW TO BE A POWERFUL WOMEN!2.5 stars - rating down.","Elitist DrivelFor those looking for an old school rant review, today is your lucky day.I have so many thoughts and words floating through my head right now that I am struggling to formulate a review - which almost never happens.   In fact, speaking of ""struggle...""This book was a struggle to get through. And I have a feeling it matches the struggle of being Glennon Doyle and living inside Glennon's Doyle's head - ALL of which is created and meticulously curated by Glennon Doyle. Seriously though, she is the driver of her own self-mechanized Struggle Bus, yet acts like she has overcome monumental life suffering derived from forces outside her own damn self. But I will come back to that. First, I want to say (before I forget to do so) that I was really looking forward to reading this. The blurb sounded awesome. A former Christian mommy-blogger who reinvents herself upon meeting and falling in love with a woman? Sign me up. Key word there, though: INVENTS. Because hardly anything about this book felt authentic. In fact, this book felt like nothing more than an elitist American white woman (who has never truly suffered from anything more than low self-esteem) attempting to prove how ""woke"" she is because, hey, she's a lesbian now, yo, and just rocking life so much better than you. For the first 50 pages, she had me totally on board and I was enjoying her story and her message. But then the completely self-righteous (and yet wholly indeterminate) lecturing about every buzz-word topic on the planet started. Motherhood? Racism? Feminism? Toxic masculinity? The dangers of technology and its effects on mindfulness? Step aside, peons, because Glennon Doyle has this shit ALL figured out. And she will tell you all about it. Because she gets it more than you. The fact that she - a grown ass middle/upper class married American woman with three children - didn't even know how to buy her own plane ticket? Irrelevant. She still adults SO much better than you. Because she trusts her ""knowing."" And because I do what I want, losers.  And don't get even get me started on how much she contradicts herself and makes her complete hypocrisy blatantly obvious whilst still lecturing us all on how we should be doing things. In one chapter, she talks about how she was a ""good parent"" to her first daughter, but then ""got tired....[and] by the time [her third child] exited the birth canal, [she] just handed her an iPad and wished the child godspeed on her journey."" She talks about how this made her third child SO #independent and confident in who she is...and then turns around and talks about how she decided to take her son's cell phone away because it was stifling his ""creativity"" and causing him to withdraw from life. She, of course, includes the whole conversation she later had with her son (her firstborn) about taking away said cell phone...a conversation in which she, of course, sounds like a mage-mother with woke mom skills. Because, you know, #stillbetterthanyou. And while on the topic of phones...she later discusses how her friend Erika called her cell phone. Poor Erika. ""Recently, my friend Erika called my cell phone. I will never understand why people insist upon calling my cell phone. It's such an aggressive action to take: calling someone. Each time my phone rings, I have a heart attack like my pocket's on fire and a tiny siren is going off.""
 Wow.  I have no words. That quote basically encompasses so much about this woman. She is so sensitive, she is ""damaged"" by her friend calling her, you know, to be a FRIEND. And she prefers texts, but doesn't answer them, because (again) I do what I want and refuse to be a part of your damned patriarchy. But here is your iPad, sweetie. She is also so damned sensitive and ""empathetic"" that she RECENTLY became so tired, hungry, and concerned while watching Survivorman on TV that her wife had to remind her that, don't worry, he would be okay. Because TELEVISION. And PRODUCTION TEAM. And I am supposed to give a fuck what this woman thinks about real world issues?   Nope. I would continue to include more contradictory quotes and stories - of which there are MANY. But I just can't be bothered to think or talk about this woman and her book one second longer. In fact, the minute I finish this review, both this book and my thoughts about it are headed for the bin.Because I can do what I want too.","Did you hear choo choo sound of disappointment train! Yes, I heard it, I’ve been there, done that! And can you feel the approaching steps of “unpopular review”: yes, it’s coming right now…One step, two step, three step: And here we are: I’m about to give two stars one of the books inspired and got so many great reviews from the readers. I wish I could be one of them. I wish I could carry a happy smile after reading this memoir and clap my hands to show my devotion and respect to the author. Nope, it’s not gonna happen!Firstly: I felt like I turned myself into a Foucault Pendulum because my feelings kept swinging between love and hate. I didn’t have so many negative and positive reactions to a book at the same time. But unfortunately negativity defeated the power of positive thoughts. The beginning of the book was so promising: Glennon is strong woman: recovered alcoholic, bulimic, humanitarian, activist, wife and mother of three falls in love. At the first time in her life she knows the other person is the one: somebody truly stole her heart and finding your soulmate is just a start for her self-discovery and the beginning of self-journey.I don’t have any problem about Glennon’s life choices and thoughts because I always show respect people’s decisions about their own lives even though I don't like those decisions. But sometimes putting someone’s needs before your own doesn’t mean you’re sacrificing yourself or you’re martyr of your damned path you chose for yourself. It means GIVING and SHARING. There is thin line between respecting yourself by choosing your own needs and being shellfish by always putting your own needs before someone else’s. In this book: I didn’t like the way of Glennon’s treatment to her loved ones and I found her tone harsh, self-righteous and close to be narcissist. When I’m reading the pages I feel like Taylor Swift’s “Me! Me! Me!” was playing over and over in my head.  At some parts way of telling her evolving life story was irritating. I just visualized her as a religious leader who thinks her devoted fans, worshippers may start to scream “Amen” for each word comes out her mouth because she just drew a portrait of herself similar to this vision At that part 80’s Madonna’s popular song started playing in my head with my alternated version; “ Glennon, don’t preach, I’m in trouble deep, Glennon, don’t preach I’ve been losing sleep.”I am so happy her journey resulted well for her and she finally found her true happiness but her ways to earn that freedom in expanse to hurt the loved ones around her and the way of justifying her actions like “Her way or high way” kind of know-it-all communication style didn’t work well for me. Sorry that’s not the inspirational story I’ve been looking for maybe that’s about my character and the way of looking to the matters are quite opposite. I can accept the opposite opinions but that doesn’t mean they’re the right ones. There are so many different approaches and so many different angles of the reality. I know Glennon doesn’t give any shit my opinion and anyone disagrees her meaningful, full of wisdom thoughts of hers. But I still write, express and tell how I feel. Sorry, it seems like I’m not the right reader for this journey!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
Don't Believe Everything You Think,Joseph  Nguyen,3.79,"So I saw the author on TikTok and how short & well rated the book was so bought on a whim & read in a sitting. As an active reader of the genre, I take no issue with the points of the book. However, the book is terribly written. It’s an immature tone, the personal anecdotes ruin timeless insights, there are jumps in logic that aren’t addressed until later “chapters,” I can’t shake the thought that this book was written entirely in “speech to text” as if it were meant to be a performed script…this booked needed a better editor. Highly recommend the Michael Singer podcast, his book “The Untethered Soul”, Ekhart Tolle’s books, “Wherever you go there you are” instead and the Sam Harris podcast.","I picked this book thinking it would be backed by a psychological or scientific approach, I would never have picked if i had known that i would see words like 'Universal mind / consciousness', 'Infinite intelligence', 'Universe guides you' that stuffs all those spiritual bs and pantheistic notions upon the reader's throat. It's a 100 page read so i went on to complete it anyway. To be clear the book offers a basic solution to have a better life - 'Be dumb'. It's like saying do you need to solve your problems ? Stop thinking duh ! Weirdly remembered me of that meme where a sad person gets offered a reply 'Don't be sad' and he goes like 'My goodness what an idea, why didn't i think of that'. The book is a mixture of the diluted version of 'Law of attraction'/ 'Secret' and spiritually modified version of 'Thinking fast and slow'. If you think the sentence 'Universe / god / infinite intelligence is guiding you' makes perfect sense to you and you feel significant enough that the universe itself is somehow caring for you then you should definitely go for this book.P.S: i also searched about the 'non-thinking' state the book says and came up with a condition called 'Blank mind syndrome' which can be caused by trauma or depersonalisation.","Don't Believe Everything You Think is a book with its heart in the right place, but its mind is elsewhere. In roughly 100 pages, Nguyen spells out a simple thesis: Our thinking is the root of our suffering. To avoid suffering, don't think. The problem is not that this thesis is simple; it's that it is simplistic. The author never really develops a cogent argument in its favor, nor does he fully equip the reader with the tools to put his suggestions into practice.To be fair, the author is not completely off the mark. The idea that the rambling of our inner voices might be the source of our emotional troubles goes back at least thousands of years, appearing in one form or another in a wide variety of philosophies, from Buddhism to Taoism, Transcendentalism to the New Age. Even Shakespeare's melancholy Dane recognizes it in Act II, Scene 2, of Hamlet. The author acknowledges this long history chiefly in the form of chapter-starting epigraphs. The main text of these chapters, however, is big on promises (""This book was written to help you find everything you've been searching for and the answers to all the questions you've had your entire life."") but light on evidence (a few thought experiments, which is a bit ironic).The main idea itself has more than a little truth to it. Many if not all of us have had the experience of disappearing down a mental rabbit hole, imagining arguments that never occurred, insults that were never thrown at us, catastrophes that never happened, and every other brand of mental noise that might come up. To the author's credit, he distinguishes between unbidden thoughts and indulging them by thinking. This is very much in line with the Buddhist practice of mindfulness: The thoughts will come on their own, but we need to be mindful of our taking the bait and ruminating on them. There is some scientific support for this idea. Killingsworth and Gilbert [1] polled thousands of subjects at random points during the day to explore their activities and moods, finding that people whose minds were wandering had significantly lower moods than people who were focused on a task. Of course, like just about every published piece of psychological research, other work disagrees with this conclusion, showing instead positive effects of mind wandering [2]. The current scientific view is equivocal [3]: Sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's bad.I am reluctant to criticize an obviously well-meaning, self-published author for deficits in the writing, but this is a short book that still feels padded and poorly edited. Beyond the distracting typos, the entire message the author has could have been contained within several pages, and nothing is added by stretching it out to book length. The biggest disappointment, though, is that there is a rich vein of material on this topic, both scientific and philosophical, that could have easily filled a book several times this one's length while maintaining essentially the same core message. Instead, the author delves into woo territory by claiming that our spontaneous thoughts are ""divine downloads from the Universe,"" messages from God or the Great Beyond, as opposed to the product of the deeply mysterious but no less fascinating activity of the human brain. This pseudoreligious, New-Agey turn wound up being even more distracting to me than the editing.The potential reader can get nearly everything this book has to offer from its final pages (99–119 in my edition). While the book itself is a bit of a disappointment, one would be rash to completely discard its cautions against letting our minds run away with us all the time. But the solution to a hard problem—whether it's resolving a dilemma, tackling a scientific mystery, or writing a book–requires not just waiting for inspiration from beyond but actual sustained thought. The question then becomes one of when to turn the crank and when to let go, and the take-home point may be to let go far more often than we want to.[1] Killingsworth, M. A., & Gilbert, D. T. (2010).

The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,Brianna Wiest,4.07,"Oh, I REALLY wanted to love this. I instantly ordered it after hearing a reviewer on booktok say “this book would have changed my life if I read it in my 20s”. Ok sign me up.... but no. Unfortunately it seemed very similar to the issues I have with poetry and Rupi Kaur’s work, it seemed to be written purely to be posted or quoted on Instagram. That’s what this book was, even down to the formatting (and lack of proper paragraphs, repetitive and generic quotations printed with the intention of relating to a wide array of people on the internet. It didn’t seem genuine unfortunately. I feel like this book had a lot of words but didn’t really actually say anything. Sorry booktok, you let me down!!","I have a bachelor degree in psychology and i work with people living with eating disorders. I figured I'd pick up this book to help with certain patterns and behaviours I've noticed through my professional experiences. I was highly disappointed. It didn't help that I saw this book glorified on TikTok because it set my expectations way too high.From what I've gathered online, Wiest is a writer and a poet. She seems to have no education or training on psychology or therapy (I couldn't find anything on that). I found that her facts were a little shaky and looking through her references, I could see why. There's 24 references in total for her whole book and very few are scientific articles. Some of it is from psycho-pop online articles and there's even one reference from a LinkedIn post. I believe she based most of her observations on experience, this is not to be diminished, but the book lacked scientific support.Overall, the tools and strategies she gave were fine. I actually have a few pages with post-its on them. There's some parts of the book that felt empty as if the words were to fill the chapter instead of giving substance. The first two parts were the most helpful to understand self-sabotage and learn about unhealthy patterns of behaviours. The rest was a little repetitive and more inspirational than resourceful. I won't recommend this book to people who go through self-sabotage tendencies. I believe that good old therapy works best and that there exists other self-help books that are way more scientifically approved. I recommend The Happiness Trap by Dr. Harris to change your perspective on life instead of this one.Also, there's mentions encouraging diet culture when it is in no way relating to the subject. Eating fast food is not ""self-sabotage"". It can be part of a balanced diet when you work on your perspective over food and then adjust your behaviours to fulfill your needs (biological and emotional).","Right words at the right timeWhen I read self help type books, I'll highlight if I come across something that rings true. I'll use a second stronger color if it provides insight or a new path I hadn't seen/thought of before, or that I had forgotten. I think I may have marked more of this book than not. Due to the nature of books on self, it's hard to say whether I would recommend this book to you. If you are looking for someone else to provide answers, this isn't the book. This is more like a quiet voice in your ear helping to give you new places to look inside for those answers.You can find the author's work on Medium if you want a good sampling of her voice/style. It's what led me here. Hope this helps."
The Creative Act: A Way of Being,Rick Rubin,4.00,"I heard Jacob Collier say ""I don't believe [Rick Rubin's] audience is creative people. I think his audience is people who aren't creative, for whom creativity is novel"" and now my entire perception of this book is refracted through that lensSome great one-liners but this reads like a book of quotes and quips with padding around them, and suggests one specific way to be 'creative'. Any truly, innately creative person would not confine themselves to this ideology, and so emerges two different types of people: those who are creative by nature and those who believe creativity is frivolous, the antithesis of work. By pandering to the latter, this unfortunately fails to provide much useful advice. There's a definite disconnect between creative people and the target audience for this book, The Creative Act.","For such a beautiful and thick book, the content is surprisingly empty. The chapters are each 2-4 pages and between each one is a one or two line snippet, an ersatz proverb about creativity. For example, I opened a random page and the only text reads, “Sometimes disengaging is the best way to engage.” A lot of the advice is kind of eye-rolling and obvious, like it wants to be a Buddhist text so bad. But it’s not all bad. If you’re down on yourself about creating, I can see it being helpful to flip open to a random page and really remind yourself that creation is a holistic process that ebbs and flows. I would recommend Rob Walker’s The Art of Noticing for more practical advice about getting out of a creative rut while you enjoy this one’s pep-talk to your spirit.","absolutely insufferable. ""my appendix burst but then I flipped a book by a medical quack open to a random page and it said not to get your body parts removed so I still have my appendix"" yeah ok buddy. Skeevy vibes abound. Gave the impression of a man who has been incredibly lucky and now thinks he is a creative prophet. If you can make it through the nauseating, crunchy granola word salad, you might find a few nuggets but I promise you it's nothing you can't find by simply logging on to Pinterest."
Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals,Oliver Burkeman,4.20,"A lovely and short book that I listened to the author read as an audiobook.The last chapter and appendix contained some tips that I wanted to remember, so I wrote them down here. Some of it are quotations from other authors, but that wasn't as clear when listening. Sorry other authors!5 Questions:1. Choose uncomfortable enlargement over comfortable diminishment.2. Are you holding yourself to or judging yourself by impossible standards? Drop them.3. In what ways have you yet failed to accept the fact that you're who you are and not the person you think you ought to be? No one really cares what we're doing with our life. There's no need to justify your life.4. In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you're doing? Everyone's just winging it, you might as well get on with it.5. How would you spend your days differently if you didn't care so much about seeing your action reach fruition?""One lives as one can. ... The individual path is the way you make for yourself, which is never prescribed, which you do not know in advance and which simply comes into being itself when you put one foot in front of the other. ... Quietly do the next and most necessary thing."" - Carl JungTen tools for embracing your finitude:1. Adopt a fixed-volume approach to productivity. e.g. Keep two to-do lists one that contains everything you want to do, and a second which contains things you're actively working on, which should be limited to a small number of items (at most ten). Or, establish time limits for your daily work.2. Serialize! Focus on one big project at a time and see it to completion before moving on.3. Decide in advance what to fail at. Accept that you'll do a poor job at things which you aren't currently focusing on, and that should diminish the shame of failing.4. Focus on what you've already completed, not just on what's left to complete. Celebrate your daily achievements, since you'll never finish everything that's left. Keep a ""done"" list of what you've completed in the day.5. Consolidate your caring. There are lots of problems in the world, but you only have a finite amount of attention. Pick a few causes and work towards them.6. Embrace boring and single-purpose technology. Make your devices as boring as possible: delete social-media apps and switch your devices to grayscale. Read on a kindle instead of your phone.7. Seek out novelty in the mundane. Avoid routines when possible, walk a new way, etc. Experience each moment in greater detail, pay more attention.8. Be a researcher in relationships. Adopt an attitude of curiosity in which your goal isn't to achieve any particular outcome or successfully explain your position, but ""to figure out who this human being is."" Curiosity is satisfied regardless of the outcome. Choose wonder over worry whenever you can.9. Cultivate instantaneous generosity. Whenever a generous impulse arises in your mind, act on it right away. Don't wait until later when you can ""do a better job.""10. Practice doing nothing. Stop trying to evade how reality feels, calm down and make better choices with your time.","First of all, this is probably not the book you think it is, and that’s a good thing. Rather than offering cheap “time hacks” to get more of the same bullshit done, this more philosophical work is based on two important but uncomfortable truths: (1) In the short 4,000 or so weeks you have to live, you will never be able to accomplish all the things you would like, and (2) even if you could, it wouldn’t matter in the end because, in the words of John Maynard Keynes, “In the long run we are all dead.” This is not the most uplifting message you will ever read, but it is liberating and possibly even life-changing. When you stop trying to get an impossible amount of work done in pursuit of accomplishments that won’t really matter once you’re gone, you can start spending the short amount of time you do have pursuing things you enjoy for their own sake in the present moment. However you decide to spend your life—and regardless of whatever fame or fortune (or not) it brings—it should be spent on things that have intrinsic value to you and not for the sake of some destination or outcome that you think will eventually make you happy. If you can’t find a way to be happy now, at this moment, you probably never will be, no matter how many to-do items you cross off your list. One obvious criticism of this somewhat apathetic approach to time management is that, if nothing really matters in the end, there’s no longer any motivation to pursue worthwhile social initiatives. I think this could be a real challenge to Burkeman’s philosophy. Where would the civil rights movement be, for example, if someone like Martin Luther King Jr. said, “In the long run we are all dead”? Certainly it is the case that some people derive more joy and life satisfaction from pursuing projects that they do feel are worthwhile and that the outcome justifies the massive amount of work and unpleasantness required for its actualization. In situations like this, I’m not sure how well the ideas in this book will resonate. There’s also a bit of repetition throughout the book as Burkeman repeats the main ideas I’ve described above, although he does also cover a lot of interesting philosophical ground. Overall, the book won’t be for everyone, especially for those who remain under the illusion that they will accomplish everything they want to if only they had better “time management skills.” But for those who get the main message—the idea that we should pursue the activities we intrinsically enjoy while accepting our finitude and committing to what’s most important (i.e., not material wealth or fame)—this may be one of the most enjoyable and potentially life-altering books they will read this year.",1. Could have been condensed into an article2. Just read Ecclesiastes or a stoic and you’ll get the point3. Had one good point: embrace what you’re doing and acknowledge that you won’t be able to do anything else in that moment.
Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity,"Peter Attia, Bill Gifford",4.35,"1. There are no footnotes in the body of the text. The reader has to guess there will be a note, turn to the back of the book and search the note section by page number and then by the sentence to see if there is one. Weird, especially considering how Attia tries to emphasis his reliance on science and numbers. 2. The actual important/useable information could have been distilled down to a 20-30 page pamphlet with footnotes to relevant studies. The rest is anecdotes, analogies and Attia’s personal opinions. 3. The book is not formatted in a way where the usable info is easy to spot and go back to for later reference. It sucks having to wade through 400 pages of fluff material.4. The final section on emotional health is about Attia’s struggle to overcome being an asshole that segues in to a mention of DBT as a way to make this section fit in to the book. Yet, if Attia had just written a book on this topic alone and the research and data behind the treatment and success rates, it would be an excellent book. 5. There is no information in the book that can’t easily be found online for free. 6. The book feels like it was written initially as a stream of thought and someone else was tasked to edit it in to some kind of organized format. 7. Attia’s reliance on extreme monitoring of his patients bloodwork, glucose, etc feels like a grift. If you run enough tests on people you will eventually find some result outside the range of “normal”. That doesn’t mean anything is wrong. His assumption that if lowering a value to x is good, then x/2 must be better could actually be quite wrong. 8. Attia mentions centenarians but never seems to address the fact that these people lived to these ages without the kind of extreme monitoring or regimens he proposes. This issue is probably the one that is my deal breaker with all longevity experts. My grandparents lived to 90, 102, 100 and 96. Some smoked, some drank, none ran, none lifted weights and none went to therapy. One was even in the Bikini Islands within the strike zone for the Castle Project explosions. I have to believe a huge part of their longevity is due to genes. Which ones? Who knows. So what parts of their environment was the other factors that lead to their longevity?Instead of focusing on making people guinea pigs of what ones hopes are longevity regimens, perhaps a better focus would be on super seniors and researching what about them genetically, their diets or their habits is setting them apart from the average.","This book was written by men, for men.Let me explain...And this will be long, because I felt like this book had so much potential.1. The author should have started the book with his mental health story. Literally, the last chapter he starts to talk about the fixed mindset versus the growth mindset (without using those terms exactly), but that should be topic #1. You literally cannot proceed, if you have a fixed mindset.2. This author could benefit from reading the book Invisible Women. He references many studies and statistics, but it is well known that women are very underrepresented in those statistics. He talks about, what he calls, ""Healthcare 2.0 vs. Healthcare 3.0"". Healthcare 3.0 is supposed to take the patient, as an individual, into consideration. We cannot apply statistics to women, if those statistics do not involve women. Another topic that is harmful for women, is dieting. He suggests calorie cutting and fasting, although he does say it's not for everyone. I think he just doesn't understand how harmful those topics are, especially to young women who have probably been using calorie counting apps since they first learned how to download an app.3. He suggests way too many medications. In fact, he starts suggesting medications before we even get to the chapters on food. If anything, food recommendations should be listed prior to medications. I'm specifically referring to the section where he talks about using drugs to lower ApoB levels. A quick Google search told me; fatty fish, legumes and plant protein, olive oil, and minimally processed fiber-rich sources of carbs could help lower ApoB levels. All of those foods are also listed in The Mediterranean Diet, which is the most highly recommended diet for a reason.4. I work in Oncology, so for the chapter on Cancer, I would have talked about beauty and household products. Many of the foods we eat have carcinogens, but also our beauty products, our clothes, our household products. We are basically in a giant fishbowl of carcinogens. I use apps like Yuka, Bobby Approved, and Healthy Living to scan products before I buy them.5. He talks about how exercise can help with our breathing and then mentions meditation at the very end of the book when he is talking about mental health. Meditation can also be a good way to manage our breathing. A lot of these topics go hand and hand, so the way this book is structured is a little all over the place.6.Protein is important, but not at the cost of fiber and other nutrients. This is one of the reasons I could tell this book was written by a man. Men push protein so hard, because of the suggestion that it helps improve muscle mass(just another form of toxic masculinity). Colon cancer is on the rise in young people, because we are being told to eat more protein and less carbs. The lack of fiber in our diets is the main cause, but protein can be very filling. If you're eating it in excess, you might not be hungry enough to eat your fiber rich foods. As my nutrition professor would say ""everything in moderation"".7. Also, he never mentions Blue Zones... not once. Which I find extremely odd, seeing this is a book about longevity. Episode 4 of the show Down to Earth, talks about the blue zone of Sardinia. They actually found that the people there had a high carb, low protein diet. They also walked a lot more than the average American, and they made all of their ""carbs"" from real ingredients, from scratch. The issue with carbs in America, is much more a testament to the American food industry, but I digress. Having traveled to Italy myself, I can tell that the walking alone would definitely improve my health over time. 8. Unfortunately for this author, and for many men in general, he grew up with toxic masculinity which negatively impacted his mental health. I think he has come a long way, from what he has said in his chapter on mental health, but I could tell he is still learning. There is a lot of unconscious bias spread throughout this entire book and it only became more obvious in his chapters on exercise and nutrition. He basically tells us, the entire first half of the book that his ""Healthcare 3.0"" is not a one-size fits all solution. That he tailors it to fit his patients unique needs. Yet, the chapters on fitness and food are very specific instructions. He even says, if you find yourself disagreeing with what he says to ""stop overthinking nutrition so much, hit pause on the audio-bo0k, go outside and get some exercise"" (I was listening to the audiobook so I'm not sure what the physical book says). He also states that this book started as a diet and exercise guide for a friend and that makes so much sense. No wonder his ""Healthcare 3.0"" feels very ""one-size-fits-all"".In conclusion, I do think there are a lot of important topics covered in this book and if you are a really unhealth person, you could find this book beneficial. If you are already a healthy person, this book was probably nothing new for you. I really liked the first half of this book, I felt he started to lose me once he got to exercise and nutrition. I also think he could have benefitted from a more feminine POV.2025 Update: since this review decided to take off!I still believe this is a good book if you are living an unhealthy lifestyle or you are a man. If you are already a semi-healthy person, this book will be a waste of your time. My biggest take away from this book was his future-forward thinking. By that I mean, if you want to be running marathons when you're 60, you need to be running marathons now. Whatever you imagine your life to look like in the future, you have to be doing that times ten now. So many of us put work first with the expectation of retiring at 60 and traveling the world... that won't happen if your body cannot endure traveling. That was basically the moral of the story, and seeing as how I have discouraged some people from reading it, I wanted to make sure they still received that one good piece of advice.","This book has sections that contain invaluable information. But as a book it's 5x too long.I saw this line in the acknowledgments section:""my then publisher said my draft was too technical and lacked any sense of me as a person and my own journey to understanding the importance of longevity.""I wish publishers would stop this approach. Non-fiction books don't need a hero's journey. Often readers simply want the information. Adding a narrative just dilutes and prolongs the book."
Get Out of Your Head: Stopping the Spiral of Toxic Thoughts,Jennie Allen,4.07,"I really, REALLY tried to finish this book, and I did make it 2/3 of the way. Local friends chose it for book club, and met weekly to discuss each chapter. But it slowly became an unbearable source of frustration and annoyance to me, so I finally dropped it.Here’s a paragraph that exemplifies my two biggest problems with it: ————————————————————————I recently posted on Instagram this quote often attributed to Andrew Murray: “Humility is perfect quietness of heart.... It is to expect nothing, to wonder at nothing that is done to me, to feel nothing done against me. It is to be at rest when nobody praises me and when I am blamed or despised. It is to have a blessed home in the Lord, where I can go in and shut the door, and kneel to my Father in secret, and am at peace, as in a deep sea of calmness, when all around and above is trouble.”The comments in response to this post were priceless: “Wow. This is difficult. “How rare.”“Whoa. That hurts. “———————————————————————-1 Does she really need to bookend a quote by referring to her social media following?!? The entire book is chock full of her American lifestyle, her family stories, and her personal experiences, though they usually seemed barely related to the content. I think she intended to be vulnerable and relatable to the reader but it was frustrating to me, who does not relate to her, and doesn’t read personal growth books because I want a hug. I want concise, solid, and well-studied content. I want a book written by a successful expert in the field, not a well-meaning blogger. Which brings me to my next point.2 That quote on humility. That is not what humility is. It’s twisting the meaning of words to make a point. That happens in every single chapter. I had red flags going off constantly and it made it extremely difficult to pick out the bones in my search for good content. The book is not founded on Biblical principles or on psychology, though she does use both to support her points. The book is based on an idea that hit her as she was running. The idea is fine, but there is a definite lack of depth or actual experience here. It feels like an extrovert rambling about an idea they had after watching a TEDx talk.... which is exactly what it is.Maybe I’m being unfair. This book is exactly what it’s meant to be, a pop-Christian self-help book written by an ‘influencer’ with a following. Most of the ladies in my book club loved it, and I think most middle class American women will - the references to Starbucks, scrolling on social media, and Netflix binging are right up their alley and are included abundantly to cater to them. It was overwhelmingly cringy to me, but I realize I’m in the minority. The points of the book are fine, even if the delivery gave me an eye twitch. If you’re wanting a meaty deep-dive into challenging and changing your thought-life, I HIGHLY recommend Telling Yourself the Truth by William Backus and Marie Chapian. I started it soon after I started this one and it is written by experienced and knowledgeable psychologists and counselors and based on Biblical principles. It’s been extremely challenging and eye-opening and I’m actively applying it to my thought-life and helping my children through the principles as well.","I wanted to really like this book. The premise resonated with me. However, in the end, it wasn't what I was expecting. While the author acknowledges at one point about differing personalities (she being an enneagram ""7"" and her sister being a ""6"" and introvert v. extrovert), it feels like the suggestions offered are more of the one-size-fits-all variety. I also had a tough time following the organization of the book, this could be due to the e-book formatting. She uses graphics of spirals, but didn't really walk through how the spiral matched with the chapter. I think what I was really looking for was in Part 3 of the book. By then, though, I was skimming. I will potentially go back and read that portion again. All in all, I think some people will really like this book. But, for some, like myself, it will be hard to relate. This is written from the point-of-view of a very energetic (enneagram 7) author who had an 18 month bout of anxiety. It's not written with the understanding that some face some degrees of these anxious thoughts as their daily norm. I received an Advanced Reader Copy of this book via NetGalley.","This book was even better than I thought. I have read a lot on neuroscience and a lot on neuroscience combined with scripture, But I really found helpful the lies or negative thoughts she would state and the truths and ways to turn the downward spirals around. Even if you are not someone depressed or anxious there are other big thoughts in this book that will bring conviction with hope and a roadmap to change. I’ve enjoyed listening to the podcasts that go along with each of the chapters and will be released when the book releases. Some of my favorite quotes:«But in Christ we can fight not from a place of insecurity and outrage but from a place of reconciliation. Of calm confidence. Of peace. Of love. Why? Because our victory is sure. We’ve already won» (Get Out of Your Head, Jennie Allen). PocketBook Reader«The way of Jesus shifts everything. In Jesus, we can acknowledge our frustration, pain, and suffering without abdicating our peace and joy. In Jesus, we can change where we fight from without changing what we fight for.

The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness,Eric Jorgenson,4.42,"I will tell you an anecdote before going into the review. In India, IITs are the premier technical institutions with around 1% acceptance rate and .1% for the top 1000 ranks. Kids can become minor celebrities in their circles just by clearing the exam - which is no easy feat. With launch of Quora, I came across several such cringey questions related to people who got into IIT. They hadn't achieved a lot in life till then.Coming to the book, Naval Ravikant seems like a person who has made it. He didn't have the privilege of money growing up and success has been built by hard work and persistence. But there are hundreds of thousands of such individuals in the world. There is nothing that stands out from this almanac about him. Naval's accomplishment seems to be that he ""invested in Uber in 2014"". Couple this with the cringey foreword by one of Naval's friend/associate (""maybe Naval will name his kid after me if I write this foreword"", you are almost immediately put off. But the book has high ratings and is free, so you soldier on.Of course the ""book"" is free, since it is not a book at all. Eric Jorgenson has done a half-assed job of compiling lectures/tweets etc into a meaningful book. He didn't go deeply into the topics discussed to understand the motivations of the person saying those things, questioned him or drilled down to the core underlying values. Hence it seems more like an overtly long blog based on random things a person said on twitter. It suffers from continuity and structure. Coming to the content itself, one of Naval's philosophy is to ""productize yourself"". Which actually clears the intention of why this almanac came out, he is productizing himself. Maybe he wants to build a brand of himself as a motivational speaker, personal coach, mentor or whatever. Naval does not shy away from sensational quotes - ""99% of effort is wasted"". And then goes on and on about how it, the quote, is actually not true, how it is true in a specific context and then ends with ""focus your effort on 1% that matters"" - maybe he could have started with that. Sadly (or fortunately?), with advent of social media platforms, this is the age of celebrity culture - where it is very easy to become minor twitter celebrities and thinking how you have become successful/wealthy in life, you become fit (in your opinion) to dole out philosophy on everything - even around happiness and keto diet - when you don't really have qualifications in that area.I didn't get anything from the book. Rehashing well known things - ""make your money work for you while you sleep"" with some terms like ""leverage"" and ""specific knowledge"" does not cut for philosophy or key insights.","I really love this book. 😍It made me reread the words and challenge my mind to understand the meanings.It's like a conversation about how to live a happy and successful life.Work for yourself, not for time: Owning a business or creating something is better than just trading your time for money.Make good choices in life.The book is full of interesting ideas that will make you think about how you want to live your life.I will treasure this book and revisit its pages time and again. Its wisdom has already made a profound impact on me.","I cannot believe how great this book is. I was familiar with Naval through Tools of Titans, but reading this showed that he is so much more than a few pages - no matter how well written - can capture.This book is bound to be a classic, and the fact that Eric and Naval collaborated to release this for FREE, is amazing. For more social proof, Tim Ferriss even broke his iron rule of No Forewords to write the foreword to this book. There is no excuse for not picking this book up. There is something in it for everyone, and it's worth reflecting over."
Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,James Clear,4.33,"A Book That Changed My LifeA book worth reading once a year. In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2025 Reading ScheduleJan	A Town Like AliceFeb	BirdsongMar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr	War and PeaceMay	The Woman in WhiteJun	AtonementJul	The Shadow of the WindAug	Jude the ObscureSep	UlyssesOct	Vanity FairNov	A Fine BalanceDec	GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta My Bookstore at Pango","“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

 What a doozy of a quote. I guess it pays to be a prideful guy. Well, it seems luck isn't on my side when it comes to personal development reads, and ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is no exception. Despite the hype surrounding it, I find myself once again let down by a tired, regurgitated pop psychology book that fails to deliver.The information presented feels like a rehash of what I've stumbled upon in the productivity blogosphere for the past decade. But it's not just the lack of freshness that bothers me—it's the execution. The writing feels robotic, the repetition grows tiresome, and the cherry-picked anecdotes conveniently support the author's points, often taken out of context. Even the scientific references feel shaky and questionable at times.While the core ideas explored in ""Atomic Habits"" aren't inherently bad, they've already been covered by other authors with more depth and skill. Writers like Kelly McGonigal and George Leonard come to mind, offering a richer exploration of the subject matter. Frankly, I can't help but feel that the material in this book could have easily been condensed into a blog post or article. Instead, what I encounter is a bloated book filled with unnecessary fluff, making it feel like an extended infomercial for the author's blog. It's evident that this is just another platform to boost his personal brand and generate 'passive income'.I guess the world really needed another privileged marketer with an A-type personality telling people they can become like him if they follow his 'secret formula.' It seems tailor-made for a specific group of individuals—those who aspire to be the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire, like Tim Ferris, and his devoted followers.P.S.I should note that despite my disappointment, I've come across individuals who found value in this book, claiming it transformed their lives. However, in most of those cases, they failed to sustain the new habits they initially adopted and years later it's like they never read the book. While ""Atomic Habits"" didn't meet my personal expectations, it may still hold potential for people who are new to the subject or resonate with the author's approach. And hey, if it floats your boat and makes you feel like the captain of your own destiny, who am I to rain on your parade? Happy reading!","This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick."
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Mark Manson,3.87,"If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.","Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they’re choosing to find important in life and what they’re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?","“Giving too many fucks is bad for you.” The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck ~~~  Mark MansonWhere to begin? Well for starters,  Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than  Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, an old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: ""While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience."" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, “Its the not the Destination, It's the journey.” Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without  Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ..."
How to Win Friends & Influence People,Dale Carnegie,4.22,"This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review.","Dale, saying people's names often when you're talking to them, Dale, doesn't make you popular, Dale, it makes you sound like a patronizing creep.This book is probably really handy when you're trying to befriend kindergarteners, not as much adults. It's also aimed at salespeople and not regular humans.","Three things about this book surprised me and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. One - it seemed pretty much timeless. Not much anachronism here, because language still serves the same purposes as ever, and people still want basically the same things they've always wanted. I liked the examples taken from Abe Lincoln, etc.Two - the techniques described in the book aren't duplicitous. We all try to do what the title says, just like everyone else, whether we're admitting it to ourselves or not. Readers are repeatedly encouraged to develop genuine interest in others, be honest and ethical, and obey the golden rule.Three - I enjoyed it (read twice back to back) and it felt easy and natural to apply some of the ideas in my life. Shortly after reading this book, I was a little bit better at communicating and a little bit happier about my interactions with others in general."
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,"Stephen R. Covey, Jim Collins (Foreward, Contributor)",4.16,"This book explains 7 principles that make a person more effective personally and professionally. Covey shows how a principle-centered, character-based life helps you build the healthy relationships that are key to an effective life. This classic is well worth reading for its perspective and practical advice.ConceptsCorrect Principles: Covey frequently references his Christianity. He says the Habits are based on ""Correct Principles"" (aka Natural Law) found in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and common to major religions.P/PC Balance: Covey says you must maintain a balance between production (P; your output) and production capability (PC; your ability to produce). You must stay healthy and renew yourself (see Habit 7) or you'll get burned out and become ineffective. He uses the fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg as a metaphor.Interdependence: Covey says the Habits lead you from dependence to independence to interdependence (cooperating with others to achieve a common goal; producing things greater than the sum of their parts).The 7 HabitsHabit 1: Be ProactiveYou choose how to respond to what life throws at you. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom to choose. Take responsibility for your actions.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind Choose your short-term, daily behavior according to the plan you have for your entire life. Think about the legacy you want to leave. Put things in perspective; what would you want people to say at your funeral?Habit 3: Put First Things FirstDaily planning is too narrow and short-sighted. Weekly planning gives a better big-picture perspective of your goals, and allows for the flexibility to deal with the things that will inevitably come up.People are more important than things, so plan your time accordingly. Be efficient with things, but effective with people. You can't be efficient with relationships; they take time. Instead of focusing on things and time, focus on relationships and results.Only spend time on things that align with your deep values. Don't waste time on other things, even if it means saying no to requests. Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.Think of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Focus on the important, even though they seem less urgent. Think preventatively to keep tasks from ever becoming urgent.Use stewardship delegation instead of ""gofer"" delegation; teach a person to be the steward of the task you assign to them, rather than constantly telling them to ""go for this"" or ""go for that.""Habit 4: Think Win/WinMost of life requires cooperation, not competition. Work together with co-workers, friends, and family for mutual benefit. Approach everything in terms of ""win/win or no deal""; if you can't reach a deal in which both parties feel they're winning, don't make a deal at all. Create win/win agreements that clearly state expectations, privileges, consequences up front. This prevents you from having to figure those things out when issues arise, and makes the relationship more smooth because it causes each person to manage themselves.Think in terms of the Abundance Mentality rather than the Scarcity Mentality; the quest for recognition, credit, power, and profit isn't a zero-sum game. Be happy when others succeed.Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be UnderstoodListen with the intent to understand, not to reply. Diagnose before you prescribe. Understand needs, concerns, situation before you give advice.To understand others, listen with empathy. To be understood, present your views according to:• ethos: personal credibility• pathos: emotional alignment with the other person• logos: logical reasoningYou can't motivate people by appealing to satisfied needs (money, status, etc.); only unsatisfied needs motivate.Habit 6: Synergize.Value the differences in relationships. Oneness is not sameness, it's complementariness. Unity is not uniformity.Habit 7: Sharpen the SawRenew and improve in yourself in the following categories, by spending at least an hour on each category daily.• Physical: Eat right and exercise.• Spiritual: Find and carry an inner peace. Meditate, read Scripture, or spend time in nature.• Mental: Read good literature to gain the insights of others. Write, organize, and plan.• Social/emotional: Understand others. Serve others, at work or through volunteering.AfterwardCovey says a summary of the first 3 Habits is ""make and keep a promise,"" and a summary of the next 3 Habits is ""involve others in the problem and work out the solution together."" He says the first 3 Habits are about integrity, and the next 3 are about loyalty.","I would like to make clear that David Hasselhoff's appearance in this review should in no way be deemed to imply that I endorse or support his career in any way whatsoever.Thank you for your understanding.
 FIVE ""PRACTICAL"" HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLEFirst, a few comments on the seven so-called “habits” identified in the book, namely:1.Be proactive, 2.Begin with the End in Mind, 3. Put First Things First, 4. Think Win-Win, 5. Seek First to Understand, then to be understood, 6. Synergize, and7. Sharpen the SawIn a word…..crap!! In several words, what a giant, steaming pile of new-age, masturbatory, corp-lingo, platitude spewing bullshit. Think Win-Win…are you kidding me with this Jim Jones Kool-aid party chant? Synergize….just hearing that word makes me throw up in my mouth.Sharpen the saw….exactly…reading that phrase makes me literally want to sharpen the saw and slice a hate filled path through the contents of this book. This book is like a giant fortune cookie full of sounds good but says nothing. My advice: rather than read this book, go get a six pack or a bottle of wine, grab some China Mieville or Dan Simmons and find a nice comfy tree to sit under while you read something that might actually expand your mind. Now I certainly don't have any foolproof answers or magic exercises that will help you bring out the ""inner-winner"" inside you. However, I did come up five pracical (and hopefully a little humorous) habits that have proven to be pretty effective at making people successful in their chosen field (tongue planted firmly in cheek). 1.  EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL SCIENCE TO BECOME THE BEST YOU CAN BE

2. BE BOLD, BE DARING AND DELIVER TO THE MARKETPLACE THE NEXT BIG THING 

3. DON’T BE AFRAID TO USE THE FORCE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOAL

4. GET IN GOOD WITH THE GERMANS

5. BE RUTHLESS PROACTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE COMPETITION

THE END.....","Ever since I worked at the bookstore at Virginia Tech, I would watch the douchebag* business major undergrads buy this book for their classes and look down upon them, and the book by association, as, well, douchebags.*This is not to say that all undergrad business majors are douchebags. I've met one really really awesome one. Additionally, after working at a major university bookstore, a majority of all undergrad students can be fairly classified as douchebags. Jebus.Consequently, I never picked up this book. I hated the people who were reading it for class. I hated the people who were assigning it for their classes. I hated my job and I hated the area that I was living in. (I was, yes indeedy, a hater)Obviously it wasn't the right time for me to read it.My current boss (who is only occasionally a douchebag) is doing this huge self-help/life plan program, and from it, there is a major reading list. As I am a wee bit addicted to books, I immediately agreed, and when I started searching on Amazon for the reading list, ""7 Habits"" appeared on pretty much every single page. So I picked that one up too.Excellent decision. I chose to read it first. It has taken me, probably three weeks to read it. I have ordered (with my boss' blessing) ""The 8th Habit"" and will read that shortly.Every single page I found something that made me put the book down for a couple of minutes and think about it. I already know that I'm going to have to re-read this at some point in the near future. I would say this is required reading for humanity, but my father would have been the exception to that rule.Basically, this book will teach you about effective ways to be a compassionate, kind, enjoyable human being. It will teach you about personal responsibility (personal as in to your self, and to others). It will teach you how to be a better parent, employee, spouse, daughter, or boss. I can't give it enough praise. It is a truly outstanding book."
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Charles Duhigg,4.13,"I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail.","Read this because of fascinating NYT magazine excerpt on how Target tracks our buying habits. The rest of the book is not as compelling -- anecdotes sometimes don't support particular arguments he's attempting to illustrate (the Hey-Ya examples being the most egregious), and his section on how social movements occur is weak and unconvincing, and not really about habits, per se. Style and structure were often clunky, and the book seems a bit muddled as its ultimate purpose. I dunno, I guess I was expecting slightly more substantial psychology or social science and instead got more of a book solidly for businesses/manager types and people on the beginning of their self-help journeys. But I fall into the latter category, so why am I pooh pooh-ing this book so much? I dunno. Maybe I am just jealous of how $$$ money this dude's gonna make at corporate speaking gigs. Anyway, lessons I'll take away -- *making your bed every morning and committing to regular exercise are two habits that can transform your entire goddamn life*Diagram about mouse brain activity spike post-reward eventually arriving prior to reward (the origin of cravings)*Changing habits requires identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support the habit behavior, then trying out various substitutes for the behavior that might achieve the same reward*deliberate advance plans for responding to challenging situations can be extremely helpful (ex Scottish knee/hip replacement patients, Michael Phelps, Starbucks)*With more challenging habits like alcoholism or stuff related to football, true belief and submission to some higher purpose is necessary*in general, it's more effective to change others' habits if you make them believe they have some power or authority over their decision than if you coerce them with force *casinos are super evil","This is great book, and you need to read it. How is that for a definitive opening line? The reason it’s such a good book is because it uses research to explain how habits are formed and changed. Everyone knows someone who was out of shape, or was a smoker, and then in what appeared as if almost overnight, changed themselves in a short period of time. How did they do that? They formed new habits and changed old ones, that’s how.Do something enough and it becomes a habit, good or bad. This is explained in the book by research on memory loss. For example, the research found that patients suffering from memory loss could not show someone where the kitchen is when asked, but once they got hungry the would get up and go to the kitchen automatically.This is made possible by the habit loop of cue, routine, and reward. The cue makes the brain find the routine as it anticipates the reward. A classic example is stress and smoking, the cue is stress, the routine is smoking, the reward is the feeling the cigarette brings.I was most interested in how the book described changing a habit. Let’s face it, we all have habits we want to change. To accomplish this we need to keep the cue and reward, but change the routine. I’ll use an example from my own life to illustrate. I love chocolate, and to make it worse I love to eat at it night. Well I love to eat at night because that is how I formed the habit some time ago. I used the guidance from this book to change that habit. I kept the cue and reward, but I changed the routine to use apples instead of chocolate.This logic flows into much larger problem sets such as organizations and communities. Focus on changing one thing, the keystone habit from which a cascade of other habits will form. The author illustrates this example by discussing how the company Alcoa was transformed by the keystone habit of a singular focus on safety.The book flows really well and uses research throughout to substantiate the concepts presented. The audience who can benefit from this book is vast, from individuals to corporates to governments."
The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,"Miguel Ruiz, Janet Mills (Contributor)",4.19,"This is a small book of 129 pages which I have read it many times. I suspect I will pick it up and read it again for as long as I can read. I don't have it on my bookshelf though, as I want to honor its special nature to me. In my nightstand by my bed is its home for now. This is a book that challenges one to live up to four simple truths, and offers transformational results if one could live a life completely engaged in the four agreements. They are so concise that I can state them here. 1) Be impeccable with your word. 2) Don't take anything personally. 3) Don't make assumptions. 4) Always do your best. Simple huh? Track a day and see how many times you break an agreement (in your actions or your mind). To my constant amazement, I find myself stumbling over one or another of these agreements with some regularity. So it helps to remind myself with a yellow sticky note on my fridge, mental food for when I reach for the physical food. I am not committed to these four agreements with a hope that I will attain some mystical state. I find the author's explanation of how our mind, our society, and importantly, our relationships work to be insightful, even though it is based on a paradigm that is completely outside my heritage of growing up in a small New England town. Understanding the Toltec dream metaphor is an essential part of realizing the deeper meaning driving our relationships within the world around us. Ruiz does a good job of helping these concepts become clearer. Especially relevant to me is the understanding of the role of judging and the resulting self-victimization that society attempts to impress on all of us. Ruiz has helped me drop many of my limited belief structures and has opened up insights into living that are valuable to young and old souls alike. Lately, I have started to sense that some of his intricate explanations of how the dream takes control of our lives are based on a complex analysis that once reasoned through, only makes the simplicity of the four agreements more relevant to me in my daily life.It is 2024, twenty-one years after I wrote this first review. There are only four agreements, but they are a challenge to keep, and I certainly feel my life has improved by striving to keep them actively guiding my life. It is a good read.","I was surprised. I thought I would really like this book. A friend of mine told me the basic ideas were to be impeccable with your word, don't take things personally, don't make assumptions,and always do your best. To me, these sounded great: be honest, be forgiving, give others a chance to say what they think and try your best...or so I thought!The ideas were actually more along the lines of: don't send out poisonous words that put spells on people, don't let others poison you with their spells (pretty strange, right?), don't have expectations of others, and yes, try your best. My husband and I were going to read this together, but by page 16 he couldn't take it anymore! I needed to read it for our book group so I continued on solo. I found the explanations for these ideas unnecessarily described as being from black or white magic, unnecessarily loaded with examples and I felt the author was talking down to me. Also, by far the book's biggest flaw, the information, if it hadn't been so swollen by overexplaining EVERY single concept, could have been presented in half OR LESS of the length!!!! Really, an elementary student might need all the over-simplified explanations supported by numerous examples, but even a teenager would have felt that Ruiz is beating a dead horse! (As my husband and I did by page 16!)Another friend told me that the ideas in this book reminded her of things she's heard before and gave as an example You Are Special, a great children's book by Max Lucado. I suggest reading that instead of this book.The book's ideas felt religious and might be okay for someone who is without religion and looking for some principles to govern their life. But, for me, as a Christian, I felt that these concepts were not only familiar but succinctly summed up in ""love one another"" and ""try to be like Jesus.""I really didn't like the book, but I suppose that I don't have to worry about the author taking it personally! :)","I'd like to propose this book as required reading for the course, Life. Make four simple agreements with yourself and living becomes so much easier, so much lighter:1. Be impeccable with your wordSpeak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.2. Don’t take anything personallyNothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.3. Don’t make assumptionsFind the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.4. Always do your bestYour best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.What I love about this book* It's a short, captivating read. I love the efficiency of receiving so much thought-provocation in so little time.* The agreements are applicable to everyone, everywhere, regardless of religion, gender, age, etc.* Stories, anecdotes and examples from various beliefs are intertwined throughout, spotlighting their common bottom lines: love, life and peace.Possibly the most life-changing book I've ever read. No, really. See?:)"
The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,Marie Kondō,3.88,"There is no rating low enough to compensate for the way this book has ruined my life. Whatever you do, don't read it as it will haunt you. This is a long review but it behooves you to stick with it. To begin, you have to touch each and every possession and ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it doesn't, it needs to be discarded. Do you know how hard it is to summon joy for beige underwear or Neosporin? Yet summon you must. I like my carrot peeler but is joy too strong a word? It gets tougher. Not only must you ""apply hands"" to every piece of clothing while checking for your joy response, you must fold your clothes in very specific ways in order to find each piece's ""sweet spot"". I never knew that ""Every piece of clothing has it's own 'sweet spot' where it feels just right"". This will lead to an historical moment when ""your mind and the piece of clothing connect."" Don't forget to thank your clothes for protecting your body. Thank your accessories for making you beautiful. ""Express your appreciation to every item that supported you during the day.""Never, never ""ball up your socks"" as they can't get their much deserved rest that way. They need to breathe a sigh of relief. You must visit your off season clothes to ""let them know you care and look forward to wearing them when they're next in season. This kind of communication helps your clothes stay vibrant and keeps your relationship with them alive longer.""Everything must be stored standing up rather than laid flat. ""Stacking weakens and exhausts the things that bear the weight of the pile. Just imagine how you would feel if you were forced to carry a heavy load for hours?""You must empty your hand bag every day.""Being packed all the time, even when not in use, must feel something like going to bed with a full stomach."" When you get a new phone, it is kind to text your old one with a message of thanks for its service.Every single thing must be in its assigned place before you go to bed."" Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have no fixed address?"" It is equally important for our possessions to have ""that assurance that there is a place for them to return to.""If we greet our house properly it will "" be happy to tell me what the family no longer needs and where to put the things remaining so that the family can be comfortable and happy in this space."" Not sure if you do this before or after applying hands and checking your joy response. It did come near the end of the book, if that helps.So what do the things that get discarded for not sparking joy feel? ""I think they simply want to leave. Lying forgotten in the closet, they know better than anyone else that they are not bringing you joy."" The people who tidy as this book recommend experience a change in their appearance. ""Their figures are more streamlined, their skin is more radiant, and their eyes shine brighter.""Unfortunately, my eyes are crossed, I've gained 10 pounds, and I feel hives ready to pop. I had no idea when I picked up this pretty little book that it was going to necessitate my search for a live-in psychiatrist. I had NO freaking idea that I was squashing the self-esteem of my possessions. I can NOT find those folding sweet spots and everything in my drawers is in a mosh pit. My hand bag looks sad every time I walk by its nightly fullness. My socks are falling down. I'm not sure why. I hate the word joy now. I'm sleep deprived. My possessions call out to me for help but I don't know if they want me to summon joy or if they want to leave. The other day my husband heard me thanking my underwear for staying up all day. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be married.","How do I get into messes like this? Reading books that have words like ""tidying"" in their title, I mean. Well, there's a story behind it.The Good Wife and I are trying to purge, to clean up after decades of marriage, kids, three moves, etc. ""We've got to do something about all this stuff we keep bumping into or dusting,"" I keep saying, ""something more than the penny ante efforts we're doing so far.""Enter a New York Times feature on THIS book, calling it the greatest thing since sliced sushi:http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/gar...""That does it,"" I told my wife. ""We're both reading this on the Kindle.""""You first,"" she said.I should've known right there. It was kind of like the puppy we picked out 10 years ago. ""He's a little mouthy,"" the guy at the shelter said. You'd think an English major would know foreshadowing when he heard it.Anyway, I'm reading this book and reading this book and saying to myself, ""The Times article IS the book. Free, too! Why am I reading all this filler, this clutter, these words in need of TIDYING up?""That said, I should give the book a star back just for the punch line, ""Does it spark joy?"" It's what you say when holding some up-for-tossing item in your hand. ""Does it spark joy?"" If not, heave and ho, my friends.Just now, I looked around the kitchen with my wife at my side. ""Nothing in here sparks joy...,"" I said.""I'm in the kitchen,"" she replied firmly.""No, no. Stuff, I mean.""Anyway, that's the gist of the book. As for her system, Marie Kondo goes into houses (she does this for a living) and starts her ritual by singing its praises. Then she practices the praise of reduction. She's grateful in her own home, too. For instance, she brings her purse home from work, empties it, puts stuff in its place (fear not, it has a place), then thanks her purse for another job well done. In the morning it all goes back in. Says it extends the life of her purse. You tell me -- ""tidying"" or tidying?Marie also says to congregate everything by category in one spot. Start with clothes. Never room by room where clothes may be found, but ALL clothes from the WHOLE house in ONE spot on the floor (if you have a room big enough, and you don't). Now hold each piece of clothing, one by one. ""Does this spark joy?"" Bzzt.(And that's just the clothes... you still have books, papers, mementos, and personal stuff ahead and in that order.)The only other thing I recall is hanging stuff in the closet. Light clothes (color, material) left, darker and heavier right. That's after you've tossed 87.9% of it.Anyway, my wife is getting cute now. ""Done,"" I said. ""Now you.""""Why don't you tell me the highlights instead,"" she said, already spooked by the ""spark-any-joy?"" talk.""Wha-?""Yep. Just like the former puppy that by now has consumed half the house because he's ""a little mouthy."" Should've seen it coming from the get-go -- the minute I got the ""you first"" line. Bottom line: You can't ""tidy"" a house in ruthless Marie Kondo fashion when you're 40% of a pair (the other 60% having a Security Council Veto, among other super powers). But that's marriage... a very untidy thing.","The book is short and sweet, and the author is bat-shit crazy. But. Here are two take-aways that will stay with me:If it does not spark joy, throw it out.And: ""My basic principle for sorting papers is to throw them all away.""Believe me - I have been throwing away (and selling, and donating to Goodwill) with a vengeance for the past few days, and tidying. I refuse to fold my socks though. Folding socks is for people with all the time in the world."
The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,Eckhart Tolle,4.15,"It would be easy to dismiss this book as a fruit-salad of New Age and pseudo-buddhist clichés, mashed to a fine purée of nonsense and sold as a cure for what ails you in our age of secular alienation. In fact, that is what it is and that is what I'll do. The book opens with what readers of religious texts, the erowid archives and Huxley's The Doors of Perception will recognise as a classic mystical experience, epiphany or trip: ""One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread... `Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the `I' and the `self' that `I' cannot live with."" ""Maybe,"" I thought, ""only one of them is real.""... I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words ""resist nothing,"" as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void... Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marveling at the beauty and aliveness of it all."" After this experience, Ulrich Tolle became a vagrant mystic for a period, rechristened himself Eckhart (presumably after 13th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart) and eventually became a spiritual teacher, author and talk-show guest with extraordinary success. The primary thesis of the book is quite sensible, if unshattering. We exist only in the present; our past and the future are mental constructs. It is a shame that our enjoyment of the present is so often ruined by regrets about the past and worries about the future. By being more intensely focused on the present, we can be more content and more fulfilled. As this doesn't fill 229 pages we are treated to, among other things, lengthy discourses on the ""pain-body"", an interesting theory of menstrual flow as a means to enlightenment and the surprising finding that as a member of the human race, I carry personal complicity and responsibility for all crimes and genocides of the twentieth century including those carried out before my birth. The style is generally chatty, though Eckhart occasionally uses a faux-dialectic to bring up obvious objections to his line of thought, to which he responds with withering scorn. One helpful feature is the use of a pause symbol (§) to indicate points at which ""you may want to stop reading for a moment, become still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said"". The text is interspersed with brief analyses of quotations from various religious traditions, apparently garnered from many weeks studying fridge-magnets. §I am glad to have read the book, if only to have gained a greater understanding of contemporary popular New Age/spiritual literature. If this book changed your life, please do not attack me but have compassion for my ligatures to mind and pain-body which impede my understanding of it.___This is (unfortunately) one of my most-liked reviews. I'd just like to add that I don't automatically hate all writing on these themes. I would warmly recommend Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (Shunryu Suzuki), The Miracle of Mindfulness (Thich Nhat Hanh) and The Courage to Be (Tillich) among others.","There is no nice way to say this. I hated this book with a fiery passion. It did not make me feel at peace. Rather, it made me want to chew off my arm. I bet if we asked Eckhart Tolle why I felt that way, he'd say that I wasn't really listening to his message.My problems with the book were as follows. First off, the tone of the book was extremely condescending. Written in a question/answer format, many of the answers started out with ""You're not really listening"" or ""You don't understand what I'm saying."" Way to kick someone when they're down, dude. Secondly, I felt that he frequently took philosophy and other spiritual messages and twisted them to fit his needs. Basically, he wants people to stop thinking so much. I get the idea that as a culture we over-analyze and whatnot, but his message was basically to stop thinking all together. Sorry Eckhart, but not all of us can wander around for years at a time, sleeping on park benches in a state of euphoria.Also, have you seen his picture on the back of the book? He looks like just the sort of guy who is plotting to take over the world. He wants us to stop thinking for ourselves so that he can think for us!Sorry, back to reality. Basically, I didn't feel like this book offered any real direction or advice to those who seek it.","Mr. Tolle spent two years sitting on park benches and simply ""living in the moment"" prior to writing this book. I doubt whether I will ever take the time in my life to do such a thing, however the suggestion he offers that we all spend a ridiculous amount of time either worrying about the future, or dwelling on the past has impacted me in a huge way. Until I read this book, I never noticed how in sane my mind can make me if I choose to let it. Tolle implores the reader to take the reigns of his own mind, focus on the beauty and love around him, just like we all did when we were children and the world was full of wonder. We are still in that same world, but our vision has been clouded by meetings, appointments, paperwork, debt, clocks ticking, deadlines approaching, past frustrations and dissapointments, the list goes on and on and on if you let it. Tolle suggest that we have the power to focus on this very moment, as it is the only one we really have. The past is past and the future is not here, and may not ever come. A very enlightening book. I highly recomdend it to anyone who would like to improve the quality of this moment of their life."
You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life,Jen Sincero,3.95,"Not good. I can sum up this book pretty quickly. If you want to make a change in your life, or if you are not happy with your life, you are the only one who can make it better. There were a few things that really bothered me. If you are depressed, you cannot simply decide that you are not going to be depressed anymore and get yourself out and have fun. It is apparent that the author has never experienced depression, or been a very sympathetic friend to anyone she knows who has been depressed. I also feel that some of her advice is not very practical in the real world. So if I'm a single mom supporting 4-5 kids, and I've always dreamed of starting my own business, I should just quit my job? I should buy expensive things, that I might not be able to pay for? There is some good advice on stopping negative thoughts, but some of the examples of going for what you really want are just not practical for most people.","""It's not enough to desire something, you've got to want it""Seriously?","*** PSA: Vent Alert***I didn't give this review a low rating because Sicero is a bad writer - she is perfectly effective for the task at hand and actually her appealing ""ra-ra-go-get'em"" voice is what drew me in to begin with. I ultimately bailed however, as I have a Big Problem with the central thesis of this book. Basically it all boils down to the theory that everyone has the power to ""manifest"" their own reality and if things are not working out for them it is because they are not manifesting hard enough and / or not ""vibrating"" at a high enough level. I completely understand the seductive draw of this philosophy i.e. we all control our own destiny. Wouldn't that be simple and lovely? The hard, cold truth - much less palatable to swallow- is that we do not. I do believe that we can choose our attitude most of the time, and that we can choose to give even difficult things in life meaning, but choose what actually happens to us? I'm calling bullshit. I don't buy it. You see, the dark underbelly of Sincero's philosophy is that - if taken to its logical conclusion - it blames the victims of misfortune. So...are children with terminal cancer just not manifesting hard enough? Was the generation of Jews brutally murdered in the Holocaust simply not vibrating at the right frequency? How do the manifesters / vibrators (there are many writers that espouse this theory - especially, I have noticed, those published by Hay House) explain that? Sometimes people are served up an unresolvable shit sandwich by life, and making them feel they should be vibrating and manifesting their way out of it kind of lacks humanity, you know?It's not like I am some sad sack sitting here at home spending my days feeling sorry for myself and the human race. I have done many things I consider rather badass things in my life - took off to France for a year when I was 17 and spoke zero French, applied and got accepted into Oxford University, bought and renovated four vacation rentals in Burgundy, wrote and self-published four bestselling books, and now I am dealing with a life-threatening medical condition (see above re: shit sandwich) in the most pro-active manner I know how...Nevertheless, my brand of bad-assery does not negate the reality that we don't control everything (much as this fact continues to annoy me). People should not be blamed for the curve balls that life lobs at their heads from time to time. They deserve our empathy and compassion, not to be made to feel as though their situation is their fault. Now go and try to manifest and vibrate your way out of that one! ;) ***Vent Over***"
The Gifts of Imperfection,Brené Brown,4.25,"I've read more than my fair share of ""self-help"" literature, so I can assert with conviction that this is not a self-help book. Instead, it's a revelation book. Each chapter triggered numerous ""ah-Ha!"" moments for me, because Dr. Brown goes a step (or two, or five) beyond the common way of looking at or framing an issue to reveal the interconnectedness of elements that stall or sabotage our efforts to live a more satisfying life. Instead of the ""that doesn't quite resonate"" vibe I often get from self-help books, Dr. Brown's perspectives ring true, and she re-labels certain attitudes and experiences in a way that's both startling and, importantly, hopeful. She gleans her insights from her research centered on living a ""wholehearted"" life, which grew out of her previous (perhaps ongoing?) study of ""shame."" The results that Dr. Brown presents in this slim, readable book are nothing short of fascinating, and they function not as a how-to manual for quickly fixing an out-of-balance life, but as a set of powerful tools with which to cultivate a richer, more fully engaged and connected life.","I had to mark this as read to get if off my list. Actually I had to abort the read. Just could not relate to a word of it at all. I feel like this author is speaking a different language. I have a hard time believing anybody really CARES that much about what others think about them. It's amazing to me. A Whole book telling you it's OK if you're not who someone wants you to be?? I feel like saying ""Get a life!""I also Really had trouble with the writing. This author reminds us on almost every single page about her vast research or of how ""professional"" she is. I got about half way through and still did not find a single citation or any sort of documentation of Any research. When someone says, ""I researched that"" and then does not show evidence of Any research, it's about as valid as saying ""I found that online"" and so it must be true. The author was way too busy telling us of all her accomplishments without ever telling us what Exactly She Did. Couldn't read another page. Had to abort. Sorry. Anyone out there want my copy? Please take it.A favorite Goodreads quote: “You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.” ― Eleanor Roosevelt","I read this book after watching Brown's TED talk on vulnerability. The TED talk was shown as the last exercise for a leadership class at work. The talk was intriguing and I wanted to know more. Also, I noted that many of the comments regarding this fairly brief talk were often negative. I found the talk inspiring so I wanted to see if there was any validity to the negative comments.The question that I had in my mind was why was this shown at work? Does Brown suggest that people should be vulnerable with everyone or in a work place environment? In order to be a leader, does she believe that it is necessary to be vulnerable? Upon reading this book, I believe that Brown is asserting that it is necessary to be vulnerable, but only to those who are truly part of your support network. On page 47 of the book, she writes ""Our stories are not meant for everyone. Hearing them is a privilege, and we should always ask ourselves this before we share: ""Who has earned the right to hear my story?"" If we have one or two people in our lives who can sit with us and hold space for our shame stories, and love us for our strengths and struggles, we are incredibly lucky. If we have a friend, or a small group of friends, or family who embraces our imperfections, vulnerabilities, and power, and fills us with a sense of belonging, we are incredibly lucky."" She also says people with high levels of shame resilience ""reach out and share their stories with people they trust."" She also provides a little bit of information about her breakdown/spirtual awakening and says ""During the breakdown, I needed help. I needed support and handholding and advice. Thank God! Turning to my younger brother and sisters completely shifted our family dynamics. I gained permission to fall apart and be imperfect, and they could share their strength and incredible wisdom with me."" So while Brown discusses the need to be able to receive help, she specifically says that is okay to be selective, and tells us that she selected her family to be her support network when she was facing a crisis.I was also curious how Brown defines authencity. Brown, a struggling perfectionist, defines authenticity as ""the daily practice of letting go of who we think we're supposed to be and embracing who we are."" Embracing who we are means accepting that we are not perfect, loving ourselves for who we are, and seeking meaningful connection. She talks about wholehearted living and says that people when overwhelmed, should DIG (Deliberate in their thoughts and behaviors through prayer, meditation, and stating their intentions; be Inspired to make new and different choices, and get Going. They should take action). She also talks about the idea of judging whether or not another person is authentic and comes to the conclusion that this is not a trait that people have or don't have - it is a practice of how we want to live. She doesn't bridge the gap between others judgments of our authenticity and being truly authentic and discuss how there can be a “disconnect”.Brown covers a lot of different topics rapidly. In her TED talk, she talks about being a researcher and a detail-oriented kind of person, so I thought that I would find more factual information. This book doesn't really have that but provides a good list of references in the back. Instead, this is a good refresher to ideas that many of us already know (and practice with a varying degree of success and persistence) - e.g., be mindful, seek connection, look for meaning, be grateful, experience joy. But, sometimes we all need an inspiring reminder to live our lives fully, and this book satisfies that need."
Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,4.17,"Overview: the thesis is that deep work is both rare and valuable in todays world. That's about 1/3 of the book. The rest of the book is practical advice on how to pursue deep work.Part of me feels like a lot of what was said in the book is common sense. Particularly things that people know but can't find the willpower to do. I think that there is some truth to this. But there's also a difference between ""knowing"", and *knowing*. I think this book can help take a lot of people from ""knowing"" to *knowing*. Additionally, there were also a good chunk of things that I didn't know before reading this book.I gave this book a 5 star rating primarily because of how important I think the topic is. By following the advice, I think it could be genuinely life changing.Things I personally am planning to change after reading the book:- A rekindled commitment to eliminating distraction/shallow work from my life. I'm willing to be ruthless in this pursuit. Ex. no more reading marginally useful articles.- A rekindled commitment to seek out hard things. As Paul Graham puts it, ""run uphill"".- Research says that 4 hours is sort of the limit for how much legitimate deep work a human can do in one day. There are also tons of examples of successful people who only put in ~4 hours of deep work per day. So I don't feel (as) guilty anymore about the amount of actual work I get done each day.- Setting a cutoff point each day. ""I don't do any work after 7:00pm"". Your brain needs to recharge, and before it can recharge, it needs the confidence to know that there won't be any more incoming work requests until morning. I've noticed that being ""constantly on"" really stresses me out and makes me less productive, so it needs to stop.- To end the day, a shutdown ritual is useful. Particularly to make sure there's nothing urgent left to do, and to organize your tasks. This way, your mind won't be worried that it shut down too early and needs to get back to work.- Previously I was skeptical about the limits of willpower and thought I could just ""wing it"". Overall I'm still skeptical, but I'm less skeptical and I plan on taking advantage of things that reduce the need for willpower.- In particular, I plan on sticking to a schedule. If I'm explicitly scheduled to be working from 10am-noon, I'll be less inclined to come up with excuses to procrastinate.- The idea isn't to constrain yourself though; the schedule can be flexible. The idea is that by putting deliberate thought into what you do, you'll be less inclined to procrastinate.- It's important to plan ahead so that things like hunger don't interfere with your work.- Perhaps the most important thing I learned from this book is how dangerous it is to constantly cave in to procrastination cravings. Ex. needing to check your phone for the 30 seconds you spend waiting in line. Doing this basically atrophies your willpower muscles and makes it harder to engage in deep work. Next time you're working on something but are tempted to check Facebook, you won't be able to resist. You're too used to caving in. And even if you do resist, the temptation itself will be distracting. I've actually noticed that these sorts of things happen to me and I hate it. So I'm serious about following the advice to cold turkey eliminate procrastination during designated deep work periods, and to not be constantly occupied. Ex. I don't need to watch YouTube videos while I brush my teeth and get dressed in the morning.- I'm quitting Facebook. To me, the upside is clearly not worth the downside of having that temptation.- Productive meditation: take a period where you’re occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving, showering - and focus your attention on a problem.Aside from the core content of the book, I really enjoyed all of the stories and anecdotes. There are a lot of interesting tidbits about the lives of famous and successful people.Overall, I thought the book was extremely well written. It was very clear and understandable. It was broken down into understandable sections and subsections. And I thought Cal (the author) did a *fantastic* job of using stories to illustrate his points. I've noticed that a lot of writers struggle with this and spend too much time in the abstract. Cal made everything very concrete (in addition to making the abstract point clear).I should note that almost none of the arguments in this book are air tight. You could poke holes at them. But if he were to make them air tight, the book would be thousands and thousands of pages long.","If you do one thing to improve your life this year, subscribe to Dr. Newport's blog and start reading his books. I would suggest starting with ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" and then read ""Deep Work."" They compliment each other. The first helps you sort out what you should be focusing on, and the second one tells you how to make sure what's important gets done. Over the years I've read lots of productivity books, and the related literature. But his approach to work impacts me everyday, and nothing has done more to change how I work and how I define success.","Worth reading. Helped me make some drastic changes in my schedule. I will post an update how these changes went after six months.What I learned: (spoiler alerts)1. Figure out what is most valuable to your success.2. Spend most of the time on it, mostly in the early hours of your day where your attention span is long.3. Try to spend at least 3 deep sessions on it approx. 90 min each.4. Almost anything other than your main task is a shallow task.5. Bunch all the shallow tasks into one deep task.6. Nature helps to retain your attention span.7. Email and Internet in general is a huge attention sucker.What I disliked: 1. It is hard to remember what the rules are after reading the whole book. ""So good they cannot ignore you"" did a better job at this.2. I did not like the way the content is organized. Three/four huge chapters.3. Some places it felt like fillers."
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,Susan Cain,4.08,"In a twist that will surprise precisely no one, this book spends a fair amount of time cheering for introverts. What were the odds, right? I assume if you're picking this book up you're on board with that to a certain extent, and likely something of an introvert yourself. This book is certainly for you-or for the perplexed extrovert or ""pseudo-extrovert"" that might be confused by your supposedly mysterious ways. It's a sort of shield, a blockade, a set of reinforced walls that Cain feels it is necessary to throw up around introverts (particularly American introverts) to protect them from the ""Extrovered Ideal,"" of American socialization. The tone of the beginning of the book is thus rather defiant, like Cain is screaming back at everyone she has ever felt pressured by to go to a happy hour or to a dinner party when she had much rather just read a book instead. There's some of this kick-back throughout the book, with plenty of cathartic/sympathetic/rather relatable war stories from introverts just tryin' to make it in an extrovert's world. It is particularly meant to speak to introverts in the high flying business, legal, and/or educational world, where a premium is put on socializing, teamwork, constant connection and multitasking (I am speaking here particularly of the rarefied worlds of Big Law, Wall Street Finance, and Ivy League academia). It's a very career and work focused book, with a surprisingly frequent focus on the bottom line about what traits introverts are more likely to have and how these should be recognized at the top tables in all fields. Her argument, based on one scientific study after another throughout the chapters (deployed like so much artillery), is that introverts tend to think more deeply about problems and persist for longer in trying to solve them. Introverts are supposedly more likely to care about the feelings of others, to make excellent compromising leaders, and to be excellent negotiators (Cain's particular area of expertise) based on their ability to seem soft and actually be tough at the same time. She scorns the merely ""shy"" as extroverts in disguise who share extroverts' traits and want the spotlight but who are just too scared to get it (she would never say this outright, but it is clear that she believes they don't deserve the secret introvert password and is determined to keep out the riffraff). She argues that the extroverts in powerful positions she has seen are more likely to take unjustified risks, to get hopped up on testosterone and the thrill of the chase, to listen to the loudest person in the room, and to walk all over introverts.She readily admits the nuances in these sweeping generalizations. She also admits the worth of extroverts and how introverts greatly enjoy and need their company, both professionally and personally. In addition, she also talks about some legitimate times when introverts may devote time and energy to being extroverted (if they care about something enough- ""Free Trait Theory""). Finally, and in the part that I most appreciated, Cain talks a bit about the ""Situational"" theory of personality- that is, that people's personalities can be completely different in different situations, times and around different people. Therefore, there are very few ""pure"" introverts or ""pure"" extroverts. She also admits that the way that these generalized ""traits"" play out may look very different and may, after all, not be very predictive in any direct way. (Many extroverts may have excellent impulse control, or introverts who care deeply about a cause may act frequently and completely out of character in order to fight for what they believe in.)However, the space devoted to these arguments is much, much smaller than the space devoted to proving, endlessly, how awesome introverts are and why the professional world should value them and stop trying to tell them that they have to be like extroverts because I'm okay and you're okay and it takes all kinds and a village to make the world go round.And honestly? This is a message that's happening to hit me at the right time, when I'm involved in a workplace with a whole lot of extroverts surrounding me. I did find it useful in my particular mindset where I am actively waging a struggle to define my own style in a new profession, since introversion is a part of my identity. I also thought that some of the studies she cited DO make a lot of sense and should be more widely looked at (like the ones that talk about why it's a good idea to ask people to provide feedback and brainstorm online rather than in big meetings or why introverts with closed door offices are more productive or some of the advice to parents about how to cherish their introverted child). I also think that it's nice to have someone sounding the alert that someone speaking quietly is not wrong by default- turn on cable news for thirty seconds and you'll be reminded why that is important.And yet, despite the evident time put into this book, and despite my bias towards it, I couldn't shake the feeling of cynical questioning of what felt like a great deal of pop psychology and arguments made based on feelings, anecdotes and newspaper clippings collected into a narrative. It felt like a file you might keep to make yourself feel better and to express an important part of your identity, rather than a research paper and I'm sure it was aiming at something closer to that crossed with an advice column. There's such a lot of speculation in here, and lots of scientific studies without citations or countervailing evidence brought into play. (For example, it certainly didn't help that the minute after I read one of the more fluffy scientific studies in here about how we Americans as a culture are more drawn to people that display significantly more traditionally dominant body language in pictures I saw it in an issue of Marie Claire in a box near the back of the magazine reconfigured to be about women being attracted to men and how you've gotta look aggressive and Manly to get us ladiezz don't you know?) It just seems like a book written for a specific audience that you can rely on to make that leap to ""just know"" what you mean because they've got an emotional bank of misunderstood years and moments to draw on. In short, it appeals to an ""emotional truth"" built on hundreds of pages of stories and studies that may or may not add up to anything at all. On the one hand, it's maybe okay to create a space for a ""community"" of sorts to feel and process some of that- on the other hand, it will drag down the overall quality of that work into something closer to a melancholy history crossed with a dinner party argument. Therefore, despite its strengths, and despite the personal enjoyment and help that I have taken from the book at this particular time, I can't rate it as more than an above average read. An intellectualized comfort read for introverted professionals, really, if such a specialized category really exists. I can't rate it higher when I feel like one good scholarly journal review would take the whole theory down, especially when it feels like an argument for corporations to pay introverts more a lot of the time. Nonetheless, a lot of interesting questions asked, a lot of self-reflection inspired. Recommended for my fellow introverts if you're at a place where you feel like something like I described above might be helpful to you at this time. Otherwise, I'd say you could skip it or just watch her TED talk instead.","“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I read this book for the same reason most people read this book: I am an introvert. I have always been an introvert, and it's a fundamental, sometimes limiting, part of who I am. I've learned to deal with it better over the years - learned to clasp my shaking hands together during presentations, force myself to breathe normally and keep my voice steady, even force myself to make the first move in social situations. Unless you are also an introvert, you probably won't understand the efforts I have to go to (and the psychological strain this puts on me) just to behave in a way that is considered socially acceptable and is desired by employers.It's actually caused me upset and distress for many reasons. Firstly because I find it hard to cope in the many situations where bright, outgoing personalities thrive. Secondly because it's just considered a negative trait. Look at magazines, look at books like How to Win Friends and Influence People, look at job applications asking for ""people persons"". I remember reading teen magazines in high school and seeing stupid articles about how to attract boys - confident, dazzling personalities are a necessity! - and feeling a very real blow to my self-esteem.But I have accepted it as an unfortunate fact of reality for years - the simple conclusion that being introverted is a bad thing. Not a terrible thing, and definitely not an impossible thing to cope with - technology billionaires are often introverts after all - but something limiting (like a lower intelligence) that I must constantly battle against to make it through this world.Until I read this book.Susan Cain uses facts, statistics and her own case studies to show that introverts are greatly successful and powerful, not in spite of their introversion, but because of it. She compares different types of businesses and teamwork to show how extroverts and introverts each excel in different types of business environments. For example, extroverts often lead businesses better when there is little input from other team members; whereas introverts thrive in situations that rely on the input of a team because they are more likely to listen to the other members and implement their ideas.From Harvard Business School students to Ivy League professors to Rosa Parks, Cain looks at the different types of influence introverts and extroverts have. She does not place favour on one or the other, but instead portrays a view of the world in which both have an extremely important part to play - it just so happens that the extroverts tend to be ""louder"" about it. It's an important, engaging book that pulled along even a lover of fiction and fantasy like me. And, though comforting, it is still a respectable study that achieves more than just making introverts feel a little better about themselves. The findings speak for themselves and not only serve to please a shy little weirdo like me, but also make a lot of sense.An important read for introverts and extroverts alike.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr","I always thought I was just weird...I can be alone in my car for a 1h drive and not want to have the radio or music on. On sundays I often join the walking club for a long 25km walk, but I prefer to do it alone (and oh, all the pity looks you get!). The idea of surprise parties makes me sick to my stomach, and any event where a thousand people are together is possibly even worse. I dislike small talk, but I probably hate even more how nervous I get when I have to do it. I can feel sad for a bruised tomato no-one wants to buy (hey, he tried his best too, not his fault someone dropped him!), and while everyone else goes to the modern, light apothecary across the street with the super nice people always happy to help, I go to the dark and older one who never has clients (how else will he survive?)Turns out I'm not that weird. I'm just a full blood introvert. And yet, I'm not what you think. I'm not particularly shy, I'm not the grey bird that never says a word and everyone forgets she's around. I'm very opinionated and quite stubborn, and when amongst friends I know well, I can be the loudest person in the room. But still I'm introvert. After being with friends or colleagues, I need recharging time. I need to be alone. I (almost) always think before I talk. I enjoy getting to the bottom of things, I enjoy detective work. And I can go on and on.While reading this book, on occasion I was nodding so hard I thought my head might fall off.There were very little eye-opening surprises in this book, and even a few things I didn't agree with or I would have hoped for her to explore more. Even a few occasions I thought she was idealizing introverts. This book was not perfect, but somehow i feel that it was important for me to read it.Overall, it was quite liberating. I'm not that weird! About a third of us on this planet (and on a website as Goodreads probably a LOT more) are more or less like me - not completely like me, I'm still unique (I insist!)But that might not be an issue. Though some of you might recognize some of my examples above, I've never met someone before that can feel bad for a bruised tomato. So maybe i'm still little weird, and my own unique self. Hoorah"
"Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead",Brené Brown,4.29,"Teddy Roosevelt is spinning in his grave if he can hear how his famous quote about ""daring greatly"" has been turned into sappy psychobabble. The main theme of the book is ""shame."" To the author, this is a fundamentally bad thing, even though she acknowledges that shameless people are sociopaths. She also makes the claim that shame has never been shown to be helpful. Actually, there is research suggesting that shame-based societies have less crime and mental illness than societies that are more individualistic. So I think there is potential harm to the way she redefines shame. If people are engaging in truly shameful behaviors, then they should feel ashamed; that's healthy. And society should shame evil people/acts. The author uses ""shame"" as a garbage term for all bad feelings. So getting picked last for kickball is somehow ""shame."" This book is advertised as ""research"" but the underlying science seems goofy; part of her methodology is to ignore the existing scientific literature before doing her study, so that she's amazed--as if she were born yesterday--by well-known facts. The definition of the scientific method is testing hypotheses, but she doesn't do that, so what she does do looks like circular reasoning where the finding is always ""shame."" It's OK to do ""qualitative"" research, but if you insist on the pretense of being completely open-minded blah-blah-blah, then you're ""hypothesis generating"" so at some point you still need to test a hypothesis to do science, and to know if you are helping people. Dare greatly: state your hypothesis and test it! Much of the book is a running anecdotal monologue about the author. The author seems like a nice lady who means well, and the original message of courage is a good one. The point of self-help books is to help, so if this book resonates with you, then ""bully for you"" as Teddy might say. I just found it irritating: another TED talk that can't carry a whole book. I hope I don't hurt the author's feelings with this review. The point of reviews is to help potential readers figure out if they will like a book or not. People who care about the points that I discuss above will likely share my impression of the book and can save time by avoiding it and just watching the TED talk. I didn't like this book very much and that's my right. And it's part of the risk the author takes in writing a book that she will get some bad reviews. You can't please everybody. I admire her for daring to write a book. But that doesn't mean she should only get good reviews. If the only outcome possible is victory, then victory is meaningless.-December, 2017 Update: I keep getting negative comments about this review, and that's fine as long as people can disagree agreeably. I understand many people love Brene Brown. Nevertheless, I have become more concerned about this book and I am lowering my rating to 1* from 2*. Part of the tipping point is the increasing evidence indicating that sheltering children from shame/guilt/failure does more harm than good over the long term: -Link to plain English article by a pediatrician from this week's Science Times about benefits of shame/guilt for kids: https://nyti.ms/2ia0gji-Link to recent NYT Magazine article about surge in teen anxiety: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/ma...Of course, a total lack of shame is sociopathy, and I don't think the world needs more of that.  

 The Sociopath Next DoorI am also concerned that with a blurb stating ""Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision"" people think that this is science, and that it represents some kind of proven new discovery that helps people.

 Finally, I think that reading a biography of Teddy Roosevelt would clarify how he would feel about celebrating failure, etc. Theodore Rex","This book came highly recommended by seemingly the entire internet, and the concept was one I'm VERY familiar with. I'd watched a couple of Brene Brown's TED talks and I was impressed with the topic of her research and with how long and how thoroughly she's been researching. Oh yeah, and I also remembered that I am the most sewn up and invulnerable control freak that I know. It's been something I'm aware of, and I wasn't always this way. But I know it's keeping me from joy and love in a lot of areas in my life, so I'm working on it.This book doesn't fix everything, but boy is it good at calling you out and naming things. The very act of naming bad emotional habits, harmful tactics with people, etc...it takes away their power somewhat. At least that's how I felt. Ms. Brown's book takes a hard look at what vulnerability is, why we're so afraid of it, what keeps us from allowing it (shame) and how it affects men and women differently. She backs up her conclusions with research data, numbers, anecdotes and helpful insights into her own life. I really enjoyed her humor and candor. She takes a look at vulnerability as a professional, as a partner, a friend, and as a parent. All are really valuable view points.The bottom line is, we're hard-wired to be connected to others. We can't experience joy or peace without these connections. However, we can't have these connections without allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. I really can't recommend this book enough to anyone, any gender, and in any life situation. It's valuable and the topics she brings up need to be addressed.","""For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is ""I didn't get enough sleep."" The next one is ""I don't have enough time."" Whether true or not, that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don't have enough of... Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we're already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn't get, or didn't get done, that day. We go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack... This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life..."""
"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",Bessel van der Kolk,4.37,"The Body Keeps Score is my jam. It's better than that. It's like my slammajam. This is my fave book of the year so far, by a bunch. It's a rich treasure trove of information from the frontiers of trauma research, etiology, diagnosis and treatment. It's changing the way I do therapy and it's changing the way a interpret human behavior. And to think. I almost didn't read it.When I entered the mental health field I had intended to specialize in Somatic Experiencing (SE) trauma therapy. But I quickly rejected the model when I realized it was way outside the mainstream and lacked randomized control trials (RCT) that demonstrated its effectiveness compared to other ""first line"" treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE). I saw the author Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk lecture at the Evolution of Psychotherapy conference in 2013. He was awesome, and he really reinvigorated my interest in doing somatically oriented trauma work. But something about the experience as a whole left me feeling woozy.Perhaps my experience was negativity impacted by the mass, prolonged exposure to the unwashed throngs of other psychotherapists (never a good thing), some of whom were from the San Francisco Bay Area (a deadly combination).Don't get me wrong. There are lots of mental health professionals (even ones from the Bay Area) that are highly functional, sober, top notch folks. But there are also a bunch of kooky, crazy as fuck people in the field (Particularly in the Bay Area), and there were a bunch in the crowd, and I think I was feeling a bit (or perhaps a lot) of shame for my profession. A pathological shame that was clearly a sequallia of my own dark hippy shadow.I myself lived in the Bay Area for around a decade. I came to therapy from an unconventional ""hippyish"" background. I went to art school as an undergraduate. I have practiced yoga and meditation for over 30 years. Plus I have a couple of crappy tattoos. When I entered the field I was dreadfully afraid no one would take me seriously. So I somewhat consciously but mostly unconsciously tried to distance myself from my own freaky roots. I was probably still up in my head about all that when I was listening to Dr. Van Der Kolk. I was loving what he was saying, the parts I could understand any way (he speaks in a thick Dutch accent), but I also remember looking around the room and thinking ""I have to distinguish myself from these nutty hippies"". Perhaps it was at that point I unconsciously gripped up and rejected somatic trauma work (again) in favor of the more ""masculine"" ""serious"" ""evidence based"", behaviorally oriented, here and now stuff that I currently practice. Which, by the way, is Acceptance Comment Therapy (ACT). A mindfulness based variant of CBT which is incidentally a ""hippy as fuck"" therapeutic modality by many standards.Anyway.When I first saw that the book was released, I was like ""hey, that looks pretty good"" but then I had a flash back from the psychotherapy conference. It was an intrusive mental image of a patchouli smelling, chubby middle aged hippy chick in a mauve knit poncho sweater and dream catcher earrings saying ""your fifth level is emitting too much teal energy"" and I reflexively withdrew my enthusiasm for the whole somatically oriented trauma treatment program.Anyway. I did eventually get over myself (and my hippy phobia) and got the book and man is it good. It's extremely, extremely triple extremely good. It's like, organically, cosmically, spin your chakras at a dead show good.And despite Dr. Van Der Kolk's activist agenda, he's actually a pretty reputable (Harvard affiliated) scientist and clinician and widely regarded as one the the worlds foremost authorities on trauma and trauma sequelae (yes I used the term seguelae twice in the same review, actually three times if you count the time I just used sequallia in this parentheses, oops, better make that four). And, yes, Dr. Van Der Kolk also apparently does yoga and meditation and has probably smoked tons of weed and hung out at Eslen. But I am willing to forgive the man for that because I too have been guilty of similar behavior in my woolly headed, not so distant past. Before I became a therapist, I was on my own journey to recovery from addiction, trauma, depression, anxiety etc.BTW: when I hear other therapist start talking about their recovery, I cringe. Please forgive me if you're feeling cringy. But sometimes we all have to go there in order to communicate certain important points.Anyway.The foundation of my recovery was self-care. For me, self-care was (and still is) founded on basics such as: healthy sleep, exercise and nutrition. It also included good therapy and a little 12-step. But the rocket fuel of my recovery was yoga, loving kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation.Now, one of my primary intentions as a therapist is to assist my clients in developing self compassion and embodied mindfulness skills for utilization in their recovery.While the secular mindfulness revolution thing that has been happening over the past two decades has normalized mindfulness and provided ample scientific evidence for the clinical use value of mindfulness training e.g. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).And mindfulness-based psychotherapeutic modalities such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) have provided evidence-based mindfulness integrated psychotherapeutic frameworks.The evidence for somatically oriented (embodied) therapeutic modalities has lagged. Dr. Van Der Kolk's work is providing this evidence and is blazing the trail for mainstream acceptance of somatically oriented practices. Dr. Van Der Kolk's work is also foundational for changing the way the field conceptualizes and diagnoses trauma. Additionally Dr. Van Der Kolk is lending legitimacy to some cutting-edge and very exciting trauma treatments such as Neural Feedback and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). I, like millions of other people, have suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. In early recovery I received lots of good therapy for trauma and I'm happy to report that I am no longer impaired by PTSD symptoms.Out of all of the therapy I received, anecdotally speaking, I have to say, some of the most effective was EMDR. I had phenomenal results from an equally phenomenally brief treatment time (two, one hour sessions). This is standard EMDR testimonial. People very commonly report that it works and it works fast.Again, as a nascent therapist in training, I had intended to train in EMDR. But EMDR is like the dirty redheaded stepchild of psychotherapy. Despite ample evidence of its efficacy, nobody can figure out why it works, so the model has been widely rejected by the mainstream mental health community. I sort of drank the Kool-Aid and jumped on the anti EMDR bandwagon. But after reading this book, I'm feeling very enthusiastic about treating trauma with EMDR.I could go on and on, but I'd rather just urge you to do yourself a big favor and read this book.","This book represents everything that is groundbreakingly wonderful and and pseudoscientifically horrendous about trauma research. Individuals who suffer trauma are in need of actual help. This book contains some of the best, latest, and most effective cures for trauma sufferers, which can steer patients toward the help they need. However, van der Kolk seems wholly unable to engage in critical thinking when it comes to various treatments. When attending courses in cognitive neuroscience and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, my favorite professors were those who ripped apart each treatment to examine it for efficacy. The profs held out hope that cures were attainable but put them under the microscope to make damn sure the ""cure"" would not actually retraumatize and individual or make matters worse. In order to trust a mental health care provider, that provider should demonstrate not only a knowledge of the literature (as van der Kolk does as he repeatedly throws around his MD and Harvard alma marter to assure his reader of his credentials) but also an ability to sort out fact from fiction. van der Kolk seems entirely enamored with outdated findings (that have since been shown to be incorrect) and therapies that have failed to be backed up by empirical support. Most concerning, he seems completely in denial about how easily false memories form and the damage they can do. On a more positive note, he does a great job championing individuals who are often rejected by the field of psychiatry. Since false memories are real, and they have wreaked havoc on an already traumatized person's fragile life, many aspects that lead to remembering repressed memories have come under fire. This has served to invalidate the real and true experiences suffered by many people during their childhoods and beyond. Under particular scrutiny is dissociation, something that can be particularly difficult for survivors to deal with, is treated as if it doesn't exist. This is certainly a problem and I do not know how to find a middle ground between dissociation deniers and false memory/ personality creating therapists, but I would venture to say that van der Kolk's approach is not it. There has got to be a better way to validate the real, and sometimes repressed traumas while, at the same time, not creating new ones by promoting fictitious experiences that do not exist. Additionally, there is a lot of study involving a person's perception that never made it into this book. I understand that, again, it is difficult to take on the effects of perception while simultaneously trying to validate what really happened to people. But, perception can really affect mental health and subsequent behavior. Not only that, there is a very real phenomenon in which excused behavior can cause the trauma sufferer to continue to delve out trauma to others. While van der Kolk mildly touched on this at times, he did not do so in any in depth of concrete manner. This book could have been half as long and, if van der Kolk had stuck to only empirically sound findings and treatments, could have been a great book. Associating words with Harvard and MD doesn't make them true. It just makes people believe them more. Sometimes that is more harmful than helpful. Despite the foregoing criticisms, this book, with its many chapters on various treatments, might help trauma sufferers seek a treatment that seems right for them.","Am I supposed to feel bad for Tom? I don't. He reports that he murdered a farmer, children, and raped a woman in a village in Vietnam to ""cope"" with the loss of his platoon. I don't understand why he was never criminally charged for this? Being traumatized doesn't give you free reign to do whatever you want. The author even seems to blow it off by saying something like, ""I understand why this happened. Men have been getting revenge like this since Homer's time"". Now, Tom is actually parading around as a lawyer in the United States. I guess if you kill and rape in another country it gets forgiven? Are their lives worth less than American lives? The author even brings up a certain case Tom got very excited about being involved in; finally ""felt alive"". He was defending a murderer, and he won. I'm not sure how the author missed the fact that in Tom's brain he was actually defending himself in a desperate attempt to justify his actions in Vietnam. I'm also not sure how the author seems to miss the fact that he seems to be empathizing with a very problematic, asshole, rapist, homicidal combat veteran in an attempt to become closer to his own father's memory. Hardly a mention of Tom's wife, who is seemingly unawares that she is married to a man who committed these atrocities. There is not a serious consideration for the safety of her or their children, despite the fact that Tom is ""prone to violent outbursts"". I'm quite upset over this portion of the book and the lack of empathy shown by the author towards Tom's victims. He even mentions Tom and his friend chasing around ""Vietnamese bar girls"" in a weird ""boys will be boys"" way, blatantly ignoring the trauma that led those women to that situation to begin with. Oh, and again the fact that Tom had a significant other at home during that ""good fun"". This isn't worth my time to finish. It borders on misogyny and is very tone deaf. I'm actually pretty disgusted by it. People like Tom are the main cause of all of this bullshit in the first place. Shelving."
Poets Square: A Memoir in Thirty Cats,Courtney Gustafson,4.74,this is my most anticipated book for the entirety of 2025 and I'm not even kidding,"This book is a thing of sheer beauty. From the deep emotional resonance, the nuanced and insightful cultural criticism, and the stunning writing that pulls it all together, it’s a wonderful experience. I loved sitting with this book, these stories, the cats, and the passion for care.So excited for this book to come out and see people screaming and crying over it.","A really fantastic memoir that's about cats but also not really about cats. Full disclosure, I've followed the author on Instagram and Tiktok for a long time and have been a big fan of her content. She's a natural storyteller, and she's quite moving on social media and in written, novel form. The author, Courtney, has a powerful voice (her Instagram captions alone have made me happy cry and sad cry more than once) and she is able to convey emotion and empathy in her storytelling in a really forthright manner. Her prose isn't dense, verbose, or overly flowery; she says exactly what needs to be said. The format of the book was really unique and interesting and made moving from lighthearted to really heavy topics very digestible. I read her book very easily in almost one sitting. I'm really impressed with how vulnerable Courtney was in this book, able to really understand the cats but also very self-aware when her emotions seemingly about the cats were really directed inward. I feel like I intimately know every cat she described, and it was really fun to hear the backstories of cats and events Courtney has mentioned online. She's so introspective and open in this book that I think most everyone will relate to at least one of her characteristics or experiences. Courtney is also just really funny in a silly, kind-spirited way. It's very easy to see why she's been so successful online and in community organizing. I'm usually skeptical about memoirs written by young people (how much can there be to talk about when you're not even halfway through your life?) but Courtney really told the full spectrum of the human experience. I smiled, shook my head, laughed, cried, and made comments to my own cat while reading this book. There are serious topics discussed, including mental health issues, poverty, unhoused community issues, relationship abuse, grief, and, of course, the hardest parts of pets and animals. Courtney approaches her story and the cast of characters and cats with honesty and respect. I'll definitely buy a physical copy when this book is out and bug everyone I know to read it. I will also read all of her next books, which I hope are forthcoming. I was thrilled to get this arc, and it didn't disappoint. Thank you, Crown Publishing!"
"The Fate of the Day: The War for America, Fort Ticonderoga to Charleston, 1777-1780",Rick Atkinson,4.67,"Let me get this out of the way real quick. If you are looking at reviews for Rick Atkinson's The Fate of the Day because you already read The British Are Coming and want to make sure Atkinson didn't magically forget how to write then fear not. Volume Two is just as exceptional as Volume One of his Revolution Trilogy. Please go read in the warm confidence that there is no letdown.For those who haven't read The British Are Coming, well, go read that. Why would you start with The Fate of the Day? That's like watching Back to the Future II before you watch the first one. Oh, you still want a full review? I mean, fine. It's still weird, though.Atkinson's newest looks at the time between the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1777 (by the British, the Americans took Ticonderoga in the last one) to the siege of Charleston (and not the Battle of Sullivan's Island from the first book... and see it makes more sense if you read the first book before this one). Atkinson covers everything he possibly can from a military perspective from the big battles to smaller ones often ignored when talking about the Revolution.There is an easy flow to the author's writing. People are introduced, their background given a little embellishment, and then we get to the military activities. A lot of books fall into the trap of either derailing the narrative to give long biographies of every character or not presenting enough for the reader to become connected to the person. Atkinson deftly avoids this by giving short biographies but also using the person's own words whenever possible. It allows the reader to get a better understanding of character while not going off on tangents. I actually think Atkinson does this even better in this book than the previous. Slightly longer introductions of people like the Marquis Lafayette (a personal fave) and John Paul Jones are exceptional and welcome. Atkinson also spends a bit more time with the political stories around the Revolution. More time is spent in England and France to give a fuller understanding of how the war was affecting those countries at home.At the same time, there is no letup when it comes to the military actions. To be clear, this is not what I would call a ""military history"" in the traditional sense. We don't get pages upon pages of every single maneuver in battle (which is sometimes awesome, for the record). It is a detailed accounting of the chosen battles but only for vital activities. More importantly, Atkinson resurrects the stories of many battles and actions which you won't find in most books. Yes, American Revolution nerds know about the Battle of Ushant for example, but I certainly don't expect most people to have ever heard of it. However, Atkinson both tells a great story and shows how important it is to the our understanding of the war and its outcome.A common misconception is the the sequel is often worse than the original. It is certainly incorrect here.(This book was provided as an advance reader copy by Netgalley and Crown (ha, ironic!) Publishing.)","Rick Atkinson is a trilogy kind of a guy. He used three volumes to detail World War II. This is the middle volume of a trilogy about the Revolutionary War. Atkinson is the kind of writer who I check regularly, sometimes foolishly too early, to see when the next volume is coming out. Nothing in this work disappointed. I'm already checking for 3. And here's the thing: I needed to read about the Second World War; I didn't think I needed this. But I did.It's a military history, yes, but that would be dismissively unfair. Because Monarchs send troops, and troops are the people. And people, who do not want the war, lose their wheat fields and milking cow, and sometimes worse.So that's all there. There was stuff I knew, but maybe I didn't know. Like how the British employed Native warriors and Hessian mercenaries. And that the Franco-American alliance was not a small thing, though the French tended to pull-up in battle.Disease, weather, incompetence, treachery, wives and children: all here.But such a writer.If you love words - and you wouldn't be reading this if you didn't - you would know that Atkinson does too. And so, the Earl of Sandwich was not just a rascal, but a rakehell. ""Vices, more than years, have marked him gray."" You'll find panjandrums. You'll awake at cockcrow. And if you sally to France, as John Paul Jones did, you'd be wise to take the wise Ben Franklin's advice (he would know), and get a sleeping dictionary.*There are wonderful battle vignettes here, told brilliantly, sometimes with horrid details. But things were not going well for the locals, not really for the girth of this book. Yet it ends hopefully, with various voices speaking about My Country. There is something in the air........On now to check for Volume 3.______________*a bilingual mistress.","I received an advanced copy of this book thanks to a Goodreads Giveaway. It’s my opinion that Rick Atkinson’s previous body of work has already placed him in the pantheon of the true greats of American historical writing alongside the likes of Francis Parkman, Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote. This, the second volume of an eventual trilogy covering the American Revolution only further cements his position. Truly exceptional. Can’t wait for volume 3."
Penelope's Bones: A New History of Homer’s World through the Women Written Out of It,Emily Hauser,4.43,"'In this book, it's the women who are going to take us on a journey through the Iliad and the Odyssey and across the splendid tumultuous world of the late Bronze Age'.If you love Greek Classics, mythology, or ancient history, but more importantly, women's history, then you're sure to devour this book. Using some of the key women portrayed in the two, iconic classic tales, the Iliad and the Odyssey, as a starting point, Emily Hauser re-focuses our lens to examine the real women behind characters. She hasn't just used her academic knowledge or desktop research to piece together hypotheses but has augmented written words with the latest in DNA testing and modern archaeological scholarship to present a well-rounded notion of just who these women might have been. It's the mothers, the warriors, the slaves, and the queens. It's all women from the late Bronze Age that are touched upon. Through her book, she brings a more balanced view to the very masculine world, of that age, that has always previously been presented.You'll need to take your time with this book as it is packed with information and substantiation; each chapter feels like its own story. Once you've completed it though, you will come out with a very different view of the types of women, their roles, their lives, their regard, than you had previously.'There's always more to find. And that's worth waiting for'.","We need to get this out of the way first and foremost: what this book is. And what it is not. It is NOT a retelling of The Iliad, The Odyssey, or any other Greek myth. It is NOT a work of fiction. This book is an unflinchingly honest, real look at some historical, scientific, archaeological, and mythological canon information about some of the the key female characters within Homer, such as Helen, Aphrodite, Penelope, Athena, Circe, and Andromache along with others. This is not a ""girl boss"" examination of their character, making them superheroes or modern culture of 2025 appropriate figures. This book looks at the women in the context of the world and time in which they lived. And it was an ugly, brutal, harsh world indeed for women, and especially non-Greek women during the Trojan Wars. The Aphrodite and Hera chapter in particular was incredible to me, but honorable mentions to the Thetis, Bryseis, and Circe chapters for being especially impactful to me as a lover of Greek myth, religion, and history. I've been thinking about some of the the DNA evidence factoids within the book for days now, and I suspect that they will continue to haunt me for weeks. The text is beautifully written and when it's fully published should have some detailed maps and art. I can't wait to see those diagrams!This is a MUST BUY for anyone who wants more historical context around the Iliad and the Odyssey. Even though this book is focused around the women, it grants a lot of insight into the characters of Achilles, Odysseus, Hektor, Paris, and Telemachus to name a few. I will absolutely be buying this when it releases later this year and telling all my Hellenic polytheist/Greek pagan friends and history lovers to pick this book up! Thank you so very much to Emily Hauser, the publisher, and NetGalley for the advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!","Mythica by Emily Hauser is a well-researched reexamination of Homer’s mythological women from the late Bronze Age who have long stood under the shadows of Greek heroes, viewed through a feminist lens (or perhaps, more accurately, a non-misogynistic perspective). Through the blending of scientific research, literary references, archaeological findings, and anthropology, Hauser's inquisitive work suggests new connections and hypotheses about the “support” women of Greek mythology, returning their voices, lives, and history, and gifting the reader with astounding recent findings—as recent as 2023. In this intriguing book, she evokes Hittite and Greek queens, warriors, mothers, slaves, and goddesses whose stories were warped and fitted into male-centric narratives.The narrative has an excellent balance between accessibility and academic rigor, making the complex subjects of genetics, archaeology, historical context, and literary critique engaging to a broad audience. Mythica is an outstanding book that reads like a documentary. Famous figures like Penthesilea, Circe, Penelope, Cassandra, and many other ancient women who were repeatedly brutalised by Homer’s great male heroes are now interestingly reframed. Hauser does an excellent job in stripping the text from the most technical language without hindering the narrative, and consistently enticing the reader with new insights referring to the history behind mythology. In her notes, she mentions using quotations from Emily Wilson's translation (the first woman to translate the Iliad and the Odyssey from the source material), alongside her own translations (she notes studying ancient Greek for over twenty years). This approach is important to avoid repeating the same analysis carried out previously. Her exploration of archaeology and modern technologies—like ancient DNA evidence and digital facial reconstructions (shout-out to the University of Manchester!)—is clear and accessible. It is fascinating what she managed to achieve in this book.Modern tools like archaeology, literary critique, and DNA analysis can help uncover the truths about these women’s lives, offering us a more comprehensive and realistic view of these late Bronze Age women. The focus on characters like Briseis and Chryseis illustrates the harrowing reality of how these women’s stories have been sidelined, their pain and strength minimized, and used as devices to serve a hero’s purpose. Hauser articulates a reimagining of these women not as mythical figures but as real individuals with experiences that reflect the complexities of ancient Greek and Hittite societies; inviting the reader to reconsider the pre-conception of stories we’ve inherited and rethink them as complex, nuanced, and multifaceted stories.Mythica is a necessary book for anyone interested in Greek mythology, history, and a non-misogynistic analysis of the Homeric women. Hauser’s well-researched, fascinating and thought-provoking work challenges ingrained perceptions and re-signifies the experiences of the women who shaped the myths that have persisted for millennia.Rating: 4.5/5Highly RecommendedThank you, Emily Hauser and Random House UK, Transworld Publishers | Doubleday, for this digital galley via NetGalley in exchange for my honest and personal opinion."
The Last American Road Trip: A Memoir,Sarah Kendzior,4.13,"Kendzior is one if the most earnest and heartfelt writers I've ever read. She writes about Missouri, being an American, her travels and her family and weaves in politics so skillfully I promise you might not realise - or at least won't mind.I almost went through and listed all the destinations and tourist attractions, because I want to see all of them, but there are many and that isn't a review. I did especially enjoy descriptions of the tourist traps on Route 66, the accidental cult site encounter, the ghost story, and of course all the Western deserts, parks and arches.The most inspiring thing throughout the book - and a value I hold dear - is to be open to experiences. And open to people too, though that can be a challenge for this introvert. As with our country, we should be so with people - open to the beauty or quirkiness and honest about the flaws through history.*I received this in an ARC giveaway by Goodreads. I'm not required to write a review, but chose to do so.","In this memoir of a bygone America, Kendzior takes us on a cross country road trip that's steeped in the history of places falling into disrepair or in danger of disappearing altogether, mirrored by the state of our democracy. What begins as a journey of nostalgia for a country that once was, the myth of the American dream seems to crumble as the author reconciles a fraught history with the realization that not much has changed. America still can't grapple with its ideology of ""the land of the free"" and the ""pursuit of happiness"" while rolling back rights and the increasing difficulty to make ends meet in a country drunk on greedy oligarchs, religious zealotry and hyperindividualism. The rundown roadside attractions, national parks, and fabled highways such as Route 66 are a backdrop to Kendzior's elegy for a country in decline. What begins as a desire to show her children the country she loves turns into a meditation on the hostile history and tenuous future of America the ""great."" Well written, thoughtful, and colloquial, The Last American Road Trip is a scenic ride over bumpy back roads.Thank you to Flatiron books for the ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review.","An interesting installment, or, I dunno, a different moment in time in Kendzior's evolution, ... probably a little warmer ... and, hmm, ... maybe somewhat less informative or less of an advocacy piece ... but no less worth reading (or, more accurately, very much worthwhile).I concede I'd be curious to hear what a first-time Kendzior reader would think if they started with this one. For me, it very much felt like the next (and a fitting) chapter in an ongoing serial (or conversation).Unlike some of her other other books, with this one, I found myself waffling between three types of reactions: On the one hand, having grown up in the military, crisscrossed the nation as a kid in a Ford Country Squire station wagon (initially, sans air conditioning), long-hauled other stretches throughout college, I was entirely enamored with the (family) road-tripping, park-hopping, cave-exploring ... experiencing of America. At the same time, as she is wont to do, Kendzior triggers all of my despondency-laden doomer instincts, currently vacillating between the horror of kleptocracy and the end of the American democratic experiment to the related, but even broader, existential failure to seriously confront the climate crisis. And ... on a more heartening note, Kenzior waxed eloquently on the joys and hopes and fears of parenthood and family (and, alas, loss...). All woven into a complicated and, more often than not, cohesive, compelling, and evocative web.One of Kenzior's many strengths is her self-awareness and, yes, her (frank, unvarnished, unsparing) honesty. Which is why I kept going back to two sentences, pretty early on in the book. She writes: I want to be a good mother, a good writer, and a good American. From afar, as a reader, my money says she's gone three for three. But she concludes the same paragraph with the painful lament: I want my predictions to sound less like eulogies. And, yes, I want that too. Unfortunately, we have to play the hand we're dealt. And, because she is who she is, having studied what she studied and learned what she learned, writing non-fiction (rather than fantasy, sci-fi, or speculative fiction) now, I don't see her being afforded that luxury. And that's a shame (for her and for all of us).OK, OK,, it's a bit hard for me to be objective here. I was not only open to the author's message and themes, but ... yes ... I did pre-order the book and, yes, this is the fifth book of hers I've read, and ... over the years, I've found her unusually, remarkably, and, often jarringly prescient and far more ahead of the curve, not only in terms of understanding what's coming but explaining in terms that my mind - far too susceptible to denying the obvious - can process. I just wish more ... OK, lots more ... Americans read her work."
"Slayers, Every One of Us: How One Girl in All the World Showed Us How to Hold On","Kristin Russo (Author & Narrator), Jenny Owen Youngs (Author & Narrator)",4.30,"Thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the audio ARC. It hasn't affected the contents of my review.I have absolutely no idea how Slayers, Every One of Us will play for people who don't listen to Buffering and haven't spent years getting to know Kristin and Jenny via audio, but I had a great time with it. I kept getting teary and having all these sad small cries that were over in like five seconds*. I started keeping track of them and had about six by the end of the book. As of fan of their podcast from literally day one (I have no memory where I heard about it; probably someone on gay Twitter), this was both like stepping back in time as they relived the early days, and seeing behind the curtain. *I mostly cried at the way they talked about Buffy and what stories can mean in everyday life, but there were certain real life moments for Kristin and Jenny that made get choked up, too.An important warning: Absolutely do not read this book unless you don't care about being spoiled for the entire plot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (it's beyond me why you would want to read this book with no interest in Buffy, but hey, you do you). The whole point of the book is that their podcast journey through the TV show eerily mirrored Buffy's journey, so they talk about it all.I think if you like audio, the audiobook is the way to go, because a good part of this book is spent on talking about the songs Kristin and Jenny wrote for the podcast, in various contexts, and clips from the songs (and sometimes the entire song) are included in the audiobook. A lot more fun than reading lyrics in a book. Kristin and Jenny read the audio themselves, in an almost duet fashion, and I actually listened to an audiobook on 1.0x speed for the first time in forever because I'm used to hearing them speak at a certain speed and it was really throwing me off to have them at 1.25x or 1.5x. Presumably this won't be a problem other people have. Even listening on a slower speed, I managed to listen to this whole thing in one day.I do have a hard copy of this book coming, which I'm glad for, because I think they included exclusive content in each format, and I want to look at the pictueres.","There is no piece of media that I love more than Buffy, so when I saw this book available on NetGalley, I grabbed it without scrutinizing the synopsis too much. I didn't quite realize that it was really more about a podcast about Buffy, and about the personal lives of the hosts of the podcast. I still would have read it if I'd realized - I like memoirs, and I know of Jenny Owen Youngs' music, and did I mention Buffy? - but since I'm not a podcast person and I wasn't aware of this podcast or its community of listeners, I don't think I was fully the right audience. It felt really voyeuristic at times, since they were jointly talking about their divorce and sharing some gnarly details together. I would have rather read a book where they talked about the topics they covered on the podcast, rather than a behind-the-scenes deal, because those bits where they shed some light on that were my favorite parts.","I received a free copy of, Slayers, Every One of Us, by Kristin Russo; Jenny Owen Youngs, from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Kristin and Jenny are now divorced but still love, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, they co host a podcast Buffering the Vampire Slayer. I loved watching Buffy, for the first couple seasons. This is an interesting read."
"The Rebel Romanov: Julie of Saxe-Coburg, the Empress Russia Never Had",Helen Rappaport,3.83,"The subtitle of this book (“Julie of Saxe-Coburg, The Empress Russia Never Had”) is a little misleading, because Julie (also known as Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna of Russia) was never meant to be empress of anything. Her brother-in-law, Alexander, was the sibling directly in line for the throne when she married into the Romanov family, and by the time Grand Duke Konstantin could've become tsar of Russia (a job he enthusiastically declined), he and Julie were already divorced. I mean, I suppose in a way that does make her an “empress Russia never had,” but by that definition I'm also an empress Russia never had. If there's ever a biography written about me, I hereby request that it also be subtitled in the same manner as this one, mostly because it'd be hilarious.Anyway. The Rebel Romanov is an entertaining glimpse into Julie's life and how the Saxe-Coburgs helped to shape the royal families of Europe. And, if I'm being completely honest, Julie is probably one of the least interesting characters in this book. That's not necessarily a bad thing – she certainly has a story worth being told – but her main claim to fame is marrying a Russian grand duke, a dysfunctional marriage that really only lasted a few years (they lived separated-but-still-technically married for a couple of decades, however). From then on out, she lived a relatively low-key existence, although not a poverty-stricken one as she still received a hefty allowance from the Russian government. Meanwhile, many of her relatives went on to hold extremely powerful positions across Europe – her brother, Leopold, became king of Belgium and her niece and nephew were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of the UK. And that's just the tip of the iceberg as far as Saxe-Coburg royalty is concerned – to say they were an incredibly ambitious family is definitely an understatement.And, yes, both Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert were relatives of Julie's. European royalty is so inbred, you guys. So many cousins marrying cousins, and one of Julie's brothers even married his niece. Blech. And don't even get me started on all of the infidelity … at least the resulting illegitimate children probably had a deeper gene pool, I suppose?As the author says in the epilogue, “much of Julie's life remains hidden from us.” There are numerous “might haves” in her story, and many documents that would have shed light on her inner thoughts and feelings have been intentionally destroyed or lost to time. Rappaport, however, has done a tremendous job of compiling the information about Julie that remains, and the history of the Saxe-Coburg lineage is truly fascinating. Anyone looking to learn more about the Romanovs, German history, or even the history of European royalty as a whole will likely find this book informative and entertaining. My overall rating: 4.25 stars, rounded down.Many thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review. Its expected publication date is April 15, 2025.","Marriage is hard. It is especially hard when you are a nearly broke German princess and you get married to a Russian prince who, how shall I put this lightly, has a significant personality disorder. Welcome to the story of Julie Saxe-Coburg!Helen Rappaport tells Julie's story in her book The Rebel Romanov. You may not have heard about Julie, but you probably did hear about many other people in this book connected to her like Catherine the Great, Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander, and various other royalty. Julie was a major part of the truly weird game of intermarriage that European royalty loved to take part in.My enjoyment and rating of this book is based mostly on Rappaport's writing. She balances numerous characters (who frustratingly usually have the same names) and gives an excellent picture of the time they all lived in. Major players are highlighted but never completely overtake the narrative.My singular issue with the book is a big one but not the fault of the author. Julie is not a very interesting main character at least as far as we can tell. Much of her correspondence needed to be kept secret or destroyed to avoid the ire of the Russian monarchy. Her exile from court meant she did not have any major influence on world events. It didn't help that she was also sickly (which may have been her husband's fault) and thus didn't travel as extensively as might be expected. Rappaport works with what she has, and the book is still very good. However, I think non-history nerds might be underwhelmed by Julie's story.(This book was provided as an advance reader copy by Netgalley and St. Martin's Press.)","This is a well-written, entertaining, meticulously researched biography of Julie of Saxe-Coburg. It is interesting and informative, and contains detailed and vivid descriptions of her life, court intrigue, traditions, locations, and historical figures. The footnotes, notes, bibliography and acknowledgements are enlightening, and are truly appreciated. Many thanks to Dr. Rappaport, St. Martin's Press, and NetGalley, from whom I received an advanced reader copy of this fascinating book. This is my honest opinion."
The 10: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road,E.A. Hanks,3.73,"If you’re looking for a juicy memoir from the kid of one of the most famous actors who ever lived, this ain’t it. This isn’t just a memoir about an attempt by E.A. Hanks to unpack and understand the trauma she experienced growing up with a mentally ill mother - it’s also about the trauma and nuance America carries, both of which she reflects on while traveling the 10. The story she tells about the relationship with her mother is mirrored by the story of a country grappling with its own history and failures. In the end, both stories feel fractured and complicated, but that’s the point.","I picked this because Ann Patchett recommended it. The fact the she is Tom Hanks’ daughter was an added bonus. This is weird and really goes off on some serious side tangents, but it still works. Intelligent and well written.","E.A. Hanks takes us on a remarkable journey with themes of minimalist travel, exploring childhood trauma, and healing. Hanks’ down to Earth personality and openness to where ever this journey was taking her is magnetic. She shares tidbits about her relationship with members of her family in such a casual way that is so endearing. The way she describes her journey of processing her trauma feels very relatable to this midwestern girl. There were so many times in the book where I just wanted to reach out and give her a “you are not alone” kind of hug."
The Year God Died: Jesus and the Roman Empire in 33 AD,James Lacey,3.96,"4 stars for a revealing book about Jesus, the 4 Gospels in the New Testament, and how the Roman Empire affected his execution. The blurb: ""In late 31 AD, after the Roman senators murdered Lucius Sejanus, the Roman Emperor Tiberius's closest confidant, the Empire was forever changed. If Sejanus had not been murdered, Jesus would never have been crucified.""The first two chapters are devoted to the author addressing two myths propagated by various ""historians."" The first myth is that Jesus was not a real person. He quotes various Roman sources mentioning Jesus and disproves this canard. The second chapter is more involved, as he sets out to prove that most of the 4 Gospels are authentic history. He agrees that parts of them are embellishments and untrue. He goes on to say that whole forests have been cleared by various authors advocating these two myths. He explains that while the Gospels were written after Jesus died, they were written by people who knew him and they were based on oral history recited repeatedly in front of audiences.Some other misconceptions that he addresses: Joseph. father of Jesus was a poor carpenter. The author meticulously presents evidence that he was more likely a master stonemason or a master contractor. Pontius Pliate was a indecisive ruler of Judea. But the death of Sejanus had put Pilate in difficult position and he had to walk a fine line so as not to offend Emperor Tiberius.One quote: ""By 30AD, it seems clear that Sejanus held it within his sway to appoint every governor and prefect within the Empire. Thus, there is very little doubt that Pontius Pilate was a creature of Sejanus, totally beholden to him for his position in Judea and whatever other ambitions he had once he returned to Rome.""I recommend this book to history and religion fans.Thank You Amy Jackson at Random House Publishing Group Ballatine for sending me this eARC through NetGalley. #TheYearGodDied #NetGalley. Pub Date May 20 2025 |","This book didn't catch my interest as much as I thought it would. If you're new to theological writings about Biblical times this might be a good introduction. If you're used to more academic and exegesis type books this might not be as good of a fit. It is clear that the author is an expert on ancient Rome, in fact he spends most of the book talking about it, but some of his claims about Jesus and Joseph go against much of current religious academia research. Some of his claims seem more based on opinion that research or primary sources. When the author does reference Bible verses, it appears that he relied on English translations. There is no mention of him going back to Greek or Hebrew writings. Furthermore, at the citations at the end of the chapters, he lists the Bible verses he referenced but not which translation he used.Thank you to NetGalley and the author for the ARC in exchange for my honest review.","I think I was a little out of my depth with this. I am definitely not an expert on the history of the Roman Empire, and don't have a ton of knowledge on Jesus' life and death besides the basics. This didn't just cover the year Jesus died, but many years before his birth, during his life, and then his death. Most of what is covered is the history of the Roman Empire and how it influenced Jesus' crucifixion. While the history is definitely interesting, there are a lot of people to keep track of and it can a bit dry at time with all the info dumping. The author did a ton of research, which shows throughout the book. He defends his stance, and points out why other scholars who don't believe in Jesus or the resurrection may have interpreted their research wrong.My biggest issue is with myself really. There was just so much I didn't know, and I think it would have helped me get into this more if I had. There were plenty of places and cities mentioned which used their names at the time that I needed to look up in order to understand better of where they were. And since I wasn't raised in a very religious household, I missed out on reading the Bible and learning more in depth about Jesus. Some things are explained, but there is definitely a lot that isn't, as it's assumed the reader is already aware of such things.This probably would have appealed to me more if I had had more understanding beforehand of the life of Jesus, but this will definitely appeal to those who enjoy history and religion, or anything to do with the life of Jesus.

The Tarot Architect: How to Become the Master Builder of Your Spiritual Temple,"Lon Milo DuQuette, Mary K. Greer (foreword)",5.00,Fan Girl Review I have been a long time fan of Duquette’s work in part because it very approachable and leaves one with the confidence to practice. Will I create my own deck probably not but will happily color as a meditation exercise. Worth the time to read once and then again and again to do the work.,"DuQuette states that for many, the Tarot serves as a compass that illuminates the path to ""true will"" and personal destiny. In her foreword, Mary Greer notes that the Tarot can be used to mirror one's experiences, as well as to manipulate one's experiences and the world around us. This is done with the use of magical correspondences initiated by the late 19th-century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Greer notes that the system integrates numbers, astrology, color, sound, geometry, letters, and the Qabalistic Tree of Life. In his section on building the foundation for reading the Tarot using the above correspondences, he introduces the reader to the Four Qabalistic Worlds, the Four Parts of the Soul, The Four Elements, Tarot Suits and Court Cards, In this section he also includes an active meditation.The section on the Tree of Life and the Sepher Yetzirah, addresses the ten numbers and the Tree of Life. This is also where we see the planetary spheres introduced. The section on the Cube of Space addresses the Three Primitive Elemental Trumps, the Three Dimensions, the Three Mother Letters, the Seven Planetary Trumps, and the Seven Double Letters.The sections on creating your own deck start with the Mother Letter Trumps, moving on to the Double Letter Trumps, the Simple Letter Trumps, the Lessor (Minor) Arcana, the Aces and Princesses, the Knights, Queens, and Princes, and the Small Cards (numbers 2 through 10). There is a full page black and white image for each card, with explanations of the imagery and symbols, and suggestions as to how to make the card your own. This book is replete with explanations, diagrams. exercises, and rituals to bring this information solidly into the reader's life. This is a book to be worked with, again and again and again. It is not something that you read and put down. The information is easy to follow and understand. The goal is to illuminate your own path by activating and integrating the wisdom and energy within the cards. This book would be of interest to those wishing to learn about the esoteric foundation of the Tarot and those wishing to integrate the Tarot as a tool of self-knowledge into their lives.",NA
I’m Glad My Mom Died,Jennette McCurdy,4.44,"I'm Glad Her Mom Died Too""Why do we romanticize the dead...?Indeed. Why do we?Before this book came out, my knowledge of Jennette McCurdy only extended to random gifs featuring her iCarly character, Sam Puckett. I didn't actually know who she was and what they were from, I just knew they were funny and fit my ""book review"" purposes. Here's an example:When this book dropped, however, I was drawn to the title, the gloriously vintage macabre book cover, and the fact that it was getting rave reviews. I was excited to read this and loved the cover so much that I purchased the hardcover drop instead of waiting for my library hold. I initially started this in early September, but for personal reasons I won't get into, I had to set it down for a bit. I have almost no triggers and can read pretty much anything without being all that affected, but - again - for personal reasons I won't get into, I found the details of Jennette's mother's behavior, narcissism, and emotional manipulation to be extremely triggering. And don't even get me started on the eating disorder triggers. I was also amidst a fairly stressful period in my work life, so I decided to wait until that was over before picking this back up. Fast forward a little over a month and my library audiobook hold was by then available, so I decided to jump back in with that format. Let me just say that I can't recommend the audiobook version of this highly enough. It is obviously read by Jennette McCurdy herself and I think she does a great job of it. I think the dichotomies of Jennette's life and story are very interesting and well explained. She is able to get across very nuanced and contradictory sentiments without sounding like a complete whiner. And that's a really hard thing to accomplish in practice. For example, she is able to outline how, despite understanding how privileged and ""lucky"" she was to be famous and on TV, she loathed acting, a lot of the fans, and the experiences that came with it all. ^See how assholey that's sounds just me saying it? Well, she nails it in the book, I promise you. I also felt very connected to Jennette and had a lot of empathy for her. I grew up in LA County and am VERY familiar with almost every location she references in the LA/Orange County area. I literally drive by the Westminster Mall (which she references being that she grew up in Garden Grove, and which is basically a nonexistent ghost mall now) every day on the freeway on my way to work. Also, I know I said I didn't want to get too woo-woo personal, but I will just say this: I deeply connected to Jennette in terms of understanding the longstanding effects (as a child who doesn't know any better) of being made to feel like you are responsible for the state of mind and emotions of another person - an ADULT person. For years. It steals your childhood, stunts you emotionally, and really takes a long time to work through. Some people should just NOT have children, folks. It's just that simple. I mean, what they say really is true: a lot of people spend their adulthood just trying to get over their childhoods. And that's even true for ""GOOD"" parents. But I digress. I liked how self-aware Jennette is. Or, at least, how self-aware she appeared to be in this book. That said, I also feel like this memoir came a little soon in terms of Jennette's recovery. She's very, very new to being on ""the other side"" of things. Although perhaps this book is a part of that, and so I can't fault her for that. And who am I to judge or criticize. Overall, this book was a great account of a very unique human experience. I will definitely check out any future books or content Jennette puts out in the future. And I'm rooting for her, her recovery, and her happiness.","praying that Jennette makes more from this book than Nickelodeon could’ve ever offered with their hush moneyA truly incredible and hard-hitting memoir. Whether you watched Jennette’s shows growing up (like me) or you don’t know her at all, I think this book is a must read. I don’t want to go into too many details, so I’ll just share some of my thoughts:• The writing is easy to read but still poignant. I think Jennette did a great job recounting the events of her life. I especially appreciate how she recounted her childhood; she really nailed writing from the perspective of a naïve child who doesn’t realize how awful her mother is.• I love how truthful Jennette was about her own fuck-ups. She admitted she was very aware of how bitter and rude she had become, and how ungrateful she seemed (obviously, I think she was justified). • I particularly loved the section about Jennette’s time on “Sam & Cat”. It showed how much her addiction, mental illnesses and eating disorders affected her work; how much Nickelodeon mistreated her, especially when compared to Ariana Grande; and how resentful she had grown over the years.• The exploitation of children in the entertainment industry is something that really needs to be discussed. Seeing a child star expose the abuse she suffered in the industry is truly heartbreaking, but extremely important, especially in this day and age, where even more parents are pressuring their children and forcing them to put themselves out there for fame. I wonder if in 10 years we’ll see similar testimonies from kids of family channels who grew up making money for their parents in an even more disgusting way: by having they entire lives documented and posted online for all to see. • Jennette’s friendship with Miranda was so wholesome <3• A bit of a critique: I feel like certain events were skipped and only mentioned later in the timeline (for example: we never see her audition for iCarly, or how filming the 1st episode was, suddenly it was already 3 years into the filming of the show, out of nowhere we find out that she’d been to multiple events and red carpets, she randomly mentions she knows she has OCD and EDs – I guess she learned and came to terms with it off-page…). Obviously, this is a memoir, so the author knows better than me what was important to document, but still, some of these things seemed kind of crucial in my opinion (especially her learning about her disorders).• The main reasons I’m giving it 4 stars is because memoirs are not really my thing, so I ended up not enjoying this as much as the other books I give 5 stars to; and because, as I mentioned, I think some things could’ve been a bit better. But, again, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to everyone!(review written on 24/08/2022)---this title is BRUTAL 💀 i'm so happy for her 😌 can't wait to read it!!(06/04/2022)","Shall we light it up? A bridge. It’s time.When I was in middle school, my mother told me that my glasses were ugly, that the children would call me Four-Eyes. Interesting Fact: No one has ever called me this but my mother. She taught me a cabbage soup diet and how to put on trash bags and go running to lose weight. At the end of a long day, my mom swung by a fast-food restaurant. She demanded that I go up and see what the operating hours were. Being super introverted, I hesitated. She started screaming, letting off a stream of obscenities.While I was in college in my early 20’s, I stopped by my mother’s apartment for a visit. She walked right by me in the parking lot.

This book really resonated with me.I’m Glad My Mom Died is an important work. It lets other people know that they aren’t alone, especially if their parents aren’t top 10% parents. Some parents are bottom 10% parents. It has been a long time since I have felt seen. The last book that I felt really conveyed the complexity of a dysfunctional parent-child relationship is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls. Did I spend years trying to win my mother’s love? Yes. But do I want to be the person that she would love? No. Because I value honesty and intellect. Because I don’t define my self-worth by beauty or popularity.

"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again",Jake Tapper,3.77,"PLEASE NOTE: I would be exceedingly grateful that if you are a Trump supporter that you bypass reading and commenting on my review. I honestly have no tolerance for what you have done to our country by voting for Trump or continuing to support him. Especially after serving witness to the havoc he and his cohorts continue to create in our country and abroad. Thank you.Full Disclosure: I wasn’t sure I wanted to read this book. And, I wasn’t sure why this book needed to be written by these supposed ‘respected’ journalists. Especially when it was learned that the anonymous sources who made up most of the alleged book’s claims were unreliable. The authors say they talked with 100’s of sources. And yet, only a dozen are ‘willing’ to be on the record, and barely any are standing behind ‘their’ quotes. What gives? Naomi Biden, President Biden’s granddaughter, considered this a “silly book” one that was filled with “political fairy smut for the permanent, professional chattering class.” Of course, she would defend her grandfather, but her concerns do pose relevant questions about the timing and true intentions for such a book.For those who still choose to believe this is another ‘I told you so’ story against Biden, I hope you will soon come to recognize the lack of consistency within this book, where ‘evidence’ to support the title of this book appears sketchy. I leave that to readers to discover. Mostly, this is my take on what really should have been discussed. I happen to be a true fan of President Biden and his illustrious career as a civil servant. And, in my continued, full disclosure I want it known that, I respect President Biden’s accomplishments while in service to our country. I recognize that he was imperfect, but I have to believe, being in the public eye isn’t an easy position for anyone. And, thus many trips and flubs will most likely be noted, especially by those looking for fodder. Still, we can’t help but note his vast accomplishments while President. To begin, Biden worked to minimize the damage of Covid, which Trump irresponsibly let enter our country during his first administration. Because Trump arrogantly and blatantly ignored the blueprint for handling pandemics that was left for him by President Obama and then Vice President Biden. Also, there were so many wins under Biden’s leadership. Some of which include but are not limited to…He created a phenomenal executive team of competent, well-educated visionary leaders; added millions of jobs, tackled junk fees, built a fairer tax system, worked towards affordable housing for Americans, provided for a healthy economy, gave our country the American Recovery Act, the Chips and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act; united, reinvigorated and strengthened NATO, supported Ukraine, supported student debt relief, protected Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare; advanced equality, racial justice and reproductive rights, delivered for diverse communities, provided for infrastructure funding across the states; as well, as continued to strengthen the pandemic response. Amongst many other programs that helped countless Americans. Including responding immediately to any weather induced or horrific crisis in which support was needed throughout the states. For anyone believing that our country wasn’t in a better place under President Biden, in comparison to our current circumstances under Trump (even his first administration), has to be delusional. Mostly, we as Americans could always count on Biden’s love of this country and the people, despite how they voted. He represented everyone. Equally. His son, Hunter Biden shared recently, “That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years.” There is so much to appreciate about Joe Biden for all that he has given to this country. That sometimes it is difficult to remember those moments when I was actually angry with him. The one time being when he chose to run again for President. I didn’t want him to do it. I thought he was only going to be a one-term President, and that was fine with me. By choosing to run, I believe he may have inadvertently set in motion the very circumstances we are facing in today’s world – and, especially in today’s un-United States. And, that is what concerned me then and now. President Biden deserves to be remembered for his legacy of service, not for whatever Tapper and his co-writer, Alex Thompson is choosing to blame him for within these pages. The dismantling of our country by Trump, a conman, criminal, and his unethical, spineless henchmen, and countless cult-like followers who have no decency to consider the truth of what their vote has done and continues to do to our country, is what we should be concerned about – not whether Biden’s health, or decision to run again is the deciding factor for the current mess are country is in. And, most of all, we cannot forget the flame that lit the fire in the first place. Mitch McConnell. I blame him most of all. Mitch McConnell is the lead factor for Trump being able to be in the oval office today. If McConnell would have done the right thing, by leading the GOP to convict Trump in the initial impeachment trial we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Trump was guilty, McConnell knew it, and he also knew it should have been handled on his watch as Majority Leader. He and his GOP complicit counterparts were just as guilty in putting our country in the hands of this authoritarian madman. The corruption continues relentlessly, and it astounds me that his followers are sitting by and letting Trump and his minions (those elected, and those who were not elected or legally appointed) to continue to get away with it. Shame on them. Tapper and Thompson consider this book a tragedy. Their description for Biden. They describe Biden as failing with political allies, or aides helping him through important conversations. A mental decline that should have been noticed sooner, by the authors as journalists. By Congress. By everyone. And yet, they offer no set date as to when the decline actually began.And, even if Tapper shares a sense of empathy for Biden, as a journalist he still felt the need to talk about the deterioration of the man’s mind openly. Tapper saw it as a cover-up. That needed to be revealed now. What Tapper and Thompson now consider their investigative deep dive into Biden’s deteriorating condition, and how ‘everyone’ protected him. So, is this an important story? Does it matter now? The point for me, is this really the story journalists need to be writing now? Regardless, did any of this impair Biden’s ability to do his job? Look at Biden’s accomplishments. Tapper/Thompson even concluded that his critics could “attest to Biden’s ability to make sound decisions.” So, what’s the big deal here? Look at all Biden had to endure during his Presidency. Even an impeachment of Trump and an insurrection incited by Trump prior to Biden taking office. And, with an uncooperative Congress at most times. And, the ridiculous and unrelenting lawsuits proving over and over again that the 2020 election was not stolen – despite what Trump continues to claim, Biden did his best to get legislation passed and funding to where it was most needed. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Tapper felt that keeping information from the public about Biden’s declining health could be considered a “horrible cover-up of something that wasn’t technically a crime, but you could argue morally it was.” Maybe Tapper/Thompson should be concerned about what is going on in Trump’s head, and that should be the real story. Not this one. Trump is the true moral crime. And since, the authors also concluded that staff and political allies felt Biden was able to do his job, again I ask, what is the big deal here about Biden?Because as Trump is unraveling and destroying literally every institution in America, shouldn’t this be something everyone should be concerned about now? And, what about the ‘words’ that come out of Trump’s mouth? Have the authors followed his speeches that don’t make sense? His erratic behavior which is always on full display, even as staff say to not take his comments seriously? His relentless and vitriol threats and verbal attacks on individuals and countries? The disinformation, exaggerations and lies and lack of historical accuracy that Trump spews? But mostly…Clearly laws are being broken, the constitution is not being followed, and Trump and his GOP administration show absolutely no respect for American democracy or the rule of law. “The president of the United States appears to have long ago forgotten that Americans fought the Revolutionary War not merely to secure their independence from the British monarchy but to establish a government of laws, not of men, so that they and future generations of Americans would never again be subject to the whims of a tyrannical king.” – J. Michael Luttig – Lawyer and former Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, “The End of Rule of Law in America” – The Atlantic, May 14, 2025PLEASE. Stop the madness. Stop going after or blaming Biden. Go after the true bully, the true criminal in this dark VERY present story. Remove Trump now. Impeach, Convict and Remove him from office. For real this time. We have a country and citizens to protect here. Please Tapper/Thompson re-direct your reporting energies. There are obviously more important things to focus on.",Honestly despicable. Maybe report on the president when he’s in office instead of keeping it for a book deal.,"as a book, tapper and thompson have produced a failure. there are a few tidbits of genuinely new information and a smattering of fresh reporting, but for the most part this is a shoddily constructed, if somewhat comprehensive, summary of events and information that anyone who consistently paid attention to political media in 2023 and 2024 will be well aware of.as a reporting project, it’s worse than a failure — a simulacrum of beltway media in miniature, an empty vessel and gaping maw. the idea that joe biden’s age wasn’t covered by the mainstream media (of which tapper and thompson are both part) is similarly silly; it was a near-constant topic. and for all his posing as a brave speaker of hard truths to power, tapper, in fact, spent an enormous amount of time repeating the administration line on another (genuine) scandal — american support for israel's horrific crime spree in gaza.at a time when hundreds have been kidnapped and shipped to a foreign gulag without due process, a lunatic billionaire and his amphetamine-encrusted teenage minions are destroying the federal government, and the constitution has effectively been suspended so that an aging madman and his cronies can rob the country blind for their own benefit, this book and the news cycle being foisted upon us by its supporters are a farce.joe biden is old? no shit. joe biden shouldn’t have run for re-election? no shit. we probably would’ve been better off if he’d never run in 2020? no shit. he and his inner circle’s hubris were an enormous (and probably decisive) factor in this catastrophe? no shit.to rehash all of this now, when the man himself has been stricken with cancer and the list of more pressing conversations is enormous, isn’t in the public interest; quite the opposite. it’s a testament to the vapidity of our political press that this book is getting anything but dismissive coverage."
The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness,Jonathan Haidt,4.35,"In Chapter 6, Haidt casually implies that more young people than ever are identifying as transgender or gender expansive due to ""social contagion"" theory. This theory posits that if your friends are transgender, you will become transgender. Social contagion is the root of the right-wing transphobic talking point of ""rapid onset gender dysphoria,"" which is the false claim of increasing numbers of children suddenly identifying as trans and then accessing hormones and surgery. In a 400-page book full of discussion on the gendered differences found among Gen Z users of social media and their mental health, Haidt spends approximately four paragraphs discussing the existence of transgender people. The three main text paragraphs are used to introduce rapid onsent gender dysphoria as legitimate: ""...[T]he fact that gender dysphoria now appears in social clusters (such as a group of close friends), the fact that parents and those who transition back to their natal sex identify social media as a major source of information and encouragement, and the fact that gender dysphoria is now being diagnosed among many adolescents who showed no signs of it as children all indicate that social influence and sociogenic transmission may be at work as well."" To back up these claims, Haidt cites a widely-discredited and debunked article on the phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria which has been taken up by the right wing to pass anti-trans legislation. Haidt also fails to interview any transgender individuals for the book, despite inclusion of interviews with cisgender individuals throughout. As of this book's publishing, 24 states have banned gender affirming care for youth. We know access to gender-affirming care is lifesaving and no child is walking into a doctor's office and leaving with hormones in hand. We also know about the disproportionate rate of anxiety, depression, suicide, and substance use disorders among LGBTQ+ youth. This book is lazy journalism at best and outright transphobic propaganda at worst.","4 StarsReviewing this book in a way that seems appropriate feels like a heavy lift that I'm just not capable of doing right now...and it's been a minute since I've read this, so I just want to get something down before this turns into an ""RTC"" in perpetuity review. So off we go...I apologize in advance for how crappy I'm sure this will be. I was excited to read this because - to be blunt - I basically wanted to be able to speak intelligently about something I already believe: that social media is evil. And before I get slammed for the hypocrisy of posting this here, hold your horses. I am aware that goodreads is technically a social media site. But it's not Tik Tok. It's not Instagram. It's not YouTube. Can it be just as destructive as any of those if someone gets overly invested and attached? Sure. But for the purposes of this review - and much like Haidt did in this book - when I reference social media, I am referring mainly to all the Tik Toks and Instagrams out there. Cause they are the parasites that are truly contributing to the ever-increasing rotting of our society. And yes, I really believe that. Just like I believed giving everyone a participation trophy was a bad idea back in the early 2000s. Do I think social media has its upsides? infinitesimally. And definitely not enough to offset the downsides. Cause our brains and minds were not meant to operate this way. It's just that simple. I thought the way Haidt unpacked the critical milestones and transitions periods of childhood was very well said and well researched. And the way he compared pre-smart phone childhoods to post-smart phone childhoods was very interesting. I very much enjoyed the earlier and middle portions of this book overall. As I stated above, everything was very well-stated and well-researched. I did think some parts were a bit redundant. And his solution plan...while admirable and logical...I just don't know how it would get it done, sadly. Regardless, I think this is a must read, especially for parents. Mental Illness, narcissism, and just an overall failure to launch has because an appropriate norm. And it's scary. Your friends and followers don't need to see every meal you ate on vacation or how many times you breathed in and out today. And they don't need a daily discourse about the status of your mental health. Stop navel-gazing. Seriously. It's ridiculous. We need to all get a grip and get the fuck off our phones.","Children should not have smartphones and social media until they are 16.As a parent of a young child, I read this book with interest and horror. This book is about the tragic great rewiring that was inflicted on Gen Z between 2010 and 2015 that completely upended them from a normal childhood and caused a generational mental health crisis. The author does a good job of explaining himself with good research and makes a compelling case against a phone-based childhood and praises the virtues of a play-based childhood. I think this book was very good and important but I didn’t agree with everything and think some of his reasoning is actually fallacious when it comes to “helicopter” parenting, which I’ll get into. Depression, self harm and anxiety are undoubtedly higher in Gen Z and have a sharp rise in boys and girls in 2010 and thereafter. One could speculate that these children grew up after the 9/11 era and after the 2008 financial crisis but, as the author argues, every generation has socio-economic upheaval but doesn't typically result in dramatic drop in mental health. The most likely, and obvious, explanation is that their childhood became steeped in toxic self comparisons on social media (affecting girls more) and video game and pornography addiction (affecting boys more.) Social media is a strategic, asynchronous, disembodied interaction with the aims of fostering and protecting an individual's self brand. Social media platforms are the most efficient conformity machines ever invented where a user can literally gauge approval by numerical likes and views. This is really bad for everyone and basically inhumane to expose a child’s brain to this type of thinking. When a child starts doing this around the age of 10, they chase the dopamine hit of views and likes and sink the enormous opportunity of real-life social interactions and development that prepare them for adulthood. Social media doesn’t just correlate with poor mental health, it is causative. I think the author demonstrates this beyond doubt. Children have “defend mode” and “discovery mode”, both useful but the former gets engaged more with a phone based childhood. Free and unsupervised play foster the discovery mode where children learn how to navigate not only the three dimensional space but relationships and their own feelings. A phone based childhood constantly puts a child in defend mode which spills over to real life and chronic anxiety. Social media inflicts sleep deprivation and social deprivation along with attention fragmentation and addiction. Again, these things are awful on an already socialized adult, imagine the cost on a child’s mind that has many years to go before adult brain development.According to the author, there are real gender differences between boys and girls which are almost certainly sociogenic (culturally created) and these differences account for the disparate impact of a phone based childhood on boys and girls. Girls strive for communion and relationship building where boys strive for self autonomy and actualization. These culturally programmed desires I believe are functionally very real. Girl aggression is relational which explains why social media impacts them more than for boys. Take all the self comparison to airbrush models on magazine covers from the 70s and now put that on hyperdrive, socialize it over a screen, adding cyber bullying and dopamine addiction, and you will have a very sad, lonely and anxious girl. For boys, video games can fragment their socialization and silo it off into asynchronous relationships that then addict and hamper their growth. The easy access to pornography, while impacting both boys and girls, seems to hit boys harder who consume it at very early ages.Here’s where I have a problem with this book: the author creates a false dilemma between a play-based childhood and phone-based childhood. These two things are not mutually exclusive and the author likes to partition them off like they are the only two options. As a parent who is very involved with my child’s life, I take umbrage with the term “helicopter parent” which the author uses. This well intentioned author asserts many times in this book that during the 1980s, parents become overprotective and stopped letting their kids have autonomy. My first response is what!? This generalization is overtly speculative and laughably simplistic. In my opinion, having more parental presence, particularly when it comes to safety, is not hampering children’s socialization and growth. I’m not joking here: the author thinks kids should be able to play in junkyards and with fire, unsupervised. Without presenting much evidence, he talks about the statistic improbability of your child being really harmed or kidnapped. Okay, but what about the stakes? They are enormous. I think it's a parents responsibility to protect them from catastrophe, regardless of how unlikely because the stakes are absolutely enormous. The author creates a false dichotomy that you either must let your children roam the streets unsupervised or put a phone in front of their faces. Of course, this is not true. There is an entire spectrum of parenting, one which could involve letting children roam under freeway overpasses while also sticking a phone in front of their noses for 6 hours a day. I found his take on this bizarre and his assertions that parent’s are hampering their children’s development with over supervision mostly unsupported. “Helicopter parenting” has become a term used by parents who don’t actively engage with their children. Anyway, I digress.The solutions the author offers are very good: no social media or smart phones before age 16 and phone free schools. He also laments the loss of spirituality and suggests we need to engage more in shared sacredness, self transcendence (the literal opposite of social media), be slow to anger and quick to forgive (never happens on social media) and to find awe in nature. Overall, I think this was a very good book that everyone should read."
From Here to the Great Unknown,"Lisa Marie Presley, Riley Keough",4.30,"My 100th book of the year! One of the best memoirs I’ve ever listened to. You get to hear actual audio recordings from Lisa Marie Presley and Julia Roberts narrates the other parts for her. Riley Keough also narrates a lot of it! Check TWs, this family has been through anything and everything you can think of. Definitely in my top 5 favorites of all time ❤️‍🩹","Listened to the entire audiobook at work today. Riley is what makes this book so special, she really honored her mother and family in such a beautiful way.","This was a rough read. It is deeply personal, I will give it that.It was much shorter than I expected it to be- around 280 pages. Honestly I felt like I could’ve read another 200 more pages, in sort of a morbidly fascinated way. Lisa Marie was ultimately, very human. Very flawed. Her childhood made up so much of who she was and how she saw herself, and I don’t know if she ever really got over the loss of her father. To me, at its core, this book is about generational trauma. Whether Lisa Marie wrote it to be that way, I’m not sure. But her daughter, Riley Keough, seems to understand that and reflects on it throughout her POV. I will say in advance that I do consider myself a Priscilla Presley “fan”- her life fascinates me and I think most attempts to vilify her come from a deep misunderstanding of her and her relationship with Elvis. But I’m also aware Lisa Marie felt like her mother failed her in a lot of ways, so I tried to go into this memoir without too much of a bias.  I’ve gotten the strong sense via interviews, stories, etc, that Lisa Marie had blinders on when it came to her dad. She was a self admitted daddy’s girl. If you’ve read previous interviews with her, you’ll see that she talks about Elvis with a kind of reverence similar to ride-or-die fans of his (and isn’t that what she is? Her father’s biggest fan? I mean, at some point, aren’t all daughters their father’s biggest fans?).The fact is, none of us, including her, have any idea what her relationship with her father would have been like as she got older. Would Elvis have been overprotective and controlling of her the way he was with Priscilla and other women in his life? Would his mood swings have grated on her eventually? What if Elvis had another child with one of his many girlfriends?Lisa Marie never reflects on that, but rather gives the impression of living in a sort of stasis- idealizing her childhood at Graceland, always wanting to go back. She describes growing up there as sort of a mythical place. She mentions incidents with a bit of a lack of awareness that can be grating sometimes- like she’s trying hard to normalize certain things. But maybe that’s how she dealt with it, ultimately, and we all have our own coping mechanisms.On a personal note, I will say that I’ve always seen a lot of my own Father and Mother in Elvis and Priscilla’s relationship. Like Lisa Marie, I too viewed my mother as extremely cold growing up, and felt like she didn’t want me around. It was only until I got older that I realized that since my Dad effortlessly played the part of the “fun” parent, my mom thought she HAD to take on the burden of being the strict one. My mother and I are extremely close now- so much so that it surprises people to hear there was a time where we weren’t. And I see some of my own experiences reflected in what Lisa Marie writes, but in quite a sad way. I don’t know if she ever grew out of seeing her dad as larger than life, and her mom as the one who had to cut through that. I actually did expect her to be harder on Priscilla (in fact, I expected her to be harder on a lot of people in the Presley sphere), only because Lisa Marie has always been extremely honest and passionate when she speaks- she never gives the impression of being rehearsed or edited. But in this book, she talks about her mom with a sort of apathetic tone, and I could never quite tell if it was her holding back all the hurt she had over their relationship, or if she genuinely felt no connection to her own mother. Lisa Marie talks about going back to Graceland, sleeping in her father’s room, eating in the kitchen, but she never acknowledges that Graceland would not be there if not for Priscilla. She doesn’t really talk about how being the daughter of Elvis set her up for success; we only hear about how it failed her, addiction wise. As far as I can tell from what I’ve read, Lisa Marie never really worked, or had a job. Her money came from the Presley Estate. She talks a bit about how every time she tried to make music, studios would interfere and try to make her songs more Elvis-like, but other than that… a lot of her struggles were singularly those of a famous figure’s daughter. And that doesn’t make her experiences less valid; I guess I just thought that for someone known for being so frank, there’d be more of an aspect of reflection on how lucky she was in certain ways. In fact, the book skirts around A LOT of finer details- for example, they never really explain Lisa Marie’s bankruptcy other than “her staff misused her credit cards”. It surprised me that she wasn’t able to see how much in common she had with Priscilla. Riley herself mentions it a few times. But as I wrote this review, I realized- Lisa Marie was incredibly headstrong, and lived life by her own opinions. Maybe she didn’t want to see. Maybe if she hadn’t died so suddenly, she’d have had more time to reflect.Or maybe not- the chapters regarding her son (and Riley’s brother) Ben’s death is like watching a slow car crash, one where you know more tragedy is right around the corner. That loss engulfed her, and it’s heartbreaking to read about her losing the will to live in the 2 years between his death and hers. One of the saddest parts of the sudden loss of Lisa Marie is that we won’t ever get to see her further reflect on her life. Time changes a lot, and like Riley mentions, her mother had only recently started to come to terms with the traumas she experienced.In that way, Lisa Marie is very much like her father, in the most tragic sense- her life was cut short before some things could ever fully be realized, or before her feelings could’ve changed. —This book does not touch on:- Many of Elvis’s relationships he had (Priscilla, Linda, Ginger, etc) or his friendships and how they effected Lisa- Any of the drama with the Presley estate - How Lisa Marie felt about the Elvis movie, and subsequently the Priscilla one (another surprise considering how much that was mentioned in the news when she passed) - The situation where Priscilla needed to take custody of Harper and Finley because of allegations against their father, Michael Lockwood - Any sort of commentary on Scientology; most mentions range from neutral to positive in nature- Another subject that went unmentioned that surprised me, was that other than a few scathing side-comments, Lisa Marie doesn’t talk a lot about the Memphis Mafia, which is surprising given that she’d been vocal in the past about their negative influence on Elvis. I came out of the book with the impression of the deep sadness of Lisa Marie’s life (I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her life as ""unfair"" as much as I would ""tragic"") and how grounded Riley is; it’s like she’s embodies the best parts of the Presley line (Elvis’s talent, Priscilla’s grace, Lisa Marie’s passion) while trying to overcome the negative parts that have haunted the family tree- the addiction, the drama, the extreme moodiness, the rollercoaster of highs and lows. If you go into this thinking it’s going to be a tell-all, extremely detailed read about the inner workings of the Presley's lives, it’s not that kind of book. It’s very much an intensely personal expression of Lisa Marie’s opinions and feelings. And I think ultimately, that’s why it could be divisive; her words bleed out all over the page and are bound to bring up personal feelings in the reader. But Lisa Marie did deserve to tell her story, in her words (and when that failed, in the words of her daughter), I just think it’s a shame, and almost melancholic, that her journey of reflection and expression ended with her sadly premature death. If there’s more things she wanted us to know, we never will unfortunately. But at the end of the day, maybe readers can take comfort in that, even if she didn’t explicitly state it, Lisa Marie is now where she most wanted to be- reunited with her beloved son, whose loss she never quite got over, and her father, the person she felt closest too in the whole world."
My Next Breath: A Memoir,Jeremy Renner,4.37,"Raw, heartfelt, and powerfully human from start to finish!Listening to My Next Breath: A Memoir was an emotional experience I won’t soon forget. Jeremy Renner shares his story with a kind of vulnerability that goes far beyond what I expected. This isn’t just about a terrible accident—it’s about the will to survive, the power of community, and a deep, abiding love for family.Hearing Jeremy narrate his own words brings an added weight to every moment. His voice cracks at times, and the emotion is always right there, close to the surface. The inclusion of real 911 audio from the day of the accident is nothing short of haunting. You can hear him in the background, moaning in pain, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking. I had to pause more than once just to catch my breath.The section about his neighbours—complete strangers who ran toward danger to help—restored my faith in humanity. Their courage and kindness were a light in a moment of unimaginable darkness. It reminded me how powerful simple acts of love and care can be.Jeremy reflects deeply on his life, his choices, and the man he wants to be going forward. His love for his daughter Ava is central to everything, and his vow to live with more intention and compassion shines throughout the memoir. While some parts felt a little repetitive, it only added to the sense of how consuming and relentless recovery truly is.This is a survivor’s story, but also a deeply human one. It’s about more than just getting through—it’s about choosing how to live after. Jeremy Renner opens his heart, and I’m grateful he did.And I also want to give a heartfelt shoutout to Tina for putting this audiobook on my radar. It was your beautiful review that convinced me to listen, and I’m so thankful you did. This experience will stay with me.","Wow, I have so much to say and yet don’t know how to start. We are so incredibly lucky that he chose to write this book. So many people can learn so much from hearing Jeremy’s perspective on his accident and life.Some thoughts:-While I usually like listening to the audiobook of memoirs already, this one was an absolute must to listen to with the added 911 audio and raw emotion in his voice. I will also be buying the physical copy. (Update 5/13: I absolutely DID buy the physical copy)-From the very beginning I was crying hearing Ava read her essay about her father😭 started off STRONG-You can hear his whole range of emotion from his experience come through while he is reading his words-Including his family’s and friends’ perspectives from the accident just added to this book even more-Just in his retelling of this story, you can see how incredibly selfless this man is-I lost count with how many times I said “wow”-Incredible storytelling and perfect title-Alex is truly a hero-Inspiring from start to finishReview: April 30, 2025","MY NEXT BREATH requires a trigger warning on the cover, written in bold, large letters: the story may cause a panic attack! Don't forget to breathe! Anyone who follows the news has heard of the snowcat (not snowplough) accident Jeremy Renner experienced on 1 January 2023. Yet, the rawness of the book still strikes hard. Jeremy Renner describes how he, remaining conscious, felt the pressure and release as six wheels of a 14000-ton machine smashed his body bit by bit. He retells his nephew's words: the nephew, stuck in a car, unable to escape, waited till the snowcat would pierce him. On the 911 calls, the reader (of an audiobook) could hear the author's groans. Jeremy Renner crossed the border to the other side that day. All people who went through near-fatal accidents find strength in different places. Jeremy Renner found solace in his family. He felt guilty for spoiling such a great day for them, especially for his daughter. He felt guilty for traumatizing his nephew, who had held his hand until the paramedics arrived, and his neighbors, one of whom had lost her uncle just a day before. It's relatively easy to get through the recovery process in this context: you get well for others, not for yourself. Looking at Jeremy Renner now, nobody would guess what he has gone through. That's the power of family love and resilience. I'd recommend listening to an audiobook narrated by the author. I warn you: be prepared for a shock! So far, MY NEXT BREATH is the best nonfiction book of 2025 for me."
Big Dumb Eyes: Stories from a Simpler Mind,Nate Bargatze,3.97,"A memoir being released by my favorite comedian? Yes, please. If you are already a fan get a copy. If you aren't a fan yet, you will be after you read this book. I recommend the audio and be sure to check out the pics in the PDF. We have tickets to see Nate in KC this September. Can. Not. Wait! 🤣Thank you to Grand Central Publishing and Edelweiss+ for a digital ARC and to Audio and NetGalley for an audio ARC. Such a delightful read. Love the clean content!","This audiobook gives all the feels! The stories are funny, heartwarming, and relatable. The Christmas elf, COVID barber, and Whataburger story are some of my favorites. Nate Bargatze’s narration was a treat and greatly enhanced the enjoyment and entertainment of this nostalgic collection. Thank you, NetGalley and Hachette Audio, for my audiobook.","Nate Bargatze has always been the kind of comedian who doesn’t need to yell or swear to get a laugh. He just tells you a story—usually something very normal that spirals into absurdity—and suddenly you’re dying over a conversation about whether sushi was invented in California or feudal Japan. (Spoiler: he’s not sure either.) That’s the magic here. It’s not big, dramatic punchlines. It’s him trying to explain to his wife that yes, he did go grocery shopping—he just went to one aisle, and it was the candy aisle.Big Dumb Eyes is basically a printed version of that lovable, bewildered guy we’ve seen onstage. It’s full of short chapters that feel like standalone bits: there’s the time he lived in an apartment that was basically a rat hotel, the saga of his busted Mazda with a tennis ball for a gearshift, and his slow realization that “adulting” mostly means arguing about chores and pretending to understand health insurance. Additionally, he’s joked for years that he doesn’t read books. He even has whole bits about how reading is hard. So the fact that he wrote one? That’s comedy in itself. But here’s the twist: he built in a workaround. I enjoyed the audio version. Nate reads it himself, and there’s just no substitute for his timing, his tone, and that sweet spot between confused and confident that only he can pull off. It's like hanging out with your funniest friend who also maybe once fell on his head.Reading Big Dumb Eyes feels like flipping through a scrapbook of someone else’s most embarrassing, ridiculous memories—and realizing you’ve basically lived them too. Bargatze doesn’t pretend to be wise or edgy. He’s just baffled, like the rest of us, and he’s somehow made a career out of it.It’s also worth mentioning: this is maybe the least offensive comedy book you’ll ever read. No vulgarity, no shock jock energy—just clever, observational humor that’s relatable whether you’re 22 or 62. You could give it to your parents, your kids, or that one coworker who always plays it safe with HR. And they’d all laugh.Bottom line? Big Dumb Eyes is like a stand-up special for your brain. If your brain is a little tired, a little distracted, and desperately in need of something fun that doesn’t require a whiteboard or a glossary, this is your book. Or audiobook. Or both."
Sociopath,Patric Gagne,3.76,"A mediocre memoir of neurodivergence, turned into a major book deal due to the author’s claim to be a sociopath. Having read the book—often sensationalized both in its scenes and its larger claims—I doubt it. My money says she’s autistic, though I believe she believes she’s a sociopath, and this book is a fascinating unintentional examination of the power of labels. That said, despite that “Ph.D.” on the cover (and there are valid questions about Gagne’s credentials, seemingly boiling down to the fact that she attended an unaccredited school and no one can find any of her scholarship), don’t expect any science in this book. As perhaps should be expected from an author who embraces a non-scientific term as her identity.Gagne’s primary symptom, according to her, is that from childhood she’s rarely felt much, and feels distant from her emotions even when she has them. Though she never uses the world, the term for this is alexithymia, and while it occurs in numerous contexts, it’s particularly common with autism. Gagne appears unaware of this. Certainly, when she was growing up (she’s probably in her 40s) there was little awareness of autism in girls, and her parents had none. She seems like a classic case, though: she describes a desire for solitude, invisibility and avoidance of small talk; not understanding social rules unless they were explained to her, and not always buying into rules if no one would be harmed in the breach; not knowing how to interact with others and having to learn it the hard way in her late teens, by consciously observing social interactions and imitating others’ body language (she calls this her “superficial charm,” but other neurodivergent people would just call it “masking”); and seeming strange to other kids for reasons she didn’t understand.At any rate, her feeling out-of-place and her mother’s increasing disapproval of her failure to express expected emotions and abide by social rules makes her anxious. Gagne manages her anxiety and gets herself to feel something through thrill-seeking, and her chosen thrill is breaking rules (the other reason she thinks she’s a sociopath). One wonders how different her life might have been had she been introduced to, say, extreme sports, but she settles on clandestine trespassing. She loves sneaking into places she’s not supposed to be, and the solitude and feeling of invisibility this gives her. This can definitely be creepy—she breaks into other people’s houses when they’re gone just to hang out there—but she has a preference for abandoned buildings or houses that are empty while awaiting sale (her mother is a realtor, which makes it easy). She also likes to secretly follow people and stare through their windows at night, and in college she makes a sport of charming drunk frat boys out of their car keys and joyriding in their cars (she fills them up and returns them afterwards). So… maladjusted, definitely a violation of modern American social rules, but not quite the height of criminality. And that’s pretty much the extent of Gagne’s so-called sociopathic behavior. She claims to have “violent and destructive tendencies,” but this appears to consist entirely of: 1) one time when she was a young child and stabbed a bully with a pencil, and felt great about it, 2) another time when she was a kid and feeling lousy, she squeezed a cat too hard, then let it go, 3) one time in middle school when she locked some other kids in the school bathroom to see what would happen and 4) as an adult, she almost jumped a woman who had just threatened her sister. I’m failing to see the deeply abnormal relationship to violence here.Meanwhile, despite her claims to not care about people, Gagne… pretty clearly does. She’s closely attached to her mother as a child, dependent on her to explain social rules, and enjoys the bonding experience of confessing wrongdoing to her. (Unfortunately Gagne doesn’t realize that this won’t continue to get a loving response when it keeps happening, and she’s deeply hurt by her mother’s conclusion that she is bad and wrong. The mother’s response definitely leaves something to be desired, culminating in the moment where she excludes Gagne from burying her own pet because Gagne isn’t displaying the expected grief.) She loves and admires her younger sister, and notes that she was never jealous because she didn’t want the spotlight. She has a fairy-tale romance with her husband beginning at age 14, when she apparently immediately knew that he was the one. She reports disappointment at not feeling a rush of love for her own children at their birth, but then not everyone does, and it’s no surprise that she does come to love them, given that even when nannying other people’s she describes “intense feelings for those kids and [an] instinct to protect them at all costs.”Also, as far as conscience, Gagne clearly doesn’t intuit or have much regard for social rules like private property, but she also does seem to have a moral compass. She thinks it’s important not to hurt anyone even if breaking the law. As a kid, she’s bothered by a neighbor kid who wants to harass her immigrant nanny and upset to see a teacher picking on a minority student. As an adult, she made me bust out laughing by gatekeeping sociopathy even as she reams out a woman (also a self-proclaimed sociopath) for covering up the woman’s dog killing a neighbor’s dog. Gagne feels she should be open about her “personality type” to friends and family, leading those with less compunction to ask her to engage in unethical behavior on their behalf because “you’re a sociopath, you don’t care,” which clearly makes her uncomfortable. Her self-diagnosis seems to work against her, though, because having founded her identity on being a sociopath who doesn’t care, she struggles to work out why she’s uncomfortable. Again, I can’t help thinking that many of her choices result from her leaning in to her own belief in her incorrigible badness: she actually portrays “the sociopath list” as a voiceover playing in her head as she goes through life.As for the diagnosis itself, Gagne picked up the word young from a prison guard uncle, to describe people who commit crimes and don’t care, and having been convinced that these were her primary traits, seems to have clung to it ever since. When she’s in her 20s her father finally makes her go to a therapist, but Gagne seems to have just demanded a “sociopath test” from the therapist without considering any alternatives. I definitely wondered at the competence of the therapist, who goes along with it despite explicitly noting Gagne’s many differences from the definition. Both Gagne and the therapist seem to interpret the discrepancies as “sociopaths aren’t necessarily what we’ve been told” rather than “maybe you aren’t a sociopath.”All of which leads us to: what even is a sociopath? Is it even a useful term, or just a media trope? The term is not in the DSM-V, which, okay—if Gagne had provided a reasoned critique of the DSM, I’d be here for it. Our understanding of mental health issues remains in very early stages, diagnosing symptoms as illnesses, guessing wildly at treatments, and generally failing to distinguish between actual pathology, different ways of being that are simply inconvenient for modern society, and adaptive responses to adverse events. Gagne doesn’t offer a critique though: she just identifies with the term “sociopath” and its descriptions far more than the DSM’s “antisocial personality disorder.” She also picks and chooses from definitions of sociopathy: she prefers it to psychopathy because it’s described as more malleable and treatable (on the theory that psychopaths are born while sociopaths are made, so could be unmade?), but fails to identify any environmental source for her own traits. (The only experience she describes as at all traumatic is other people’s reaction to her neurodivergence, which logically can’t have caused the neurodivergence. Though it probably did cause a lot of her behavior.) Also, those same sources seem to indicate that while you can have a well-adjusted psychopath, sociopaths are necessarily reckless and violent—otherwise they wouldn’t qualify for the definition. Gagne, though, just defines “sociopath” as whatever she is. At another point, she suggests it’s essentially “psychopath lite,” which feels right to her as a description of what she is but which does not appear to be used by anyone else.All that aside, the book is readable, but sensationalized. The TV-movie comparisons are accurate. It’s full of “reconstructed” scenes and dialogue dating back to Gagne’s early childhood, and the writing itself is bland. Overall, fine for a quick read if you’re willing to read between the lines, and I agree with Gagne about the need to stop stigmatizing neurodivergence, but I don’t think this book has much to do with or to say about sociopathy. Skippable.","THIS is why I love memoirs!! Being able to learn about something new, through the eyes and voice of someone who is living it. This is about Patric and her everyday life being a sociopath. Fascinating, especially as someone who loves all things psychology","I don't believe a word this woman wrote. I was automatically suspicious of her, so I looked her academic credentials up. She has her MA and PhD from a school called the California Graduate Institute, which is essentially a diploma mill. Whether she is a sociopath or not is moot, she is a fraud."
"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",David Grann,4.18,"4.5 Stars. I was excited to read the Kindle edition of David Grann's The Wager. This is an astoundingly and painstakingly well-researched book of historical non-fiction. It is a story of the shipwrecked Wager, a tale of death, destruction, betrayal, and survival. Some of the events and names of characters involved were well-known in the 1700s but have been lost in history. David Grann has revived the incredible story with his meticulous research. I read the ebook on my Kindle and found it difficult to put down. I wanted to know who would survive in such a storm-swept place and what the outcome would be. The central characters were well-drawn, and many others were named Grann’s The Killers of the August Moon, and the Lost City of Z had fewer characters to sort out, and they read more like fiction, but this story was more complex and far-reaching.I had heard about press gangs who grabbed men off the streets, forcing them to work on the ships. These were often criminal elements and the scum of society. The author draws an incredible picture of invalid and injured veterans hauled out of hospital, some carried on stretchers onto the ships to perform naval duties.  I had not known that upper-class boys as young as 14 could join the Navy with the ambition of becoming future officers and gentlemen. John Byron is featured as an example. He attended a private school and was expected to be able to draw, fence, dance, know classics and mathematics and some Latin while learning about tasks onboard the ship. He is forgotten today despite a successful naval career, but he was the grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. The book is lavishly illustrated with excellent, helpful maps and 28 other well-chosen pictures. There are portraits of several of the main characters painted during their lifetimes, paintings of the Wager, etchings of the survivor's life on a desolate, remote island, photos of this place in the present and from 1742, pictures on how to amputate legs and arms. If you are reading an ebook, I recommend you switch to an iPad to enlarge the illustrations and view them in colour. A squadron of ships, including the Wager, was launched in 1740 by Britain to establish British domination over Spain and control the sea and trade routes with the aim of empire building. A secret mission was the capture of Spanish gold and silver. Conditions onboard the outbound ships were horrific. They were filthy, with sickening odours, vermin and insect-infested and hunger. There were many deaths from scurvy, tetanus, and infections. Healthy food and sufficient water were lacking. Excessive numbers of the crew were too sick to work. After the shipwreck, it is no wonder that hopes of survival were grim. Those who remained alive descended into savagery, treachery, theft, anarchy, mutiny, murder, and even cannibalism.  Two hundred eighty-three days after the Wager was believed to have sunk in a raging storm off Patagonia with all aboard lost at sea, a small, roughly constructed boat made it over 3,000 miles to Brazil. It had started the journey with 81 men, but now only 30 sick, skeletonlike men were barely alive. Six months later, a smaller boat washed up in Chile with only three men, who were emaciated, covered with bugs, delirious, and near death. Members of both groups feared returning to England because they thought there could be sufficient charges to warrant death by hanging following an Admiralty trial. The newcomers blamed the first group of mutiny and abandoning crew members on shore to die from thirst, cold weather and starvation. There were countercharges of murder and treachery. The author describes the trial and leaves it to the reader to draw their own conclusions.","“They had been shipwrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. Most of the officers and crew had perished, but eighty-one survivors had set out in a makeshift boat lashed together partly from the wreckage of the Wager. Packed so tightly onboard that they could barely move, they traveled through menacing gales and tidal waves, through ice storms and earthquakes. More than fifty men died during the arduous journey, and by the time the few remnants reached Brazil three and a half months later, they had traversed nearly three thousand miles – one of the longest castaway voyages ever recorded. They were hailed for their ingenuity and bravery. As the leader of the party noted, it was hard to believe that ‘human nature could possibly support the miseries that we have endured.’ Six months later, another boat washed ashore…”-	David Grann, The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder David Grann’s The Wager is an entertaining entry in the robust subgenre of shipwreck literature. The boat in question – the titular HMS Wager – sported twenty-four guns and a crew of around 120 sailors and marines. In 1741, during the War of Jenkin’s Ear, it was part of a squadron led by Commodore George Anson, which was looking to make trouble for the Spanish on the Pacific coast of South America. Unfortunately, due to poor seamanship – compounded by a crew laid low by scurvy – the Wager ran aground near the Patagonian coast, after getting separated from the rest of the squadron by bad weather. The men made it to shore, where they built shelter and tried to rescue supplies from the ship. Despite their efforts, the famed discipline of the Royal Navy broke down. It did not take long before the situation made The Lord of the Flies look like a pleasant day at Sandals Jamaica. Factions formed. A separate encampment sprung up. Food was pilfered. Orders were disobeyed. Some men did a lot of work; others did none at all. Captain David Cheap shot a man in the face without warning. Running low on food, part of the crew mutinied, and set out in a boat, leaving the captain and two midshipmen behind, setting up parallel survival stories that would eventually – against all odds – intersect again. The bare outlines above clearly show the vast potential of this material. It has the makings of a great story, and needs only a competent storyteller. Thankfully, Grann is exactly that. *** In his prior book – Killers of the Flower Moon – Grann was able to deliver a solid murder mystery that also doubled as a larger critique of the treatment the United States government meted out to the Osage tribe. Here, Grann clearly wants to do the same thing. To that end, he makes a couple not-entirely-convincing attempts to place the Wager’s ill-starred voyage into a larger context of imperialism. For the most part, though, he recognizes that – to use an infamous tautology – the tale contained in The Wager is what it is: a disaster at sea, no more, no less. It is not a world-historical event; it is not representative of anything. There is no deeper meaning to be derived, other than what can be learned about human nature under duress. Leaving aside these halfhearted pretensions, The Wager is sturdily, pleasingly old-fashioned in its scope and execution. Grann starts with a prologue that essentially outlines what is to come, and then lets things unfold chronologically over five separate sections, that neatly divide the action. Just over 250 pages of text, this is a quick, efficient book that never lingers too long or strays too far. *** As he has shown in the past, Grann has a good nose for underappreciated historical events. More than that, he understands that a nonfiction story is only as good as the available documentation. To bring the past to life, you need evidence, and that is not always present. Thankfully, Grann not only chose to write about a relatively unknown disaster, but one in which the participants wrote a bunch of stuff down. This is important for two reasons. First, it allows Grann to create memorable characterizations, especially the aforementioned Captain Cheap and his erratic decision-making; Gunner John Bulkley, the leader of the mutineers, who proved both a marvelous sailor and a solid literary craftsman; and Midshipman John Byron, the eventual grandfather of Lord Byron, who at the time was just starting a long, rather fruitful naval career. Second, Grann is able to present a visceral sense of place, whether that is the canting deck of a warship, a distant, seemingly-uninhabited island, or an open boat on the vastness of the ocean.*** Even a well-documented eighteenth century shipwreck necessarily suffers from some evidentiary gaps. This difficulty is heightened by the fact that two competing groups of men gave two extremely conflicting versions of what happened. For example, both Bulkley, who faced hanging as a mutineer, and Captain Cheap, who faced the end of his career, had ample incentive to place themselves in the best possible light. Grann is at his most masterful when presenting and weighing contradictory accounts while maintaining a seamless narrative. Grann is also very judicious in his use of filler. While the central storyline is inherently fascinating, he adds to it with valuable side discussions on life in the Royal Navy, the effects of scurvy, and the indigenous people that the castaways met, and then thoroughly alienated. His digressions are so good that I didn’t even mind that The Wager kept going even after it reached its natural conclusion, since it involved a well-described naval battle in which Commodore Anson captured a Spanish treasure ship laden with pieces-of-eight. *** Good stories are their own justification. Nevertheless, it seems to me that Grann wanted The Wager to say something big. Ultimately, though, it has to settle for saying something specific: that humans are complicated. Some are mostly good, some are mostly bad, but most are a combination of each, and it can be hard to know a person for certain until your ship has sunk, the food has run out, and thousands of miles of tumultuous seas stand between you and home.","Calling All Armchair Detectives!

Counting the Cost,"Jill Duggar, Derick Dillard, Craig Borlase",4.01,"full video explaining a lot more of my thoughts: HEREThis is the book Jinger could not write - a full expose on the Duggar family dealings, how the parents use the family machine and religion to control their children, and the hard, hard work of therapy and coming to know yourself that it takes to leave. Now I say Counting the Cost is the book Jill - not Jinger - had to write. Because for a people pleaser, a favorite child, and the first to get married and to leave, Jill was the guinea pig for what it meant to be a Duggar Daughter. As a former IBLP Daughter - I felt Jill's emotional, hard-wrought struggle. The day she wore pants for the first time, her father's ensuing meltdown, the tension of longing to please, yet desperate for freedom - that journey was achingly familiar. The anxiety I felt the entire last third of this book - if you grew up with a controlling, manipulative parent - you too will understand. Because controlling parents are not just in fundamentalist cults. They exist across religious and cultural lines. And rarely, rarely, does anyone have the courage to explore family estrangement. Jill outlines the cost of estrangement - the cost to not set your boundaries and the cost once you do. Also 100% true to experience to spend 200 pages outlining extreme parental abuse to end with the small steps you’re taking to reconcile with said parent. Because completely cutting off a parent is next to impossible and the desire to one day please them is ever-present. Ugh, I see myself in Jill’s voice so much.Bravo, Jill. Bravo to all the IBLP Daughters who have fought so long, and so hard, for our voice. The cost is beyond what anyone outside of IBLP could ever grasp. But the freedom - the joy - and the peace beyond IBLP is well worth every penny.",this woman just fully outed her father committing tax fraud,"This book is not some sort of juicy tell-all. It is not the Duggar version of Jennette McCurdy's book either, though they share themes of child abuse and exploitation by the media. Jill's memoir is a straightforward recounting of growing up in the IBLP cult, being exploited by the Duggar show and by her father, and the steps she's taken towards healing and independence.I disagree with the conservative views that, as far as I'm aware, Jill and her husband still hold. As an ex-Christian and a fundie snarker, I privately hoped to see more deconstruction of her upbringing and beliefs in this book, especially following the excellent Shiny Happy People documentary this summer. Jill is not critical of Michelle, despite how clear it seems to me that she has enabled and supported Jim Bob behind the scenes. All of that said, deconstruction and healing come in all forms, and I found myself so happy for Jill and the emotional work she's done. Before therapy even came up in the book, I noticed her word choice referring to her ""inner critic"" and responded like ""Yes! She's gotten therapy!""The work is no literary masterpiece, but it is still effective in its matter-of-fact tone at highlighting the systemic issues surrounding the Duggar family. There's an interesting intersection here between capitalist media, abusive family dynamics, and religious control. The combined balance of power seemed to weigh against Jill in every direction, and I'm proud of her for her self-advocacy. She does not go into detail about her experiences with Josh, and I respect that choice. That story was broadcast to so many people already, and her retraumatization has been so potent that I'm glad she has firmly decided not to talk about it. While I do think abuse needs to be talked about in order to be addressed, this should never be done without the consent of the victims and without giving them control over how the story is told.Overall, this memoir plays it very safe, and this is probably a wise tactical move on Jill's part, especially given that she does not want to burn bridges with her family. Reading this book, it seems impossible to cast her as disrespectful, rebellious, or uncaring, though other fundamentalists still somehow do so. It's disheartening that Jim Bob and Michelle's response seems to be disappointment in Jill for telling her story publicly rather than handling it privately, though we see in the book that it's easier for the Duggar patriarch to maintain control and perpetuate imbalances of power when these issues are kept private. Although Jill doesn't take her deconstruction as far as I'd like to see it go, this work communicates how deeply she does not want to cause pain to others, and that in itself is very moving."
The Art Thief,Michael Finkel,3.95,"Dear Goodreaders: Though ""The Art Thief"" is a short book (just over 200 pages), I worked on the project for more than 11 years, trying to make sure that everything in this wild and unpredictable tale is true - and also, to the best of my abilities, entertaining to read. The art thief himself, Stéphane Breitwieser, granted me dozens of hours of exclusive interviews, and even visited a couple of museums with me. It was a bizarre experience, to say the least, to tour an art museum with one of the world's greatest art thieves. I respect all of the reviews here (well, almost all), and I hope that the art thief's incredible crime spree, and his equally spectacular crash, capture your interest. My time with Breitwieser changed the way I experience museums and absorb works of art, and I expect that the same effects may happen to you as you wind your way through the book.Yours,Mike FinkelPS: Since you made it down this far, I'll admit which is my personal favorite line in the book: ""When you wear your heart on your sleeve, it's exposed to the elements."" (p.74)","The Art Thief is a narrative nonfiction so it reads almost like fiction. But this amazing story is true. Crazy to think that so recently in the past, someone could get away with stealing hundreds of pieces from various museums. Yes, not the big museums, but still! It was surprising to learn that Breitwieser didn’t go in for lots of advance planning. He was a think-on-his-feet kind of thief. The book veers between the story of the various art heists with commentary by various psychologists, all of whom tried to determine what led him to steal. Meanwhile, Breitwieser declares “Art is my drug”, as if that is all the explanation needed. The book also provides a unique look at the European legal system. I was shocked to learn that Breitweiser’s many thefts were deemed as less serious than a theft of some cheap item if a weapon was used in the latter. In fact, the amount of time he served was shocking to me. The person who comes across the worst here is his mother. Breitwieser granted Michael Finkel hours and hours of interview time, so the book definitely has the feel of a one on one conversation. I found it odd that Stephane Breitwieser is consistently called by his last name, while his girlfriend and accomplice is called by her first name, Anne-Catherine. It was refreshing to read a true crime story with no violence involved. My thanks to Netgalley and Knopf for an advance copy of this book.","The Art Thief by Michael Finkel is True Crime Nonfiction!The Art Thief is a fascinating True Crime story that verges on the unbelievable... Stéphane Breitwieser professed to steal art not for money, but for love, an estimated $2B worth, in the years between 1995 - 2001. What he loved was Fine Art, primarily Renaissance Art and medieval art.  Leisurely visits, smartly dressed in upper-end clothes, to museums and galleries throughout Europe with his then-girlfriend Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus would net something of interest. He performed the theft and she would be on the lookout. They would seamlessly blend into the crowd, take their time, never rushing the door or speeding away. Breitwieser and Anne-Catherine lived in two small rooms in the attic of his mother Mirelle Stengel’s house where the stolen art was on display all around them. Sleeping close to, being able to touch, and see the art was part of Breitwieser's obsession and thirst for what was now theirs alone to enjoy.There is a great deal of information packed into a fairly short book and, because there are so many thefts, it can feel repetitive and confusing. It reads like a suspense thriller without the mystery of how it will end. We already know the ending. To dig deeper will reveal a character study, a relationship study, and a family study that rolls up into a compelling True Crime read/listen. The audiobook is a 5H 39M listen narrated by the magnificent voice of Edoardo Ballerini. Although an audiobook will always be my preferred format, I do recommend sourcing a physical copy of this book for all the lovely color pictures of the ""loot"" found in the notorious attic rooms. The Art Thief is a fun, entertaining, and compelling nonfiction read/listen I recommend to readers who enjoy reading edgy nonfiction books. I listened to it with my mouth agape!4⭐"
The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet,John Green,4.36,"I don’t fail to see the irony in reviewing a book that’s essentially all about reviews, but I was actually pretty surprised by this book. One minute he’s talking about hot dog eating contests and Dr. pepper and the next he’s talking about human loneliness and connection and life during a pandemic. It was actually really cool to read a book that talked about COVID and the struggles of living during a pandemic, this is the first book I’ve read that really talks about it. I also really enjoyed hearing about his relationship with his brother Hank, and their discussions about the meaning of life. This book ends on a really great note, the ending gave me goosebumps. Thanks so much to Libro.fm for providing me with an advanced listening copy!",I give John Green's ability to make me view the world with hope and wonder 5 out of 5 starsWatch me discuss this book in my May wrap up: https://youtu.be/ouTm4bZ6TQw,"I received a copy of this audiobook, read by John Green, through libro.fm and their ALC Program.I am not super familiar with the podcast of the same name, but still, I knew that I was predisposed to love this. And love this I did. This is perfectly what I enjoy in a collection of essays: each essay well crafted, but all tied together by a strong central theme. Green writes with the flair of a seasoned storyteller so that I can imagine even readers who are not usually fond of or used to non-fiction would find it easy to sink into The Anthropocene Reviewed. These are stories, after all, told accessibly, in beautiful language, and by a keen observer. In his postscript, Green reflects on the contradictions of the human experience, the wonder of it all alongside the misery of it all. Throughout this work, Green captures those contractions well. He flawlessly ties together bits of human history and invention with personal stories, presenting both with equal skill. The macro parts of the story are clear, concise and well presented. The micro parts are vulnerable and full of emotion. I found myself also experiencing the highs and lows alongside the author. It was particularly emotional hearing Green muse on his own writing, on the pandemic, and on his relationship with his family, themes that appear throughout. Also layered throughout is a love of art and literature. At the end, Green wonders if his work is too full of quotes, as he is too full of quotes, but any other readers also full of quotes will find it a joy. I finished the book and wanted immediately to listen again. To slowly go back through and pick out those quotes, to do a few deep Google searches into Monopoly or geese or the QWERTY keyboard. To experience again the coziness of someone telling me an interesting story, about himself, but also about myself, and also about us all. I give The Anthropocene Reviewed 5 out of 5 stars."

The Diary of a Young Girl,Anne Frank,4.20,"Why do we write reviews?You have a lot of reasons I guess.But for this review there is only one. I am writing this for my conscience. Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with-DO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresome.I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world. No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now?Well she didn’t survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back.","I confess to feeling slightly voyeuristic while reading this. It was constantly in the back of my mind that this was no ordinary novel, or even a true-to-life account. This was someone’s diary. Every page written in confidence, each word revealing the thoughts closest to the heart of this young girl. As a journal-keeper myself, I sometimes find myself wondering, “What if someone else were to read this?” which causes me to wonder how much to filter my words. But then, isn’t the purpose of a diary or journal just the opposite? To record one’s honest and unfiltered thoughts? While reading Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl I do not get the sense that there is any such ‘filtering’ going on. From the ages of 12-15 Anne lived an extraordinary life, and quickly grew far beyond her years in her understanding and handling of a horrendous situation.There are surprises in this book. No matter how broad or limited your understanding of the world events that threw Anne and her family into a life in hiding, I had – before reading this – held the general assumption that, “Well, it was wartime. They were in hiding for their lives. They must have been miserable all the time. Who could possibly find anything good or redeeming in the confines of such a life?” In hindsight, of course, I have had to reconsider. I found bits of beauty, kindness, and even humour popping up in the most unexpected places. And why shouldn’t I? Aren’t our lives much the same? Oh – we’re not dodging bombs and trying to sleep to the sound of gunfire (at least not in Canada). But we, each of us, are often faced with some sort of tragedy or travesty. Sometimes we may have an entire ‘bad year’, or longer. And yet, doesn’t the buoyancy of the human spirit always shine through? It is really tough work to be miserable 24 hours a day. No matter how difficult or challenged our day-to-day life, we all have those little pockets of joy that arise, and sometimes it is those tiny occurrences that make the rest of it bearable.On a personal level, I found myself comparing Anne’s childhood to that of my parents. After all, she was only a year younger than my Mom and Dad. I think back to stories they’ve told from their teen years, and it boggles the mind to think that at the exact moment my Dad and his brothers were tipping a cow, Anne was in hiding on the other side of the world. At a time when my mother was discovering make-up, Anne was realizing that life would never again be so youthful, so joyous and carefree as before the war. A generation was losing its innocence, but in very different ways.I would recommend Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl to absolutely everyone, for I believe that it holds some truth or enlightenment for everyone. I do not own this copy – it was borrowed from my daughter’s school library. She will be reading it next. She is 10. And you can bet that before long I will purchase my own copy, for I will be reading it again someday soon.","If only Anne Frank's diary was the figment of someone's imagination. If it meant that this spirited, intelligent and articulate girl hadn't died along with so many others in Belsen concentration camp, and that the holocaust had never happened, that would be a wonderful thing, but it did happen, and that makes the reading of this diary even more heartbreaking.For a 13 year old girl, Anne was so articulate - the way she expresses her thoughts and feelings about herself and others is remarkable. She's able to analyse herself in a particularly honest way, her abilities, failures, weaknesses.As Jews in Nazi occupied Holland, Anne and her parents and sister Margot, had to flee their home in Amsterdam to escape capture. From 1942 - 1944 they occupy rooms in an old office building, which they call 'The Secret Annexe'. Anne's diary details daily life within the confines of their safe house. They share the rooms with another couple and their teenage son and also with a former dentist. As can be expected, there were many disagreements, living in such close proximity to others, and even within their own families. Just a few of the office staff knew about The Secret Annexe, and these are the people who kept them supplied with food, but given the fact that everything was rationed due to the war, things became a bit fraught at times. The alternative however, didn't bear thinking about.In August 1944, Anne's diary suddenly becomes silent. No more words will be written in its pages. Someone had betrayed them to the Nazis and they were arrested and transported to various concentration camps. The diary was left behind and was found by the office cleaner. After being interned in two concentration camps, Anne and her sister Margot were finally sent to Bergen-Belsen where they both died - Anne was just 15 years old. Only Otto Frank (the girls' father) survived, and the diary was returned to him.This is one of those books where a silence descends on finishing it. How do you write a review? How do you do it justice? I honestly don't know. All I can think is, what a great contribution Anne would have made to an ugly world if she'd lived, her ambition was to be a writer, and yet, even in death, she HAS made a contribution by allowing us to share those two years in hiding with her, and giving us a chance to see what a beautiful soul she was. Feel so sad right now."
Educated,Tara Westover,4.47,"On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.
Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times
We had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene’s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.
…he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers’ award is a really exciting one.

Whenever I don’t know a lot about something, I’ll read a textbook or watch an online course until I do.I thought I was pretty good at teaching myself—until I read Tara Westover’s memoir Educated. Her ability to learn on her own blows mine right out of the water. I was thrilled to sit down with her recently to talk about the book.Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in rural Idaho. Her dad had very non-mainstream views about the government. He believed doomsday was coming, and that the family should interact with the health and education systems as little as possible. As a result, she didn’t step foot in a classroom until she was 17, and major medical crises went untreated (her mother suffered a brain injury in a car accident and never fully recovered).Because Tara and her six siblings worked at their father’s junkyard from a young age, none of them received any kind of proper homeschooling. She had to teach herself algebra and trigonometry and self-studied for the ACT, which she did well enough on to gain admission to Brigham Young University. Eventually, she earned her doctorate in intellectual history from Cambridge University. (Full disclosure: she was a Gates Scholar, which I didn’t even know until I reached that part of the book.)Educated is an amazing story, and I get why it’s spent so much time on the top of the New York Times bestseller list. It reminded me in some ways of the Netflix documentary 
Wild, Wild Country
, which I recently watched. Both explore people who remove themselves from society because they have these beliefs and knowledge that they think make them more enlightened. Their belief systems benefit from their separateness, and you’re forced to be either in or out.But unlike Wild, Wild Country—which revels in the strangeness of its subjects—Educated doesn’t feel voyeuristic. Tara is never cruel, even when she’s writing about some of her father’s most fringe beliefs. It’s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.Of the seven Westover siblings, three of them—including Tara—left home, and all three have earned Ph.D.s. Three doctorates in one family would be remarkable even for a more “conventional” household. I think there must’ve been something about their childhood that gave them a degree of toughness and helped them persevere. Her dad taught the kids that they could teach themselves anything, and Tara’s success is a testament to that.I found it fascinating how it took studying philosophy and history in school for Tara to trust her own perception of the world. Because she never went to school, her worldview was entirely shaped by her dad. He believed in conspiracy theories, and so she did, too. It wasn’t until she went to BYU that she realized there were other perspectives on things her dad had presented as fact. For example, she had never heard of the Holocaust until her art history professor mentioned it. She had to research the subject to form her own opinion that was separate from her dad’s.Her experience is an extreme version of something everyone goes through with their parents. At some point in your childhood, you go from thinking they know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. I’m sad that Tara is estranged from a lot of her family because of this process, but the path she’s taken and the life she’s built for herself are truly inspiring.When you meet her, you don’t have any impression of all the turmoil she’s gone through. She’s so articulate about the traumas of her childhood, including the physical abuse she suffered at the hands of one brother. I was impressed by how she talks so candidly about how naïve she once was—most of us find it difficult to talk about our own ignorance.I was especially interested to hear her take on polarization in America. Although it’s not a political book, Educated touches on a number of the divides in our country: red states versus blue states, rural versus urban, college-educated versus not. Since she’s spent her whole life moving between these worlds, I asked Tara what she thought. She told me she was disappointed in what she called the “breaking of charity”—an idea that comes from the Salem witch trials and refers to the moment when two members of the same group break apart and become different tribes.“I worry that education is becoming a stick that some people use to beat other people into submission or becoming something that people feel arrogant about,” she said. “I think education is really just a process of self-discovery—of developing a sense of self and what you think. I think of [it] as this great mechanism of connecting and equalizing.”Tara’s process of self-discovery is beautifully captured in Educated. It’s the kind of book that I think everyone will enjoy, no matter what genre you usually pick up. She’s a talented writer, and I suspect this book isn’t the last we’ll hear from her. I can’t wait to see what she does next.","""It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you""I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .Tara grows up free or wild. She didn’t bathe that often, didn’t wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc. I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid forPlus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College isn't cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she didn't seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to ""learn"". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who doesn't want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I don't care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book. What worked for me in this book was Tara's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just wasn't for me.I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing group and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"
Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner",4.01,"This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category.""","I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction._________________________[Update, Jun 26 2022]In view of the Supreme Court's recent ruling, I wonder which Republican-led states have started planning for the increased levels of crime that are to be expected fifteen to twenty years from now, and which ones have decided it won't be necessary. In the second case, it would be interesting to know why not. A couple of suggestions to get the ball rolling:a) this is liberal science and can be discounted as political messaging,b) the Rapture will occur first.","Sure, this book was a compelling read that offered us all some great amo for cocktail party conversation. But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible."
Outliers: The Story of Success,Malcolm Gladwell,4.19,"Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better."" While I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling. Moreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food? My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more. The students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practicing. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.) In the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters. ""2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.""Friday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, ""So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?"" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, ""YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started."" Thank you for your work Galdwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities).","When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye."" At first glance, his work seems thoroughly researched, even visionary at times. Beginning with a few maverick, counter-intuitive insights, he often ends with an affirmation of consensus, but it is a consensus that has been broadened by investigation and enriched by nuance.On second look, however, I'm no longer sure any of this is true. What first appeared to be new insights are nothing but familiar landmarks, previously unrecognizable because of the adoption of a deliberately mannered perspective; even the once apparent breadth and nuance now seem triumphs of language over logic, the apparent inevitability of his arguments an illusion conjured by the spell of his limpid prose.Take one small example from ""Outliers."" With a flurry of standardized test statistics, Gladwell makes the case that the traditional summer vacation--however rewarding it may be for the middle class--is just not working for the poor. (I'll concede the point, for the sake of argument, but any high school teacher will tell you how suspect conclusions drawn from such statistics can be.) He then presents a sustained anecdote about a successful all-year-round secondary school in a poor neighborhood. His conclusion? We should go to school year round. Sounds reasonable, right? But what about a more obvious solution: as a society we could decide to work together so that summer can be a learning experience for the poor by instituting a myriad of basketball camps, music camps, art camps, chess camps, traditional summer camps, etc., held at schools, community centers, and city parks, and staffed by college students, artists and teachers from the neighborhood. Gladwell often reminds me of the last panel of a Dilbert cartoon: two panels of plain-speaking criticism, followed by one panel of resignation. And no real insight, no real hope for the future.","I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.There are a number of ways I can tell a book will be good; one of those ways is if Graham has recommended it to me (how am I going to cope without our lunches together, mate?). And there is basically one way for me to I know that I’ve really enjoyed a book, and that is if I keep telling people about it over and over again. Well, not since Predictably Irrational  (also recommended to me by Graham) have I gone on and on about a book to people. First to Ruth over lunch, then to mum on the phone, and then the kids after they had just gotten out of bed in the early hours of the afternoon – my poor children, I’ve told them virtually the entire book.Now it is your turn.As a culture we tend to believe that people who are successful (people like Mozart, Bill Gates, The Beatles) all are ‘self-made-men’ and have risen to the summit of achievement on the basis of some incredibly special power they have and that we do not. It is a comforting thought, in some ways. If we have not done as well we are hardly to blame, because we just didn’t have that certain something. We don’t have the thing that sets them people apart from the crowd. And in this cult of celebrity we even get a chance to live vicariously in the reflection of their glory. Perhaps we can never all be Lady Di, (at least, not in public) but we can all attempt suicide with a pate knife and get into colonic irrigation. John Safran talks somewhere about a guy he knows saying to him that the only reason John made it and he didn’t was because John was Jewish. John then talks about how much hard work he had to put in to becoming successful, none of which relied on the mythical leg up he would have gotten from some secret Jewish conspiracy. This book isn’t about Lady Di, but it is about a series of biographies of people who have become incredibly successful. The biographies are generally told twice. The first time in a way that confirms all our prejudices about self made men and then in a way that makes sense of the success in ways we may find much more uncomfortable. I really struggled with this book – I loved every minute of it, but I still felt remarkably challenged by it. It was very hard not to think of my own life while reading this book. And this did not make me feel comfortable.I guess we are all fairly predictable, and one of the things that makes us especially predictable is that we generally like to have our prejudices confirmed. We buy books that tell us over and over again what we already know and believe. The Left Behind series is just one such example, as are most self help books. And I’m as guilty of this as anyone else. But there is a much better sensation we can get from a book, although this is much more rare. It is when the person you are reading starts telling you the deeper reasons why your beliefs are valid and not just based on prejudice. I have always believed talent is another (although, less apparent and all too vague) word for hard work. I’ve also believed that we are products of a range of different variables too complex to know in any real detail. This book confirms those prejudices.First he talks about ice hockey and a fascinating fact about the birthdays of the best players. They are all born at around the same time of the year. It is as if there is a cut off date for when you will be a professional ice hockey player – and, in fact, there is. The short version is that if you are born on the wrong side of the date they use to group kids into age levels you are likely to be a year younger than the other kids you are playing ice hockey with and therefore a year smaller than them too. That is going to make them look like they are better players than you are – and they will be too. A year at 10 is a huge difference, a huge advantage. And then we compound that advantage, by giving the older kids more practice, more experience in games and then more experience and more practice until there is no way the kid who happened to be born on the wrong side of the cut off date has any chance of catching up.The point he makes strongly here and repeatedly in the first part of the book is that there are other factors to success that are more than just ‘natural ability’. In fact, he does not believe in ‘natural ability’ – only in effort and time. Essentially he shows that if you put in 10,000 hours on any task you will be highly proficient at that task. Innate ability does not exist and ability is actually a function of effort expended. This is both liberating and incredibly challenging. Liberating because success is related to the effort you put in (and I think you should believe that is true even if it isn’t – it is the myth of Sisyphus, the only way we can really cope with the world is to believe our efforts have meaning). Challenging, because ultimately we are responsible for our own success as we are directly responsible for how much effort we are prepared to put in.The second great theme of this book is that where you come from matters. The culture that we are from has a remarkable impact on the rest of our lives. For example, if you are from a working class background you are much less likely to approach life with an attitude of ‘entitlement’. When people in authority speak to you, you are probably less likely to question them. In fact, you might believe you should defer to them. You are probably more likely to believe rules exist for a reason and that rules can’t be changed and can’t be moved. People from the middle class are much more likely to see rules as things that can be shaped or changed or ignored to make their life more easy or rewarding. Having come from the working class, even a particularly radical end of it, I can still see aspects of this deference in my own character and this was perhaps the most challenging part of the book for me.The other challenging bit was the part about the Hatfields and McCoys. As a Northern Irish boy, even if I’m not as obsessed with ‘honour’ as I might have been, this does make sense of things I have wondered about for a long time. The solution might be a little too neat, but the Irish, particularly the Northern Irish, are far too likely to feuds that are intractable and recognising that that might have cultural roots beyond the excuse of religion is utterly fascinating to me.The lessons of this book can be put into a brief sentence: success depends on a series of cultural and other factors that are mostly beyond your control – however, the thing that is totally within your control about success is how much effort you put in. And the more effort you put in the more likely you will be successful. They are directly proportional and we should all praise work as the key thing that really makes us human.I loved this book. I noticed that Ginnie points to a pilot who disputes some of what Gladwell says about culture and plane crashes, but this is a minor point. His bigger point about culture and plane crashes still stands and is remarkable. If you have kids, read this book – it will give you hints on how to bring them up with perhaps a modest sense of entitlement – it could make all of the difference. Ginnie also has a link to an article with a photo of the man himself – I was saying to the kids yesterday that I would give a couple of toes to look nearly as cool as he does, but I think it would take more than just toes.Look, what can I say? Read this book, it is life altering. Well, maybe not life altering, but a delight nonetheless."
Becoming,Michelle Obama,4.44,"Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-	Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”-	Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?-	Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-	Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-	Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?-	Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite” -	Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?-	Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-	Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).-	Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.-	Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-	Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-	Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.-	Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-	Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”-	“Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97-	“Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97-	“I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97-	“Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99-	“There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99-	“He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101-	“Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103-	“He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105-	“Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105-	“Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111-	“This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112-	“I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117-	 “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123-	“All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131-	For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-	She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-	Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-	She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-	She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-	She failed the bar exam the first time around-	She very much dislikes politics-	She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-	She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-	Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-	She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.-	She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”. That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.	As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. 	Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the pussy” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.","I didn’t think I could admire and respect former First Lady Michelle Obama any more than I already did. For eight years she graced our country with her presence, her intellect, her caring. We never had to ask because it is obvious in everything she says and does that she does care. Without a doubt, she cares more than anything about her family, but also cares deeply about this country. Then I read this book, an eloquent memoir, strikingly honest and as inspiring as I suspected it would be. I felt even more admiration and respect for her. She recounts her time growing up on the South Side of Chicago as she shares the joys of her childhood as well as some of the tough things. She was a feisty child, driven to do well in school. Her story begins : “I spent much of my childhood listening to the sound of striving.” She speaks lovingly of her roots in this working class family - her parents and her brother and grandparents and how their values shaped the adult she would become. We witness the grief she experienced over the loss of her father and her continuing admiration and love for her mother who was tenacious in seeking a good education for her children. In this memoir, she is so open and honest and it feels so intimate. Michelle shares her love for her husband and daughters. She speaks about the discrimination against the men in her family, about being black at Princeton, about the attacks on her husband’s citizenship, a conspiracy theory primary pushed by the person who unfortunately followed him after his second term. We discover who she is in the times she is undergoing a self discovery, as she questions her aspirations, as she juggles work and motherhood as Barack’s involvement and aspirations in politics grow. It felt so intimate as she shares some personal struggles that they faced, ones that I don’t think she ever divulged publicly previous to this. The things she chose to focus on as First Lady - children and their health, assisting military families, developing a program for mentoring young women reflect the things that are important to her and the kind of person she is. With an intellect such as hers, she easily could have taken on larger policy issues, but instead focused on children and families bringing people into the White House who would not have had the opportunity to be there if not for her. This book is over 400 pages and it never felt long. The writing is good and I just kept turning page after page always interested in what she would say next. A remarkable story of a remarkable woman.","I’d been lucky to have parents, teachers, and mentors who’d fed me with a consistent, simple message: You matter. As an adult, I wanted to pass those words to a new generation.
Look, I'm not a happy crier. I might cry at songs about leaving and missing someone; I might cry at books where things don't work out; I might cry at movies where someone dies. I've just never really understood why people get all choked up over happy, inspirational things. But Michelle Obama's kindness and empathy changed that. This book had me in tears for all the right reasons.This is not really a book about politics, though political experiences obviously do come into it. It's a shame that some will dismiss this book because of a difference in political opinion, when it is really about a woman's life. About growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago; about getting married and struggling to maintain that marriage; about motherhood; about being thrown into an amazing and terrifying position.I hate words like ""inspirational"" because they've become so overdone and cheesy, but I just have to say it-- Michelle Obama is an inspiration. I had the privilege of seeing her speak at The Forum in Inglewood, and she is one of the warmest, funniest, smartest, down-to-earth people I have ever seen in this world.And yes, I know we present what we want the world to see, but I truly do think it's genuine. I think she is someone who really cares about people - especially kids - and wants to give them better lives and opportunities. She's obviously intelligent, but she also doesn't gussy up her words. She talks straight, with an openness and honesty rarely seen. She's been one of the most powerful women in the world, she's been a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School, she's had her own successful career, and yet she has remained throughout that same girl - Michelle Robinson - from a working class family in Chicago.I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America",Erik Larson,4.00,"Poor Erik Larson.He wanted to write an extensive, in-depth look at the 1893 World's Fair, which was a collaboration of some of the greatest creative minds in the country (including the guy who designed the Flatiron building in New York and Walt Disney's dad) and gave us, among other things, the Ferris Wheel, the zipper, shredded wheat, and Columbus Day. The entire venture was almost a disaster, with delays, petty fighting, bad weather, and more delays, but it was ultimately a massive success and helped make the city of Chicago what it is today. Here's what it must have looked like when Larson pitched his idea for the book:Larson: ""And the fair didn't go flawlessly - towards the end of the fair, the mayor of Chicago was assassinated by a crazy guy, and there were tons of disappearances over the course of the fair, and a lot of them were probably the work of this serial killer who had opened a hotel near the fairgrounds - Editor: ""Wait, serial killer? And it's connected to the fair? Cool, let's try to include that in the book. Also the crazy assassin sounds good, too.""Larson: ""No, the killer - H.H. Holmes - really wasn't connected to the fair at all. I mean, he used the fair as a way to collect victims, but he would have killed tons of people even without it. In fact, after the fair he moved on and kept murdering people, so the fair really didn't have any effect on his methods...""Editor: ""Doesn't matter! How about you alternate between chapters about the fair and chapters about Holmes killing people?""Larson: ""But I don't really know much about that. Nobody does - Holmes never admitted to killing all those people, even after the police found human remains in his basement. I don't really know any actual details about the killings.""Editor: ""That's okay, you can just make it up. I'll give you some trashy crime novels to read, that'll give you some ideas. Now tell me more about the assassination.""Larson: ""He was just some mentally unbalanced person who thought he deserved a position in the mayor's office and shot the guy when he realized it wasn't going to happen. But the death cast a pall over the entire closing ceremony of the fair, and it - ""Editor: ""Good, let's sprinkle in some bits about the crazy guy throughout the book, too. Now, back to Holmes: did he maybe kill somebody at the fair, or did they find a body on the grounds or something?""Larson: ""No, the Chicago police didn't even notice anything was happening. It wasn't until he left Chicago that a detective from another state tracked him down.""Editor: ""Okay, so we'll make the end of the book about the manhunt for Holmes and his capture.""Larson: ""What does any of this have to do with the World's Fair?""Editor: ""Hell if I know. You're the writer, not me - you figure it out. Here's a check. Now go make me a bestseller!""Four stars for the World's Fair stuff, two stars for the pulpy unrelated bullshit.","This book is two, two, two books in one!Sorry, that was annoying. But it’s almost as if Erik Larson wrote two really short books—one about the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and another about the murder spree of Dr. H. H. Holmes—and then shoved them together to create a single story. The result isn’t bad, and I think Larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives, but it’s hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related. Yes, Holmes lived in Chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin’ yo’ people up!), but the events didn’t weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it. No alarm bells went off anywhere in Chicago as a result of his, um, unsavory indiscretions.Still, there is a lot of interesting stuff here, information specific to the world’s fair, and it is fun to learn new things. For example, the Chicago Columbian Exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world’s first ferris wheel, it led the nation in its first public observance of the Pledge of Allegiance, and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution. Even that awful snake charmer song has its origins in the Chicago World’s Fair.

While writing this review, I’ve come to learn that Leonardo DiCaprio, that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body, is producing the film adaptation, and will also play the role of serial killer H. H. Holmes. For this I am pleased.",4.5 FASCINATING!
We Should All Be Feminists,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,4.40,"This is the single most convincing essay I’ve ever read on feminism. It does not point fingers and blame men for a cultural mind-set they were born into. Instead, it offers calm logical arguments for positive change going forward. And that’s what the world needs:
“A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: We must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.”
Adichie states that the strongest feminist she ever knew was a man, and that’s kind of important. This is an essay about building bridges; it appeals directly to men and asks them to look at the world differently: it ask them to look at their actions, ones which were harmless and indirect, but were nevertheless sexist: it tries to make them open their eyes.“The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn’t have the weight of gender expectations.”“I am trying to unlearn many lessons of gender I internalized while growing up. But I sometimes still feel vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.”Gender is the key. Adichie gives an example of how when she first became a teacher she wore male orientated clothing on her first day. She wore a suit so the students would take her more seriously rather than just dressing in a way that made her comfortable. She sacrificed her individuality because of gender expectations. In order to be more authoritative she dressed like a man because a woman would not have had as much respect in such a situation. And that’s truly sad. The same is true for men who feel unable to express their emotions because such a thing is considered weak and unmanly. We all have the capacity to feel and the fact that fiery emotions are considered a feminine trait is just, well, odd. But that’s the world we live in. Adichie proposes that we ignore such stupid labels and be whoever we wish to be: we are ourselves. There’s so much negative stigma attached to the word feminist. This book is the true face of modern feminism, read it and you will not be able to fault its logic.
We should all be feminists after.

I am angry. We should all be angry.
A short, sharp, and effective essay about gender, the wrong ideas many people have about feminism, and why it is so damn important. Even today.I suppose an ""essay"" doesn't sound like something most people want to rush out and read. It sounds like a chore, like hard work, like something that you should maybe read... someday... if you ever get around to it. But this doesn't feel like an essay at all. The author delivers a compelling and deeply personal account of her experiences and the experiences of her friends - male and female, young and old, Nigerian and American. She makes many fantastic points and makes them in a conversational tone, without seeming preachy or patronizing. Looking at the way we treat women and men, and how the expectations we have of both genders is contributing to a gender divide, the author makes an argument for a better future where we are not put into gendered boxes.
We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.
I've actually written a little about this in the past, but I especially like the way she draws attention to the importance of the word itself. Many people are quick to say: ""I absolutely believe men and women should be equal, but why call it feminism? Isn't that word exclusive? Why not say humanism (as many people do)?"" Even I've been guilty of wondering the same in the past.I think there are many great arguments for why it should be ""feminism"" and not just ""humanism"", ""black lives matter"" and not just ""all lives matter"", ""gay pride"" and not just ""sexual pride"", but I'll let Adichie do the talking on that issue. She summarizes it marvelously.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store","I’m tired of feminists picking on the weakest, turning into bullies, using their platform to harm someone who is already vulnerable. At this stage, your feminism is as good as worthless if it doesn’t include trans women. This essay is hailed as an introduction to feminism, but honestly, go pick another book. Don’t build your feminism on hate and ignorance.Find more of my books on Instagram"
Man's Search for Meaning,"Viktor E. Frankl, Harold S. Kushner (Foreword), William J. Winslade (Afterword) ...more",4.37,"I read this book for the first time during my senior year in high school. The year prior, I had gone to Germany for spring break with some fellow classmates. During the trip, we spent a day visiting a former WWII concentration camp in Dachau. As one might expect, this visit had a profound effect on me. I had of course read and knew about the atrocities that occurred under the Nazi regime, but to actually see a camp in person is a deeply haunting and disturbing experience. Perhaps for this reason, Frankl's book affected me even more deeply than it otherwise might have. The book is divided into two parts. The first section recounts in vivid detail Frankl's horrifying experiences as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. Frankl, a former psychiatrist, also describes his observations of other prisoners and what he felt to be the main way in which people tried to cope with the insurmountable obstacles they faced. He found that those who could find meaning or purpose in their suffering were the ones who also seemed better able to find the strength to go on. As I recall, Frankl personally found his purpose in the hope of someday being able to see his wife again - a hope that was strong enough to get him through the daily horrors he faced.The second half of this book is devoted to the therapy he developed based on the search for meaning, which he calls logotherapy. The basic premise is that those who can find meaning in their suffering are better able to cope with what would otherwise be a struggle too hard to bear. As one who majored in psychology, I found this section as fascinating as the first.I have read this book at least three times now, and it is one of the few books I can say truly changed my life. I am ever grateful that I have the wisdom of this book to fall back upon when needed. Several years ago, at a very young age (in my 20s), I became ill with a disease that left me bedridden and barely able to speak above a whisper. Now 36, I am still bedridden and fighting the same battle. It is Frankl's reminder to find meaning and purpose in suffering (which I found in the love of my fiancé and my hope of recovery) that has helped me to get through each difficult day. As Frankl tells us, ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.""I highly recommend this book!!","After I read this book, which I finished many, many years ago, I had become self-critical of any future endeavours which would take up a lot of my time. I would ask myself ""is this or will this be meaningful to me?"", and if the answer was ""no"", I wouldn't do it. It was this book that influenced me to consciously live as meaningful a life as possible, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that ""meaningful"" doesn't always mean ""enjoyable"". ""Meaningful"" should be equated with ""fulfilling"". So I studied Physics instead of Engineering. I went to York U instead of U of T. I went to Europe instead of immediately entering the workforce after graduation. I want to recommend this book to all of my grade 12 students.","How is it possible to write dispassionately of life in a concentration camp in such a way as to engender great feeling in the reader? This is how Frankl dealt with his experience of those terrible years. The dispassionate writing makes the horrors of the camp extremely distressing, more so than writing that is more emotionally involved. It is almost reportage. The first half of the book is equal in its telling to The Diary of a Young Girl in furthering our understanding of those dreadful times.There are occasional glimmers of humanity from the Germans. These are so small that rather than illuminate any basic goodness, they cast further into the shadows the terror of living in a place and time where death might be a beating or a shot to the head at any moment. There are also stories of the depths that some of the Jewish victims would sink to in what they would do to stay alive themselves. It made me think that rather than condemn these people for becoming tools of the Nazis, what would I do faced with death or the chance to stay alive a little longer and maybe save family or friends. 7 stars, golden stars for this half of the book.The second half is about Frankl's psychotherapeutic methods and lost me in boredom. I did read this in its entirety but it wouldn't have spoiled the book, or my appreciation of the genius retelling and brilliant writing of the first half, if I hadn't."
